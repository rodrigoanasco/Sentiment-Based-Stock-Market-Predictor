Stock futures opened flat to slightly higher Wednesday evening ahead of the final session of the year.

Contracts on the Dow added about 30 points, or 0.1%, after the index hit a fresh record closing high during the regular session. The small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a gain of more than 1%, and the S&P 500 closed within 0.1% of its recent record closing high. Emily McCormick

Tuesday‚Äôs moves lower came after prospects that consumers might receive bigger direct checks to stoke spending appeared to diminish. Though House of Representatives passed a measure to increase stimulus checks to $2,000 to most Americans, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scuttled Democratic senators‚Äô efforts to quickly advance the payment increase in the Senate on Tuesday. He also suggested the chamber would only consider the measure in tandem with other provisions unpopular with Democratic lawmakers.

‚ÄúLate Tuesday, the House of Representatives voted to pass a bill increasing the stimulus checks to $2,000 from $600, as Trump had demanded last week. However, it remains unclear when or whether the GOP-controlled Senate would take up the bill for a vote. And many Republican members of the chamber previously opposed any payment sum greater than that already included in the $900 billion stimulus package.

Stimulus developments aside, U.S. equities are also likely benefiting from the seasonal period deemed the ‚ÄúSanta Claus rally,‚Äù which extends over the final five trading days of the year and into the first two sessions of the new year. Over the past 50 years, stocks have ended this period higher 77.9% of the time, and with an average gain of 1.33% for one of the best seven-day periods of the year, according to LPL Financial.

The three major indices are also set to post strong returns this year, after rallying strongly off of their lows in March and flipping from bear to bull market with record velocity. As of Monday‚Äôs close, the S&P 500 was heading toward a 15.6% rise in 2020, the Dow for a 6.5% advance, and the Nasdaq for a staggering 44% jump as Big Tech and software stocks outperformed for much of the year.‚Äù Emily McCormick

2020-12-17,VTGN Might Run Nicely in the Short and Long Term,"VTGN Might Run Nicely in the Short and Long Term Hey Everybody,

So I posted sometime today or yesterday on r/pennystocks and VTGN went up. I have been trading and following this group for a year, and this is my first attempt at a DD post. I just want to thank you all for helping me, whether I lost or won, because I overall learned. So on to VTGN. I believe that their mental drugs have the potential to be very big and make. I believe it will one day leave penny stock land as it reaches for the stars. I strongly encourage you to check out their website, and perhaps you might believe me then. I'm sure we all are well aware of the increasing mental health complications from the pandemic, and it has become a norm. I'm not a financial advisor and this isn't advice, just a guy encouraging you to check out their stuff and maybe buy the stock! I'm giving DD on VTGN, but any advice and critique in the comments would be awesome. Note: I have also posted this on the penny stock subreddit, so you can go check out the people's opinions there too. This is my first DD.

**The Full DD (I also have presented an optional DD below).**

Please skip to point 2-3 if you only want to look at the short term for this stock, and are not interested in anything else I have to say. After reading this, I hope you can consider checking out their website: [https://www.vistagen.com/](https://www.vistagen.com/). I also encourage you to check out the other DD post (I didn't write that but it's got good stuff).

Again 5 years from now this might be a huge stock. These products are really useful and applicable to everyone in society, including people suffering **from bag holding, PTSD from SLS/GNUS/IDEX/other crashes, or from selling a stock a day before it jumps 1000% while. at the same time losing a good percentage of your portfolio.** So VTGN drugs would be right for you, and not cause you to suffer the negative side effects of other mental drugs like benzodiazepines. But all jokes aside, this thing actually might be a gold mine.

***Point 1: The Potential*** **- Good for Long Term**

Another thing is that 1 drug there is (and there's many in the pipeline) can target many mental health complications. For instance, AV-101 is proposed to treat: major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation, neuropathic pain, levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and epilepsy. If it gets accepted for all of these conditions (and again we are discussing only 1 drug, they have 2 others that target many other conditions too), then we should expect this to leave the galaxy and more. But that's more towards the long term. It also provides a safer bet, because let's say for AV101, it fails to treat LID, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain, but it treats suicidal ideation and depressive ideation... it's still. going to jump hard. If all of them get accepted, then oh lord those poor shorters. They can probably use VTGN's drug.

***Point 2: The Funding*** **- Good for Short term**

Vistage does offerings here and there, and according to the news article posted today, they do this to acquire money to fund their ambitious drugs. It requires so much money, but if it passes (which I believe there's a high chance of, because there investigating its ability to treat so many conditions at the same time), there going to be making a lot of money, and revenues will be up like never before. But regardless, they need money. The US Congress is proposing a stimulus relief package that would immensely help VTGN: [https://twitter.com/JulieNBCNews/status/1338591826069114897/photo/3](https://twitter.com/JulieNBCNews/status/1338591826069114897/photo/3) (CNBC posted this, so don't be afraid about the Twitter part). I want you to take a look at the third image of the relief plan. **$5 billion stimulus check for substance abuse prevention and treatment, and mental health, that might be approved in the next few days.** This is big and VTGN is trying to become the major player for mental conditions, so I expect to see a spike in the short term as well.

***Point 3: The Institutions and Short Interest*** **- Good for Short term**

Ok so I was expecting shorts to be all in on this with that 0.0001 underwritten offering (please help me understand what that means)... but according to the link below this sentence, the short interest **is only 16%**... which makes me super happy. So I probably don't need the drug VTGN is making lol.

Source: [https://fintel.io/ss/us/vtgn](https://fintel.io/ss/us/vtgn), **Institutions are also still in.**. making me happier.

As for institutions there still in, you can check the same link to get info on it.

So today it went up, but after hours it crashed hard. Then it went even **up harder** to a dollar. This is the only article that came out,: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/17/2147384/0/en/VistaGen-Therapeutics-Announces-Proposed-Underwritten-Public-Offering.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/17/2147384/0/en/VistaGen-Therapeutics-Announces-Proposed-Underwritten-Public-Offering.html). But I also suspect that the stimulus check is going to send this thing up.

VTGN went past a dollar today. I hope you guys put it on your watchlist and watch it during the premarket. Be alert, make sure you have a plan before buying. My plan was crap but I got lucky. I day traded it for a while, I bought it again, it surged, and now I'm going to wait and set a trailing stop in case something bad happens. IDK a proper sell point because this can go anywhere. If it continues to be passed 1 tomorrow and pass 1.20, it will rocket. I will probably buy back because of that crazy long term potential but at around higher .60 to .70, depending on the situation after tomorrow and next week. This plan is my plan, and again I'm not advising anybody. I would like to get advice from you guys, as to whether this stock is worth it, and if my plan is a good one. Please help, contribute, stay honest, and spread good vibes! If this thing goes down, we should sign up for VTGN's clinical trials and get a prescription for it.

""I Want to Do my Own DD, can you give me some sources?"" - Random Guy

Please before you buy this take a look at their website (All the DD you need), and the stimulus checks summary. I posted the links above and below. This will be good DD, but I encourage you to look for further info and share with the sub so we can all stay educated on the stock together.

I have provided quite a bit of info. It's not professional advice, and I'm still learning, but I personally believe this stock is a good one in the short and long term. Let's hope it goes up and celebrate if it does!

&#x200B;

**Optional DD for those having trouble with the info I have presented below:**

\- Long term:üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ - 30 rockets.  I wouldn't even wish that on the worst shorter.

**I do personally believe this thing will leave the solar system and galaxy one day.**

\- Short term: - üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ- 10 rockets, pretty good.

Overall, I hope you enjoyed my DD and sorry if I brought back bad memories of GNUS and all, and sorry if my jokes were lame. But I do think this has potential in the long run and short run. So keep it on your watchlist!!!!!! Have fun trading everybody but at the same time be careful.

Public offering at $0.92.
Note: if you look at the news these investors threw a 100 million dollars at VTGN. I speculate VTGN probably showed them something quite exciting. 100M Is a lot of money..

Edit 3: For those who aren't interested in getting this today, I still think you should keep this on your watchlist when congress approves of the stimulus package, and of course in the long run as their drugs move down the pipeline.

I'm happy it went back to 1.16. Sold it, might return during the day time, or after hours. Long term for sure I'm in. I'm just curious why did this thing bounce back from a panic sell-off, from 0.76 to 1.20.",0.49475693702697754,Positive,English

$TMBR has strong close after hours. The CEO is presenting tomorrow @ 13th Annual LD Micro Conference at 10:40 am est. Expect this stock to run up premarket and drop before the conference starts.

$SNCA volume spiked after hours. Only news I found to justify the move to $0.80‚Äôs. On Sept. 10, 2020 Seneca Biopharma, Inc.

Remember this company received $40 million upfront via equity investment at a premium, with up to $255 million in milestones plus royalty payments. Something is definitely brewing here.

$AAPL ‚Äì Failed to keep support 38.2% on my daily fibo chart, but still on a bullish trend above all the MA 20,50,100 & 200). Waiting for break out this would be the third attempt. If it turns bearish then $115.85. IMO PT $128 by the end of 2020.

2020-11-28,My experience buying put options of companies going bankrupt,"My experience buying put options of companies going bankrupt TLDR: Don‚Äôt do it. 

Quick Background. I am an expert trader who began getting serious with the stonk market after the COVID crash of 2020 and watching The Big Short. I decided that buying puts on everything was the move and all my plays were big brained. 

A little more serious... I bought $1 put options that expire in mid November on JCP (JC Penny if it wasn‚Äôt obvious) since they were surely going to finally die in this economy despite clingy to life by selling men‚Äôs long sleeve shirts that are made for a man 3x the size and family portraits using a camera worse than the IPhone 3. 

As I expected, the stock crashed after they filed for bankruptcy and went below my put and I was IN THE MONEY. But then something happened that I did not see coming... it got delisted. Now I have had other stocks get delisted in my portfolio but never an option. The stock went from JCP to JCPNQ (delisted). This means you can‚Äôt buy any more options but you can sell. However, the price kept going down so I wasn‚Äôt too worried. 

Then expiration came. The stock price was 12 cents and I went to exercise the option and ran into the catch-22. I couldn‚Äôt exercise the option because I couldn‚Äôt but the underlying stock ( can‚Äôt buy delisted stocks on Robinhood if you didn‚Äôt catch that the first time) at market and sell it at the contract price. I tried to sell the option but there was no liquidity in the delisted market. So my option expires in the money and I lost my premium. 

Luckily I didn‚Äôt lose much but hopefully some novice option trader reads this and learns something. 

And before any one says it, yes I know now that buying puts on penny stocks is dumb because your maximum profit is capped.

Currently I‚Äôm sitting on $3, $4.5, $7.5 and $10 calls and have 250 shares averaging at $2.71. My portfolio is up 60% today and I‚Äôm still holding. Reason being is I l believe the stock will hit *at least* $6 before it takes any sort of dive and corrects itself. It‚Äôs last high was $6 in July, and that was before riding around $1 for months. It corrected itself and hovered around $2.60 - $2.40, and now we are experiencing a second run up.

**This run up** is boosted by the even more popular EV hype run we experienced last Summer. Not to mention that the company itself is soon to release the Solo, the *first* vehicle they will have on the market so they will actually have some income coming in. 

**Think the Solo looks stupid?** So do I. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not going to make money off the stock. Even if we think it looks dumb, all the people who have pre ordered it projecting over *two billion dollars* in revenue don‚Äôt care what we think.

1. Bloody string of sessions that have happened followed by a random Green Day today that few can really justify. My theory was a run up to hopeful outstanding ERs by the big ones today. 

2. Mixed bag of reviews by some major players with AAPL being quite a disappointment (although likely impacted by the product release date changes).

3. The hesitation by the market to react more positively to the good PRs (example: AMD acquisition of Xilinx).

4. 0 stimulus currently.

5. Increased Covid cases going into the Fall. (Bonus, vaccine timeline uncertainty)

6. Europe beginning to shut down again.  

7. Election uncertainty.

8. Last Friday before the election.

The cheapest stock I have ever seen.,"Arcos Dorados $ARCO Owns 2200 McDonald's restaurants in 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The cheapest stock I have ever seen. **Update - A few guys did more DD and it appears that the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation has a pretty good position in ARCO, to the tune of over [3 million shares](https://fintel.io/i/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-trust), totaling over $12 million. Obviously these guys see potential in the company.**

**I have 660 September 18, $5 call options. I think this thing can continue rallying into next week. The IV on this options is less than 60. You cannot find that low volatility anywhere for calls these days. And they are trading at 10 cents. I think this stock has the potential to hit $6 in the next week. **

**I know Brazil is a mess and South American in general is a pile of doo doo, but these guys go to McDonald's like it's going out of style. Revenue growth is consistently in the 10% range and last year comps were up 12% for Brazil and over 27% for Southern Latin America. [(Presentation here)](https://www.arcosdorados.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ARCO-KPIs-2Q20.pdf)**

**Also, Bank of America said yesterday that the Brazilian economy has basically returned to pre-covid levels. https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/brazil-economic-activity-returned-to-pre-covid-levels-bofa-says-1.1484251**

**TL;DR - ARCO's McDonald's stores are doing fine and the stock and calls are going up.**


    ---------------------------



A few weeks ago I did some DD on Huttig (HBP). The stock doubled and within a week it received a buyout offer. It was an incredibly undervalued company and it was only a matter of time before the market noticed.

**Today, I bring you another incredibly undervalued company**

Arcos Dorados Holdings (ARCO) is basically McDonalds in Latin America and the Caribbean. They own, operate and sub-franchise all McDonald's restaurants (over 2200) in all of Latin America and the Caribbean. 

**This is a billion dollar company and it is trading like a penny stock at only $4.50. Sales last year were almost $3 billion and the company earned $80 million in net income. EBITDA was almost $300 million. **

**For those who might not know, Arcos Dorados translates to Golden Arches in Spanish.**

Quote directly from the Arcos Dorados (ARCO) [Investor relations page](https://www.arcosdorados.com/ir/company-overview/) 

>""Arcos Dorados is the world‚Äôs largest independent McDonald‚Äôs franchisee, operating the largest quick service restaurant chain in Latin America and the Caribbean. It has the exclusive right to own, operate and grant franchises of McDonald‚Äôs restaurants in 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries and territories with more than 2,200 restaurants, operated by the Company or by its sub-franchisees, that together employ over 100 thousand people""

Coronavirus has negatively impacted sales for the last two quarters, but the sales trends are improving and the stock is still down massively from where it was before the crisis. There is a ton of room for this stock to run higher.

**The catalyst:** The outbreak in Brazil and other LatAm countries is slowing considerably. These economies are starting to re-open. People are starting to line up for Big Macs and cheeseburgers. During the last conference call the company mentioned huge improvement in traffic and sales trends. Another very important point is that the fast food industry in Latin America is highly fragmented with many mom and pop restaurants. These restaurants were power-fucked by pandemic related lock-downs and most of them will never reopen. Arcos Dorados will gobble up all this business and consolidate their hold on the Latin American and Caribbean market. Long term, the pandemic probably is a major boost for the company. 

**The play:** The stock trades at only at $4.50. These shares are on heavy discount. I think the stock should be trading considerably higher and the average Yahoo analyst estimate is $6.10. The September options ($5 strike) are trading at only 10 cents, and the IV for the September calls is under 60, so you are not overpaying for volatility. I think the calls and the shares will increase in value considerably. But still, for safety, I always recommend sticking with common shares when dealing with a penny stock.

*Disclaimer: I'm not pumping this stock, but I can clearly see huge value. I own 25,000 shares, which is a small portion of my portfolio. Do your own due diligence. Remember, the name of the game is to make money. If the stock shoots to $8, remember to bank some profits because nothing is ever 100% certain. But this company is pretty solid. It's a massive operation with over 2200 restaurants. It is not like some biotech company with 5 employees, or a speculative mining play.* **It's freaking the Latin American McDonald's corporation.**",0.0,Neutral,English

2020-07-27,GNUS and the future,"GNUS and the future Alright guys, lets talk about the elephant in the room, GNUS has some of the largest bag holders in the room.

This stock continues to underperform, Its strange however and heres why:

&#x200B;

The company was well over hyped albeit and trapped a bunch of bulls and drove the morale and sentiment down, but lets explore the facts.

&#x200B;

It has some VERY big names tied to it this is an indisputable fact.

The iOS app is actually extremely well done

They have a large SKU count to release in august that will only continue to grow

The current form 14A is to raise the share count to 400million but alot of these shares will not be on the market untill at least September and thats if its voted yes, and even then it was stated that they will be created to purchase or merge others into the business that is supposed to drive the value up again.

They are expecting revenue of 50million this year and 220million next year (Yes i know its forcasted and weathermen are wrong 50% of the time)

ALOT of the stock is held by insiders

They announced the possibilities of dividends on their stock

&#x200B;

So why does everyone still continue to think it is a ""shit"" stock when the company has literally unlimited upside if disney had rolled these catalysts out they would be skyrocketing.... I understand that they are not Disney and have performed poorly in the past. As shareholders or potential shareholders what do you think the correct course of action is for this company to raise the share price and prove that it is a stock worth investing in and holding, when i say investing i mean holding for 1+years

&#x200B;

I will currently be holding this stock as it is worth it for me to lose money here and write it off on my taxes anyways, and if it dips below a dollar I will be tripling my share count.

2020-07-21,NAK - Negative DD,"NAK - Negative DD I posted this as a comment on a thread and thought a couple people here might get something out of it.

The subject was what is negative about NAK. There are a couple hopeful signs as well, but this is focused on the negatives.


--------------------------

There is actually quite a lot of bad stuff about this stock. 95% of the people hyping it are wearing blinders.

Let's start with basic DD. 500 million float is huge, means it will rise slowly relative to the volume. The other thing no one is asking is how did they get so much float? There are a few reasons but the main one is investors have been dropping out for years. That means the reserved stock they had goes into the float. Morgan Stanley was the most recent to drop over 99% of their almost 3.5 million shares.

[Link] (https://fintel.io/so/us/nak/morgan-stanley?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=545bc7023fc4b5066f553824c3a666b4758ebfd9-1595373583-0-AV08lbBMjQfL3KB-rpQCejGlP1tugFzzHqsyNY9DVdxjs7eAg9MxSkyvaUK-c3Mgj-NRjhKhbR6_EVhwPtdx7jYUtt1Xm9UcuXkGqER41XqSAdQcPtHBKF6xFTd4X9HDW97ehK1TkgwprTOzYw2kOPoXzh1Ls-4jUe-QYauzhmdkqlTZKixuNHSF0hn8UBpAx7dKAriClhcri-rOqipnu2go0n2oDCfGy-LyjbMpJ2mGlKjj9d3IHRnONxObh5oeCU3Wja3d-KVqFXjIqSOWUHwn7mCX2HOtC6wQF7a8kpCRFBe_vIQqWjOzkjyVSdohQgtYqiebifC9xbnI83kW66G2wGMjt88eDBqVqCBWt3g9)

In addition the other thing people are saying is once the decision is reached, someone will buy them out and start mining. That is nowhere close to the truth.

The fact is, while the news this Friday is important, it's a small step. The  Army corps will likely allow  with restrictions the project to continue. The question is what are the restrictions? We may not know until 30 days after next Friday. That's when the Record of Decision may be released.

The next fun thing is the EPA could veto the entire thing if their concerns aren't met. Please see this [Letter] (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-05/documents/bristol-bay-404q-supplemental-comments-5-28-2020.pdf/) to see why.

Alright, now assuming all that goes according to plan, now they have to get approval from the state of Alaska. While there is support by the government, the locals are not happy. 80% of locals [oppose] (http://www.utbb.org/s/2018-UTBB-Pebble-Survey-Final-Results.pdf) it and 60% of Alaskans [oppose] (https://stoppebbleminenow.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BBDF_PollingMemo.pdf) it. In fact NAK tried to bribe the locals and they still [rejected it] (https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/BBNC-unanimously-rejects-offer-from-Pebble-Partnership-to-join-in-revenue-sharing-570803031.html)

Which leads me to my next point. Partnership/buyout. I can not find the link to this next points as I forgot the keywords I used, take it or leave it. Apparently Pebble has been trying to find a partner for a long time. However due to the opposition they have been declined possibly many times. I am also fairly sure if they had a partnership or buyout NAK wouldn't have any problem announcing that.

The last thing I want to address is despite the CEO saying they can get everything done before Trump leaves office next Jan, Biden can still halt almost everything or at least delay it as Pebble still needs over 60 licenses!

https://investorplace.com/2020/07/nokia-stock-has-120-upside-after-u-k-bans-huawei-5g/

The UK just banned all Huawei 5G, and anti-Huawei sentiment is spreading. For months now, the U.S. government has warned its allies about Huawei, a Chinese state-owned telecom provider with strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Their concern may be well-placed. Why? Chinese companies have a long history of illegally collecting data. Essentially, Western governments are starting to lock out Huawei along with Chinese-owned¬†ZTE.

Then who, may I ask, will take its place? Its two remaining western competitors: Ericsson and Nokia. In particular, investors should look at Nokia.

Nokia is a top 5G provider. Gone are the days of them hocking cell phones. When people ask ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt the U.S. have 5G players of its own?‚Äù The answer: Nokia acquired it all. Today, Nokia makes some of the best small-cell 5G towers. The extra towers needed for 5G networks also means Nokia will earn more from maintaining networks and providing the sophisticated software that runs it.

And all of this is just ONE star of many that are starting to align for Nokia to be the big man on campus. 

https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/14/nokia-5g-software-can-upgrade-5-million-4g-tower-radios-without-climbs/

Nokia¬†released an alternative that will help carriers rapidly convert 4G infrastructure to 5G: a software update that can convert 5 million existing 4G tower radios to 5G without the need for tower climbs or site revisits.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/25/huawei-loses-out-to-nokia-ericsson-in-building-singapores-main-5g-networks.html

The tide and sentiment towards Huawei is shifting away.

The 5G evolution and sector as a whole is accelerating. Don't get left behind.

(Lately it's been more of the latter) I exclusively use it on PC because smartphones are big gay... The phone number that is linked to the account is out of service.

Now for the 'interesting' bits.. I have 2FA turned off because I'm an old fashioned guy, I think a password should be all it takes to log in to an account, there shouldn't be a bunch of extra steps. Robinhood seems to think the opposite, and forcibly so.. I can't change my phone number to my current one due to the ""verify your identity"" prompt, which is basically 2FA without calling it 2FA. In the help center, it states - 
""You can change your phone number on Robinhood as long as you have access to the email address associated with your account.""
This is just completely untrue.. It does give you the option to verify by email or text, but clicking the email button just tells you email codes are no longer supported and you have to use the SMS method. Aggravating, isn't it?
My address and phone number are out of date on RH, and I'm just sitting here hoping and praying my browser doesn't crash or I don't drunkenly leave my lappy off the charger one night until I can resolve this, because I'd be indefinitely locked out of my account and with my luck I'd come back to see my portfolio value cut right in two..

Well, it seems Robinhood thinks asking people who've been hacked if they'd signed up with unofficial 3rd party services, what email service provider they use, or if the password the used back then (and would have obviously changed by now) was weak is a bad idea. So bad that they [sent me this email at 10:50 last night](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/307500722377850880/764131472050356224/Screenshot_20201009-102502.jpg) to take it down. My account hasn't been cracked so who knows what they'd want to talk to me about. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

And besides, I've been down that road once... when I noticed people reporting their referral shares weren't being given to them when they stood next to the person and watched as their friend clicked their link, I communicated with Robinhood privately for days about it; describing what I've read from others and observed through my own research (including how the different subdomains for referral links [join.*, share.*, and referral.*] all behaved very differently even depending on what browser you used, if your friend had the app installed already, etc...) and got nowhere. They told me everything works as designed despite people still missing referrals almost a year later (reported [two](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j2we52/robin_hood_not_giving_my_free_stocks_for_referrals/) [times](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j6x0j5/very_disappointed_with_robinhood_referral_and/) in the last week!). I may be in a position to notice when issues become a trending problem and raise a red flag but I cannot be the go-between for a company with fully staffed legal, support, and social media teams and their own end users. I'm not wasting my time like that again.

...but it seems like I have wasted my time on this:

# What I Know

Unless you're on Discord, you might not be aware so here's a rundown: accounts are being broken into, assets sold off, and cash spent in lump sums with the Cash Management debit cards. It's happening every day. It's been happening for months.

The attack seems to play out this way:

 - first, the target's email account is breached
 - the cracker deletes all email from Robinhood from the user's inbox
 - the cracker initiates a password reset and intercepts the email [[*](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/hu380w/robinhood_password_reset_code_without_asking/)]
   - if 2FA is enabled, Robinhood requires it be disabled before changing the password [[reportedly](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/catiu7/robinhood_doesnt_let_you_change_your_password/); dead end?]
    - if 2FA is disabled, the cracker simply clicks the link in the email and completes the process
 - the cracker attempts to log into the user's Robinhood account with the new password
   - if 2FA was enabled with SMS, the code is sent to the user's phone which the cracker doesn't have access to [roadblock but not a dead end]
   - if 2FA was enabled with an app, the code is generated with a key which the cracker doesn't have access to [dead end]
   - if 2FA was **not** enabled, a six digit code is sent to the user's phone first and then allows the cracker to send it to the email address
 - equity positions are closed (sold with market orders; I've yet to see a report about crypto being sold off or options positions closed)
 - even if the user is locked out (this isn't always the case which I have not figured out yet), the app is still subscribed to push notifications and they're able to watch all their shares being sold off
 - if the user does not have Cash Management enabled on their account, the cracker enables it on their behalf
 - all cash is 'spent' with the Cash Management debit card in one or two transactions typically through a service called Revolut

The timeline between when the email account is under their control and when they start messing with a user's Robinhood account here is unclear but it seems to happen over night or early morning in the US. People wake up to several codes sent to them via SMS when this fails.

# What I Am Trying to Sort Out

What I still do not know is if Robinhood accounts are being targeted and how. A little over 5% of Robinhood's 13+ million account holders subscribe to /r/Robinhood and posts about being hacked this way come in at least once a day; [1](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j79rzw/debit_card_fraud_in_cash_management/), [2](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j6ikvz/warning_robinhood_hackers/), [3](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j5ij5o/robinhood_account_hack_stressful/), [4](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j437k2/frustration_with_robinhood/), [5](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j3i6cx/robinhood_opened_a_cash_account_and_sold_a_bunch/), [6](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j3ab4y/someone_please_hold_me_account_hacked/), [7](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j2bmct/robinhood_hacked_all_stocks_were_sold_and_2_large/), [8](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j24zgi/robinhood_account_hacked_and_recovered/), [9](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/izw4ui/account_hack_my_account_is_been_hack_no_answer/), [10](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/izqizv/account_hacked_now_what/), [11](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/izghzi/i_recently_had_someone_break_into_my_account_4/), [12](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/iybbir/my_account_hack_money_gone_using_robinhood_debit/), [13](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/iy0mqf/hack_money_gone_no_answer/), [14](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/ixth2n/my_account_was_hack_someone_sold_all_my_positions/), [15](https://reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/ixsgbi/turn_on_the_twofactor_authentication/) in a quick scan of misdirected support requests over the last two weeks (I know these all say [removed]; I generally do not approve posts with account issues that can only be resolved by Robinhood but, if anyone requests it, I'll approve any of these that do not contain account information). That's crazy high when you figure 99.9% of people would know to contact Robinhood support when they have problems with their account rather than show up in a random subreddit that was started for a cartoon fox. If the number of reports here scales up to their entire user base, that's dozens of accounts broken into every day.

# What I (Am Forced To) Assume

Without being able to ask anyone affected anymore, I'm forced to speculate on a few major points:

 - Somehow, Robinhood accounts are being targeted.

  True, my sample size is small but it's incredibly improbable that random dictionary attacks on random email addresses would have this level of success. I do not believe there's been a leak of customer info (I still feel it's a 3rd party app or service users have signed up with using the same email address) ...but if you had every active US-ish (.com, .edu. etc.) email address in existence on slips of paper in a giant hat, it would take you years to pull out one of the addresses attached to a funded/active Robinhood account. Somehow, the list of target addresses is being narrowed down.

  If I could figure this one bullet point out, I think we as end-users could keep ourselves and help each other stay secure.
 - Variations of this have been happening since the pandemic began and is growing now that the cracker(s) are using Revolut.
 - Sutton, Robinhood's card issuer, has decided not to or at least has not been diligent in blacklisting obvious paths for fraud and theft.
 - Robinhood is taking the hit on making people whole when it happens. Some have even reported Robinhood restoring old positions again for them.

# Revolut

[According to their Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolut), Revolut is a London based fintech startup originally funded in HK by Kremlin backed billionaire [Yuri Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Milner). They provide commission-free trading with hard limits (3 trades a month?) on top of their basic transaction services. Just looking at their expansion around the world is insane for a company this young. Have fun jumping down that rabbit hole.

Anyway, the draw for this sort of fraud to pass through them is that they seem to allow people to use [*any* debit or credit card to fund their account by treating it as a POS transaction](https://thehftguy.com/2020/08/12/a-haven-for-fraud-and-stolen-cards-or-how-my-wife-was-forced-to-quit-revolut/).

# ...what now?

I strongly suggest we all rethink our own online security. This is not an exhaustive list but here goes...

 - Enable [**app-based** 2FA as suggested by Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/twofactor-authentication/); Robinhood (and most other services) will give you the option to send codes via email as a backup to SMS-based 2FA (as a convenience in case you've lost your phone, etc.) which **is not secure if someone has access to your email account**.
 - Store your backup codes in a secure way.
 - Use a second or third or fourth email address for anything 'important.' These addresses should be kept absolutely private and never used to sign up for any social media, etc.
 - Keep an eye out for missing correspondence with Robinhood support, order confirmations, statement notices, etc.
 - Make the concept of using strong passwords everywhere a facet of your personality. Breathe it into your lungs like air. Make it a part of you. Before you meet up, you should discuss limits, test status, drug use, and password strength with Tinder matches.

recovered my yahoo email

checked my phone and saw No service; fuck !

Fortunately local t-mobile store was opened; went there and after 3 hours got my number back and created a incident report

came home checked my yahoo email; sent folders - no spam; deleted folder - couple of emails about changing password to robinhood

tried to logon to robinhood - could not

waited for 2 days no response

created another account for me with different email; contacted robinhood again online as well as twitter [@AskRobinhood](https://twitter.com/AskRobinhood)

got response within 8 hours; someone from robinhood called me over phone and validated my personal info; got access back to the account - but robinood locked it for security

found the hacker sold my stocks and asked for debit card; robinhood told me they will take care and recover my stocks and work with law enforcement to investigage

2020-09-10,"-$27,746.51 because of TSLA debit spread","-$27,746.51 because of TSLA debit spread UPDATE: One of RH's brokers contacted me via phone call and told me why my balance is negative and how it happened (Basically word by word what Michael Burry Scott said in comments). He also stated vaguely that they request the money to be paid back ASAP; he did not give a time frame nor a minimum amount. He seemed very friendly and was willing to explain and hear me out (before the phone call was cut short...) I want to remind everyone to **PLEASE BE CAREFUL!!**

I owe RH cause my 5 contracts of $411/$412 Call 9/4 was exercised on 9/4 after hours at 9:13pm, but the short leg didn't close until next market day. Basically, I was forced to buy 500 shares at $411 ($205,500), RH didn't exercise the short position until Tuesday when TSLA dropped to $355 ($177,753.49).

Difference: $27,746.51.

TSLA on 9/4 closed at $418, which is ITM, so I technically was at profit, but the stock dipped after hours. So I guess RH's ""risk checks designed to close positions which accounts cannot support"" couldn't process what happened.

EDIT: I realize and understand that me losing this large sum is solely my fault and not Robinhood. I should have closed the spread before market close and I can't do anything but stop gambling in the market and make back money in other, safer ways.",0.0,Neutral,English

2020-08-07,Confessions from my First 3 Years of (Failed) Trading,"Confessions from my First 3 Years of (Failed) Trading First off, not sure if this type of post is allowed here to just hoping for the best. Thanks for reading if you decide to. I just want to get some frustrations off my chest, and feel like writing it down will help me move on. To preface, I am turning 30 this year to help put all of these numbers in perspective.

I started trading stocks in early 2017. I deposited $5,000 into my account and looked at all my possibilities. Being a gamer, naturally my watch list included the likes of Nvidia, AMD, INTC, ATVI, EA and what else was I familiar with? Tech, so it also included the likes of FB, APPL, NFLX, etc. At this point you get the picture. So now you're probably saying to yourself, almost every single one of these stocks has rocketed since 2017, did I misread his title? No, you didn't. This is where my stupidity takes over. 

Although I only started with a $5,000 deposit, I've held a well paying desk job since 2017. By no means am I struggling financially, which ultimately was my downfall for trading. Since I had a well paying job, but no capital going into trading, my mentality was all wrong. I thought I had to go for life changing money instead of the 'safe' bets. My thought was, 5-10% a year wasn't going to pay off my student debt, buy a car, nor put a large down payment on a home and theoretically if I lost it all, I would still be financially stable. Enter penny stocks... I took out all my money in the companies that I knew well, and started researching risky penny plays. Montage time: my timing is always off; I chase the profits; I sell out of fear; the nagging of hindsight eats away at every trade I make; I play swings and then miss the big jump. I make every mistake in the book and refuse to learn from them. Stupid decision after stupid decision. Ultimately, I decided to hold onto bags instead of moving to the stable opportunities staring me in the face. Fast forward 3 years later, I have been able to add a total of $70k in cash to my portfolio, but am currently sitting at a market value of $43k. Obviously this isn't terrible, but when considering the market as a whole since 2017, it has been a huge failure. I am finally done, I tried and failed to 'make it big'. 

I am currently researching more stable plays and debating if I missed the boat on all the tech stocks I was watching in the beginning.

If you want to know more specifics I would be happy to provide but knew this was getting long already. Also before you jump to attack me, I know my balance (and more importantly my job) is still very lucky to have at all in the current state of the world. I am thankful for what I have but I let greed get the better of me for far too long. Hopefully I can stop squandering what I have now.",0.0,Neutral,English

All robinhood says is once you reach 25k you can make unlimited day trades.      Yesterday I tried to just follow Twitter and other stock chat room alerts from people I‚Äôve learned to trust the last couple months.   Every time my phone alerted me, I‚Äôd throw 500-2000 at the stock as quick as I could and would ride it a few cents and get out.   Most of these I was in and out in under a few mins. I tracked it all on a spreadsheet and I made around 30 day trades yesterday.   It was really profitable.     I fully understand the risks of doing this and it‚Äôs not going to work like that every day, but I‚Äôm wondering about other risks.  

I read something on the Finra website last night about day trade buying power being 4X what you closed with the day before.    How do I see how much of that I‚Äôve used up in robinhood during the day.  

Also let‚Äôs say I closed at 25,000.  According to Finra my day trade buying power is 100k.  If I buy 25,000 worth of a stock and then sell it for 25,000 an hour later, did I just use 25,000 or 50,000 of that buying power?     Also with settlement times, can I trade up to that 100,000 every single day?    

Sounds like they could issue a margin call if I trade too much but I don‚Äôt know how to find where I‚Äôm trading too much.     Any advice would be appreciated,

With COVID-19 forcing many companies to take their foot off the pedal, for Tesla, it was merely a speed bump towards becoming one of the [biggest auto manufacturers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-tesla/teslas-market-value-zooms-past-that-of-gm-and-ford-combined-idUSKBN1Z72MU) on the planet. 

With this in mind, I don't think there will ever be a ""quiet"" time to look at Tesla. Let's charge up and drive through some fundamentals.

**How Does Tesla Make Money?**

I'll skip over the usual ""who and what is Tesla?"" because, even with stay-at-home orders and a global lockdown, nobody has time to pick through that essay.

Let's focus on how Tesla makes money to help us understand what the business is focusing on and why.

Broadly speaking the business is split into three areas, selling cars (and leasing them), selling solar power and batteries for storing electricity, and supporting businesses such as selling power to charge your Tesla (charging stations.)

Tesla is best known for their cars, their market strategy is a simple one. Start by building high-end luxury vehicles which are limited in supply. Reinvest these gains into building vehicles targetting more of the mass market at a lower price point, and keep repeating. The result being everyone owns a Telsa at any price point while retaining that original luxury image. Currently, this has been the case, with Tesla's regarded as a luxury manufacturer even when compared to direct competitor products. 

Having a strategy is nothing without execution, and right now the limiting factor is manufacturing capabilities.

While this helps the luxury aspects of the brand due to the limited supply, this has not been intentional. 

Limited production also means the additional services will also suffer. Charging stations are not exclusive to Tesla vehicles but with many manufacturers partnering with suppliers and charging ports directly, there is less of an opportunity here versus running a petrol station. There are additional streams such as the fully self-driving car upgrades, and ongoing costs associated with the in-vehicle features, all of which require you to own a Tesla in the begin. Expect this revenue line to follow the main auto manufacturing line item.

The last item to cover is the energy generation and storage side of the business. Taking a page out of Amazon's book, if you have an internal solution is that a viable business in its own right? Tesla's efforts to expand its battery technology led them on a journey to acquiring a solar company (SolarCity.) Now able to offer a complete charging and storage solution, or split individually to both end consumers and even government bodies alike. 

**What About Tesla's Fundamentals?**

There is a lot to cover when it comes to Tesla, I'll try and keep us focused (for your sake and mine) as this write up should serve as the appetiser and not replace your due diligence. Plus, [reading the last 10-Q](https://ir.tesla.com/node/20666/html) I spent as long reading about lawsuits versus how they make their revenue.

Unsurprisingly Tesla is very expensive and seems to follow the trend of a technology company rather than any manufacturing company. Even the future momentum is lower than you would expect, largely due to the recent rally passing sell-side analyst expectations. What you might be shocked to see is the relatively poor condition of Tesla's finances. We know Tesla has had a few close calls when it comes to bankruptcy and their aggressive growth as resulted in no single year being profitable.

With that in mind let's dig into the raw details to find out what these ranks mean to us.

&#x200B;

With the last three quarters showing a positive profit margin, the COVID-19 lockdown has been a very painful shock for Tesla, what should have been a successful Q2 2020 is likely to be a slip back into negative profit margins again. One question to ask, how negative is a negative profit margin?

Last four quarters Tesla has made $26bn. While it beats Ford's $0.3bn, it is nothing compared to BMW's $117bn. However, revenue is a meaningless figure on its own. We need to break down the cost of revenue.

For the full financial year of 2019, Telsa has a pitiful gross margin of 16.56%, which is then reduced again but all the additional costs bringing us to a -3.51% profit margin. This reduction isn't as much as I expected. The extra expenses are heavier on general admin than R&D which isn't what I expected to see. This does mean Tesla has additional money it can access in a pinch, though you can argue that will cost them in terms of long term competitive advantage. 

While Tesla is busy opening up new sites and investing heavily into the build quality these are headway expenses that will hopefully reduce with scale.

While an odd example this is the kind of focus Tesla are trying to bring into the business, optimising their existing processes. Reducing their costs to increase the margins, while making the process simpler.

A bit part of Tesla is their debt, which is eating away around $170m each quarter in interest payments. 

&#x200B;

Source: [Tesla Q1 2020 10-Q](https://ir.tesla.com/node/20666/html)

In terms of short term (due this year) liabilities Tesla owe $11.98bn, oddly it's the payments to their suppliers which is the highest contributor to this (barely.) Long term Tesla has $13.9bn which will be due in the future. Given accounts payable made up a third of this year's debt, debt wasn't as big of an issue as I expected. The debt to assets last quarter was 71.19%, while high it is still very manageable. 

I was fairly surprised to see Tesla has been building up a war chest, last quarter they had $8bn in cash. In terms of Tesla assets, the manufacturing sites make up the bulk, sitting at a cool $20bn.

The last six months for Tesla has represented some incredible growth. Even now Tesla is up again by almost 4% following a bullish analyst claiming the Q2 numbers can be beaten.

As an investor, Tesla is a tech stock, meaning extremely high valuations. The negative profit margin saves Tesla from the shame of meaningful P/E ratio. However, we can always see what kind of premium we are paying by looking at the book to price, 26.90x. Even the cash to share ratio is an unpleasant 36.94x.

To justify these ratios, Tesla must have some strong backing by the sell-side analysts.

As I keep saying, this is not the case. It's rare to see such a hotly disputed stock. We are seeing analysts shift from hold to both buy and sell. While analysts are extremely hopeful with future EPS and Revenue figures, the target price is the topic of many debates.

The current target price (taking the average of 32 analysts!) is negative compared to where we are right now. The current price is higher than that screenshot says, by a solid $80 a share.

**Are The Fundamentals Meaningless For Tesla?**

Fundamentals are a tool in your belt, it has a time a place and you use it to help you make decisions. Maybe the last bit didn't make too much sense, you don't ask the hammer before you cut wood but you get the point.

The fundamentals are showing a business which is slowly increasing its margins but scaling. Each new factory, each new mass-market vehicle, it all brings us closer to Tesla's ultimate goal.

The debt is more under control than I first assumed, their long term debt is aggressively priced with a few 7% bonds in there, these could do with some refinancing. Surprisingly Tesla has been doing a good job of keeping money in its own pockets, while still pumping out an alarming amount of new vehicles. 

**Summary Pros**

* Arguably one of the cutting edge auto-manufacturer if not the manufacturer they can be a provider into another eco-system
* The vertical integration and in-house nature works at scale, something they are starting to achieve
* New sites opening up, the growing Chinese market being a prime target
* Cult following similar to Apple in terms of brand loyalty and high levels of advocacy
* Leasing is high margin and helps drive the fully autonomous vehicle research, a potentially large revenue stream if achieved with the right partners

**Summary Cons**

* Extremely overpriced, even account for their growth, the next three years feels very comfortably priced in
* Emotionally linked to Elon Musk, for better or worse and I'd put this down as a con as much as a pro
* A constant struggle to hit a year of profitability is resulting in higher financing which keeps slowing Tesla down
* Big brands like BWM are innovating at the same speed and make for extremely tough competition

**My Thoughts?**

The cult of Elon gives and takes. The passion that drives Tesla can not be ignored. If the next model of Tesla vehicle requires a new alloy to be created, few companies could be capable of such a task and yet this always feels within Teslas reach. Making the impossible seem like business as usual is something Tesla does with incredible ease.

There are very substantial and real threats to Tesla and a lot of spinning plates. It's easy for Tesla to be distracted and lose sight of the big picture, but that is also the charm of the business. The same way Steve Jobs pushed to reduce the size of his phones, the small details create something greater than their parts.

I currently have less than 5% of my portfolio exposed to Tesla (indirect through an investment trust) and it's something I am comfortable with.

A bet on Tesla is not a fundamental decision, it's a decision on what I want tomorrow to look like. Few companies offer services today while looking to build tomorrow the way Tesla does. This is the kind of innovation that drags the world kicking and screaming with it. 

I don't know if Tesla will ""win"" the electric vehicle race, but I do know our world is better for having Tesla in it.

Let me know what you think, is Tesla something you are watching? Are you on the fence like the analysts or do you have a strong view?

While looking through the sector NextEra stood out as been unique with a story behind them.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/okenftwkjh451.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f5c05962cb4e50917b88b412ec047ee7148aee

**Who Are NextEra?**

This is a trickier question than normal. If you search and try and invest in NextEra you'll see there are two companies with a similar name, and similar logo. They have a link but they are two independent firms.

NextEra Energy (NEE), who I want to talk about today, owns two electric companies. Florida Power & Light Company serves more than five million customers. This makes them the biggest regulated electric utility provider in the USA! Measured by retail only that is. The second company is Gulf Power Company which operates in eight counties, serving 460 thousand customers. Finally, NextEra Energy also is an energy company in its own right and is the largest generator of renewable energy from wind and sun! As well as being in the battery storage game as well. 

Hopefully, like me, this has got your attention as to what they can become and how they can expand.

The other company, NextEra Energy Partners (NEP), is a partnership between itself and NextEra Energy. This separate company focuses on acquiring, managing, and owning clean energy projects and sites for the long term. This means that NextEra Energy can build a new site, get the technology and set up in place, secure a long term energy contract, then sell the whole project to NextEra Energy Partners for instant cash or to aid with cash flow. It does mean NextEra Energy Partners can also create partnerships on projects with multiple businesses and manage them separately from NextEra Energy directly.

While both companies you can invest in, depending on what kinds of exposures you like, I will focus in on NextEra Energy as that is where the R&D and energy generation are happening, rather than going through the partners' route.

**What Does NextEra Do?**

I should start by saying this ""clean energy"" company is not exclusively green. Gulf Power Company is not exclusively green. If we look at the different business lines when it comes to the revenue we get a clearer picture of what NextEra truly does. As this is the combination of multiple companies and different partnerships what they do runs a lot deeper than their company statement.

The last annual report doesn't include a clean here is where our money comes from across all our businesses, meaning we have to mash this data together ourselves to figure out what they truly do.

FPL relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities, some facilities can operate on both natural gas and oil, and on purchased power to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more economical fuel mix. This is the strategy here for making Florida Power more ""eco"".

NEER sells products associated with its generation facilities (energy, capacity, renewable energy credits (RECs) and ancillary services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located. They have a broader remit and get involved in infrastructure and transmission across the US. 

Gulf Power was finally acquired and moved over at the start of 2019. This isn't an eco company at all, and they are working to transition this business to move over to renewables.

As mentioned, this is the oddest ""renewable"" energy company I've come across, because they don't appear to be that renewable. It's a sprawling US-focused energy company with a heavy preference for renewable wind and solar, but that doesn't limit them.

In terms of how NextEra generates its power, you can expect it to come from a mix of solar, wind, natural gas, coal, nuclear, and oil. However, they have some additional revenue lines, as NextEra is in the business of selling the electricity they also have a trading division. Meaning they not only sell directly to end retail consumers (a few institutional contracts as well) but they also squeeze the margins but using a mix of buying in energy cheaply while also selling their excess. This level of operations is only possible with the scale of NextEra and their scope as an overall business.

**Does NextEra Make Money?**

Is this a profitable business, the energy sector can be tough, and anyone chasing the renewable energy industry, in particular, can end up being cash burning and supported only by grants and green bonds.

&#x200B;

Source: [Genuine Impact](https://www.genuineimpact.io/)

A first glance comparing NextEra against the market doesn't look very promising. I want to know more than just a market comparison though, I want to see the actual numbers past and present. We know they have been acquiring new businesses, and they have a busy pipeline of reinvestment into their new sites, what does that mean for the profitability.

To start us off, NextEra generated $19.2bn in revenue in 2019, $4.6bn in the first quarter of 2020 as well. It's great to bring in money, but how are they converting this? Back to the annual statements for this. NextEra is running a gross margin of 58.33%, which represents a high cost of revenue. For the energy sector, and renewables especially, this is pretty strong, this isn't a number I expected to be above 30-40%. Recently I looked at a solar company who's gross margin was negative, so this is a relief. 

Energy companies also love to reinvest into R&D, and in this case, as we are selling directly to customers we can expect a higher than normal marketing budget. I was very impressed to see a very comfortable 19.63% profit margin. In 2018 this was 39.68% but we had less investment and financing activity that year.

So far this mutt of an energy company is showing the right signals, the next pitfall is the debt. With expensive sites and fixed long term contracts, the assets can be extremely high, which tends to encourage borrowing beyond their means. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pp5usexakh451.jpg?width=1386&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5c99855628da07a43392e7c552b54c2f79aafed

Source: [Wallmine](https://gb.wallmine.com/nyse/nee)

For me, this is another tick mark. Even with $117.7bn in assets, the debt to assets is a comfortable 64.86%. Looking at the near term (back to quarterly statements!) The current liabilities are sitting at $13.7bn, but we have a problem. The current assets (cash, net receivables, and inventory) are only worth $9.7bn. Given the operational income for the most recent 2020 quarter was only $1.98bn we have a shortfall to think about.

The quarterly interest expense has shot up recently as NextEra takes on more financing. $1.3bn came out in Q1 2020, compared to $0.2bn in Q4 2019 and $0.7bn Q3 2019. While the long term picture isn't anything to panic about, this short term increasing debt while they are seeing the economy come under pressure is an unwelcome situation.

There is one last aspect of the financials I want to look into. How can I as an investor make money? Thankfully we have a dividend to look at. Due to the recent share price dive, and the darkening financial situation in the short term the dividend yield is a very weak 2.06%.

That 2% yield, however, represents a 73% payout ratio. Meaning if we can see increasing dividend growth and have confidence in the recovery, then there is a lot of long term love to be found here.

&#x200B;

It's not often you come across a company with dividend growth for 24 years with no breaks. A quarterly dividend, with a strong track record, creates a lot of pressure on management to protect this for shareholders. The negative is this can cause short term decisions to create a booster quarter for shareholders and passing the issues onto the next quarter. 

The historic growth plus a fairly stable management team gives me the impression passing the buck onto the coming quarter is not something they do (commonly enough to be an issue at least!)

**Is NextEra Cheap To Buy?**

No. I don't think this will come as a surprise. For the most part, they have a solid balance sheet, they have a strong history, while the company is structured in a way that means you need six Bloomberg screens just to find a single revenue line, it's not new knowledge that NextEra exists and the market has been watching.

&#x200B;

We have the classic COVID-19 dip we have seen across the market, however, the recovery hasn't been as strong as other companies even within the energy sector.

With the retail focus leaning heavily on their balance sheet, and Americans faced with a lot of economic issues in the immediate term, investors have reassessed the price a bit more cautiously.

Even now we can see a P/E ratio of 34.21x, price to sales of 6.46x, and a price to book of 3.45x. In the defence of NextEra, we do have a book to share ratio of 72.10x, however, this is not uncommon when you have assets that are functional sites that are bundled with long term energy contracts. 

Some other interesting facts which might explain why some investors have taken a moment to raise their eyebrows is internal ownership. Only 0.18% of the shares are held by directors and the institutional ownership sits at 81.04%. Remember that complex structure? NextEra Energy Partners owns the lions share here. 

NextEra Energy is selling a lot of directors sells recently but if you peek at  NextEra Energy Partners you'll see similar directors all buying. While the timings are off, and I expect some are locking in some profits, the heavy sell activity is only telling part of the story due to the company structure. That said this confusing relationship and setup will be offputting against other investments where ownership and responsibility is a bit more clear cut.

**What Does The Future Hold For NextEra?**

As my crystal ball has been broken for some time now, and I'm pretty sure it was defective anyway (thanks Beyond Meat) I'll have to depend on the far more educated professional sell-side analysts.

In terms of the future share price growth, the average prediction for the coming year is a $10\~ per share increase, a 3.23% increase. If you are a big-time momentum hunter there are much more volatile and high growth energy firms out there. The dividend will be causing a drag on the share price. The long term plan is the regular and reliable dividend payments than selling off at peaks.

The other aspect to consider is the revenue and EPS predictions, which are both pretty punchy for NextEra. Looking at the annual statements again, NextEra has a pretty rubbish record of beating expectations, they come very close but have trouble sealing the deal. 

With a poor track record of meeting analyst expectations and slow growth, is the dividend and green future enough to secure your interest?

According to the analysts, it should be! With 18 analysts keeping tabs on what is happening at NextEra (and no doubt fighting the company structure to come up with any conclusion) they are leaning towards a buy. Currently, we are in the overweight zone in terms of sentiment, which is an encouraging future if you are looking for a longer-term investment.

**NextEra Energy Executive Summary**

* A strong balance sheet with big revenues and excellent profitability
* Watch out for the short term this year debt, we might have some problems in the near term due to financing and COVID-19
* The dividend has grown for over 20 years, pays quarterly and over 70% of the income is being paid out
* This is expensive to buy right now as it's not an unknown stock and the short term debt means it might get cheaper short term
* Analysts are liking what they see, share price growth is barely beating inflation but the dividend is the crown jewel here
* Not strictly ""green energy"" but a bit part of their business, if you want pure renewables you'll have to skip NextEra for now

Thanks for reading! I hope you have enjoyed learning about NextEra as much as I've enjoyed writing and researching them.

Please let me know your thoughts, is NextEra something you are interested in or are there other energy firms you prefer? I've tried changing up how I've written this. If you prefer a different style let me know!

**What Does Trade Desk Do?**

The Trade Desk is a company which helps advertisers get more for their money. By using proprietary data, brands can use a fully automated, or programmatic means, to purchase advertising on various media to find consumers that fit.

If you have never heard of programmatic advertising, the example you will know (and maybe not love) is Google and Facebook advertising. These are both examples of programmatic adverts. You see ads based on real-time data, your demographic, current trends, budgets, time of day, and even based on your local weather. These ads launch in seconds can be turned off at any point in time, and most importantly, are measurable.

Programmatic advertising came into its own after the 2008 recession when companies suddenly had to prove how they use their advertising budgets and what works. Data led advertising has been disrupted over 10 years ago, and we are very much looking at the decline at ""spray-and-pray"" advertising, traditional TV ads which can't be measured or interacted with, static billboards, even your regular poster pinups. 

&#x200B;

Source: [Smart Insights](https://www.smartinsights.com/internet-advertising/internet-advertising-targeting/what-is-programmatic-marketing/)

Trade Desk came to live in 2009, and they still have the founder running the business. They saw early opportunities for a data lead advertising platform. Their solution allows for programmatic ads across a range of mediums, they integrate into the likes of Google, Facebook, TikTok, even Connected TV (CTV is streaming with ads.) As a customer, you use Trade Desk to set up your target customers, how you want to reach them, dynamic define budgets and create a single advertising experience across multiple channels. In return, Trade Desk takes a cut of the fees paid. The key is volume. The more ads you run, the more people that see it, the more targetted your adverts the price increases. 

This isn't a typical advertising company where you score a handful of massive long term contracts. They need volume and engagement. Advertisers can very easily get started, but just as easily stop. This is the double edge sword of programmatic advertising.

With offices in various cities in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia, Trade Desk considers themselves a technology company that empowers buyers of advertising. They offer a self-service cloud-based platform where customers (buyers) can create, manage, and optimize data-driven digital advertising campaigns across ad formats, including display, video, audio, native and, social, on a multitude of devices, such as computers, mobile devices, and connected TV. A whole lot of tech powering your complete digital advertising strategy with less staff. You can see why this is such an attractive proposition to their customers. If traditional TV ads require signed agreements months in advance and offer no measurement or data feedback, you can see the appeal.

**What Do The Fundamentals Tell Us?**

While doing some research into Trade Desk I spent some time reading their prepared statements, and quarterly reports. One aspect of the business stood out to me. They value above all else, self-sustainability, which directly relates to keeping the company cash-rich and resistant.

It's always good to see intent translating into fact. From a relative perspective, Trade Desk is in the top 20% of companies in terms of their financial strength, but are extremely expensive, and have weak future growth. Let's dive into the raw number to better understand why this is, and what this means as an investment.

It's worth noting the company has been hit hard by COVID-19. While they opened the year on a high (33% ahead) this quickly dried up as all advertisers pulled their budgets. Some customers completely stopping all expense, while others moved to a light brand presence rather than a promotional stance. This meant April has some horrific numbers to report, while it stabilised and is slowly coming back, their business is at a low right now.

From a revenue standpoint, we have seen a quarter on quarter reliable increase. COVID-19 means the last reported quarter and likely the next we will see a decrease in their revenue figures.

Taking a step back to the annual figures, Trade Desk claim their biggest strength is their financial position. With a profit margin of 16.39%, this isn't the most impressive in the market and it highlights some big R&D tech spending. While they might sit in the advertising space they are truly a tech investment. Like most tech investments they pour money into R&D to keep their competitive edge. Such heavy investment into innovation and staying ahead, as well as big spending on marketing, it's very fair to say Trade Desk doesn't have a defensible moat in the sense they could ease their additional spending and retain their position. While customer churn might impressive, this could be disrupted by newer more operational efficient entries. 

What did impress me was the debt management. The last few technology companies were drowning in debt. Trade Desk has drawn down $143m under their credit facility as a precautionary measure, leaving them with an impressive $325.2m in cash and cash-like investments.

Even accounting for this the quarterly numbers still appear very stable, with a debt to assets of 61.86%

Source: [Wallmine](https://gb.wallmine.com/nasdaq/ttd)

In terms of liabilities, the only debt on the Q1 sheet is the credit facility drawdown. The real risks come in the expenses and liabilities from their customers who have different terms, creating $947.9m in accounts receivable with $663.4m in accounts payable. The result is a particularly debt-free business, which explains the extremely strong financial strength of the business. Rather than owning to suppliers, it's chasing your customers to pay the bills before you incur the costs.

In terms of a value purchase. We are trading at all-time high levels, with a P/E ratio of 113.67x, and with the more generous price to sales ratio of 19.67x. As Trade Desk is a technology company, how much is that tech worth? They are not unique in the market, and they face threats from the very networks they collaborate with.

In my mind, you don't have to worry about Warren Buffett suddenly showing up and sinking a few million into Trade Desk. While the company is extremely proud of its ability to self fund their growth and development, that has been realised by the rest of the market some time ago.

A few weeks ago this would have been a more interesting momentum play, but only at the lowest points would this have been a viable value investment. A few companies I've looked at have claimed they are more like industry X but make no mistake, Trade Desk is a technology company.

To round out the assessment we must gauge the momentum and future growth potential of Trade Desk. I'll be leaning on the sell-side analysts for this view.

The analysts have been shifting from a strong buy in the previous months to settling on some slight optimism but largely a hold rating. What I found interesting was the number of share price targets which have been hit or are now close, meaning the analyst needs to reassess. Given what is happening in the market, I can forgive the sell-side analysts for being busier than usual.

To help take their views into context with where we are now, I wanted to judge the future revenues, EPS, and target price.

With a better than average expected growth, but an extremely low expected return means the market considers Trade Desk's future revenue to be in line with expectations and very achievable, this also correlates with the speedy share price recovery. 

I wanted to see the target prices myself before making any final decisions.

The average target price is a 12.70% decrease. With such a speedy and aggressive bull run, Trade Desk has blown away expectations. What we are left with is a bunch of unknown positions. The fundamental calculations aren't adding up and we are now investing based on business as usual meaning we will open the advertising taps with greater gusto.

With such a heavy dependency on America, we are seeing riots, fears about a deadly second wave of COVID-19, and even political advertising on social media being dragged back into the limelight. Is this the time to be bullish on businesses returning to heavy pre-COVID advertising numbers?

**Why Do I Think A Hold?**

If I looked at Trade Desk a few weeks ago I like to think I would have had a different view, but right now this is an extremely overbought and expensive stock, that is already brushing against its peak.

I would not be as pessimistic as to call this a sell, the company has almost no debt and has done an excellent job of controlling its contracts to provide a steady and reliable income. If you are invested there is no harm in ridding this out while the company carries on its growth.

As a new potential investor, I've missed the boat and don't like to look of the ocean right now. Advertising will open back up when companies want to promote their social messages but the spend and volume will be way below what we have seen in the past. We are facing more and more reasons for businesses to delay and play carefully in the US, while Trade Desk might be a winner in their space that doesn't mean they have an easy ride for the next six months.

It's worth keeping an eye on them to see if the price cheapens, but I would worry they could be losing their competitive edge without endless investment into their data abilities. With no dividend and a negative targeted share price, there isn't anything which is indicating a meaningful payoff for me as a shareholder. For now, I'll keep my money for a different opportunity. 

Let me know what you think of the analysis, anything I missed or you would want more detail on? I've been having a great time looking at these different stocks, and I always love to hear your thoughts.

This is my first time sharing my analysis on RobinHood, so hopefully you've found it useful!

2020-03-03,I was one of the few who benefited from the RH crash of 2020,"I was one of the few who benefited from the RH crash of 2020 I just started investing in July 2019 and gradually accumulated a 5k+ loss. Last Friday 2/28/20 I had an idea to buy some AAPL $300 3/6 calls when it was around 265$/share. Come Monday, I see Apple having a rally all the way up to nearly $299.00/share. I spent the entire day trying to sell my position from the 290-295 range, but to no avail. I wake up Tuesday to AAPL at $302.00 and was able to sell everything before the app crashed again. By far, the greatest move of my investing career. I was able to recoup my losses and then some. Managed to withdraw half and play with the rest. Just wanted to share this story about how an unfortunate event, such as the RH crash, could possibly turn out to be a blessing in disguise.

# Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)

Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming

# Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

# Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks‚Äô State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

# Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair‚Äôs product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair‚Äôs business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user‚Äôs system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair‚Äôs market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**

The 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company‚Äôs gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).

Cash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.

# Investment Outlook

**Case for Buying**

Industry fundamentals and growth:

2020-12-17,A brief long thesis to a deep value idea,"A brief long thesis to a deep value idea Hi guys, did a brief analysis on an interesting idea (orphaned stock) that I found in the HK stock market. Would love any feedback and am open to other considerations. This was my VIC application piece. Thankss! 


If you are only interested in the main thesis and the numbers, please scroll down to the investment thesis section. 

Business Background
Lvji Technology (È©¥ËøπÁßëÊäÄ) is China's largest online tour guide provider an 86.2% market share in the online tour guide service market, a 0.4% market share of the overall tour guide service market, and a 0.02% market share of the online tourism market in terms of GMV in 2018. Lvji has created a blue ocean, the online tour guide industry, and is spearheading the disruption of the traditional tour guide market. With the entire travel industry in China grinding to a halt in H1 2020, smaller competitors do not have the balance sheet and operational flexibility to survive. This environment is beneficial for Lvji in the long term as it is able to take up greater market share and roll out new synergistic initiatives.

Lvji deploys software on Alibaba Cloud to provide online tour guides with proprietary contents. These contents include illustrated maps of tourists attractions, editorial contents, voice-over commentaries of points of interest. There is a full list of patents and copyrights associated with these contents at the bottom of Lvji's IPO prospectus. These features are aggregated and implemented to include other function such as real-time navigation. For instance, a user who is exploring the Great Wall of China will experience real-time voice-over commentaries depending on the location of the user. 

Lvji generates a substantial portion of their revenue from the sales of online tour guides through Online Travel Agencies (OTA), such as Meituan, Ctrip, Quniu, etc. The relationship between Lvji and these OTAs allows Lvji to rapidly grow its customer base with little to no marketing spend. The typical cut these OTAs are entitled to be approximately 40-50% of the price of the map. Lvji managed to enter and maintain two exclusive agreements with the two of the top 5 OTAs that they work with. The two OTAs enjoy a higher cut of 50%. It is useful to note that prices of their online tour guides sold through OTAs range from approximately RMB3.9 to RMB7.4 (USD0.6 - USD1.13). With prices that are already extremely low and creates so much value for the consumer, it is extremely undesirable and foolish for a competitor to enter the market and potentially start a price war. This also provides Lvji with the optionality to increase the price of its online tour guides as they roll out new features to enhance the experience. 

Lvji also generates an extremely small portion of the revenue from traditional agencies, where these agencies buy a fixed number of online tour guides with activation codes from Lvji at a fixed price. Lvji has its own APP that is currently not widely used, and hence, also only represent a minuscule portion of its total revenue. 

I am inclined to completely discount these two areas of the business as the success of its APP is highly dependent on the execution ability of its management team. This will naturally require a lot of marketing expense and resources that may distract Lvji from dominating the industry. Besides, I'm not sure if we can trust the 5* reviews on Lvji's APP.

Outside of the sale of online tour guide, Lvji provides services for customized content to administrators of tourist attractions and local government offices. Lvji creates proprietary online tour guide contents for tourist attractions in a form of an independent APP or mini-program commissioned by the administrators of the tourist attractions, and charge one-time service fees. These guides may include AI commentaries, automatic positioning, and other additional functions. While the revenue from content customization is still currently insignificant, it is clear that the management intends to develop this area. 

From the latest 2020 interim report, Lvji has mentioned that they are actively seeking new synergistic initiatives to create value for attraction administrators. I believe that the success or failure of any industry within China is heavily influenced by the government's policies. While this may also be the case for many countries with varying degree, the impact is extremely apparent within China. It is clear that China has set the directive to digitalize the tourism industry, with tourism being one of the key pillars of China's strategic industries. This trend has also been accelerated due to COVID. A quick relevant google search should land you a few informative articles.

Suppliers. OTAs are categorized as suppliers as their concession fees are recognized as their cost of sales from an accounting perspective. However, they are not actually Lvji's suppliers in its supply chain. OTAs provide the platform for Lvji to reach out to millions of travellers within China. To fuel Lvji's high growth for the past 2 to 3 years, Lvji resorted to outsourcing the raw content and data collection from third parties before aggregating these content as part of their own. This scalable business model reduces the need for excessive manpower for routine work. 

Industry Dynamics and Lvji's role
Lvji has commissioned Frost & Sullivan, independent market research and consultant, to report on the online tourism industry and online tour guide service industry in China. I note the obvious agency problem here and Frost & Sullivan may be inclined to be biased towards the future of the industry but I would still like to highlight a few data points and colour they provided. I will be largely ignoring their expectations of the growth rates over the next few years as I do not understand the fundamental backing behind those numbers, albeit seemingly conservative. Feel free to have a look and comment if you agree or disagree with their forecasts.

General macro tailwinds. Rising per capita disposable income and strong demand for tourism have been driving the growth of the tourism market in China, where the offline tourism market experienced a CAGR of 9.1% and online with 32.5% per annum from 2014 to 2018. I would like to point out that it may be interesting to note that while the industry as a whole is still growing very quickly, the divergence in growth rates highlights a telling underlying trend. The Chinese are transiting from an offline economy to an online one very rapidly. For the better or worse, the Chinese are typically more open to the prompting of the government - from picking up contactless payments to product preferences, and now, the tour experience. As more of the youth rapidly represent a larger proportion of tourists, unlike the older generations, they prefer greater autonomy and independence in their travelling experience. Lvji matches their needs by remotely providing in-depth attraction information that they could otherwise only enjoy under a traditional tour guide's lead. We can only imagine how much more economically feasible to go with the remote option as well. Locals at the entrance of a tourist attraction may charge up to RMB600 - RMB700 for a personally guided tour. Well, one can argue that there is value in the personal touch but is the touch worth RMB600 - RMB8 (the price of map)= RMB592? I am not too sure but some may even view the added personal touch as a reduction of value instead. 

Online Tourism Agency market. The OTA industry is neither extremely concentrated nor highly fragmented. The top five OTAs accounted for 82.0% of China's online tourism market in terms of GMV in 2018 but there are hundreds of smaller players, possible with their own niche. A few of the larger players are Meituan, Ctrip, Qunar, and Alibaba's Fliggy. The OTA industry, however, is extremely competitive. There are numerous internet giants in China that are always interested in grabbing a piece of the pie wherever they go. Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu are the giants partially behind the digital transformation of many industries, from e-commerce to ride-sharing, to food-delivery, and travel. This dynamics may explain why the OTAs are willing to rapidly adopt Lvji's products as part of their platform. If an OTA observes that one of its competitors have a new and superior feature, it is necessary to get on board quickly. 

Number of tourist attractions. There are more than 31,692 tourist attractions within China and Lvji has covered 22,044 tourist attractions, comprising of close to 100% of all A grade tourist attractions. It is curious to note that the value of their product and service becomes very apparent for lower grade tourist attractions that are typically less covered by traditional tour guides. I believe that this is likely to be an eventually winner-takes-all market where it is a lot more convenient and consistent to use a product from a large company that has wide attraction coverage for different attractions than to use different products from different providers with varying quality and features. 

Tour guide service market in China. Tour guide can be mainly divided into online tour guide, audio guide, and personal tour guide. The total revenue of the tour guide service market has increased from approximately RMB38.5B in 2014 to approximately RMB66.7B in 2018, a CAGR of approximately 14.8%. The online tour guide market contributed only 0.0007% and 0.5% of the overall tour guide service market in 2015 and 2018 respectively. I do believe that while there is still value in having a personal tour guide for some tourists, Lvji's online tour guide if implemented properly, should naturally replace the need for audio guides and a substantial proportion of personal tour guides. 

Dennis Hong of ShawSpring Partners mentioned how SEA has a subtle but extremely valuable real estate that is embedded in each of its loyal users' phone - the Shopee APP. The customer may or may not purchase anything on the first few usages of the APP, but when the user has any intention of purchase, there is a strong likelihood of turning to the APP if the user likes the user experience. While Lvji has an extremely long way to develop its own APP, existing users of their product via OTAs should recognize the incremental value Lvji brings compared to using traditional options. 

Online tour guide market. Strong government policies, increasing internet penetration rate, and the preference for self-guided and in-depth tourism experience has led to impressive growth in the online tour guide service market. The market experienced a CAGR of 942.6% from RMB0.3M in 2015 to RMB340.0M in 2018. Do note that this only represents 0.5% of the overall tour guide service market. There is no reason why this percentage shouldn't grow over time. 

Government Support. 
'According to the ‚Äú13th Five-Year Tourism Development Plan‚Äù „Ää‚ÄúÂçÅ‰∏â‰∫î‚ÄùÊóÖÈÅäÊ•≠ÁôºÂ±ïË¶èÂäÉ„Äã issued by the State Council, China will further improve the tourism market as tourism becomes one of the pillars of China‚Äôs strategic industries. Innovation in the tourism industry is expected to provide people with high-quality and specialized choices which provide new types of tourist attractions as well as the potential market for online tour guide service. In addition, information infrastructure development is also expected to be improved and strengthened, including comprehensive coverage of free Wi-Fi, online tour guide, electronic interpreter, online booking, and push notification of tourist attractions information above category AAAA by 2020, which encourages the development of online tour guide service market nationwide in the near future.' - Lvji IPO Prospectus
Lvji has already been working with many tourist attraction and government administrators to provide the infrastructure for smart tourism. While I cannot precisely quantify or evaluate how much of a tailwind this provides, it is comforting to know that Lvji is swimming with the policy current. 

Strategic direction and capital allocation
In the latest interim report, they stated they plan to use AR and AI technologies to build a digital marketing platform centred on ticket sales of tourist destinations, and integrate the ticketing, management, marketing, and promotion of tourist destinations with the surrounding amenities (shopping, etc.). They intend to integrate other features that seem like buzzwords to me. I cannot evaluate what exactly they are doing here even though they seem to be doing quite a bit. 

They also mentioned that they are actively watching for M&A opportunities to grow/ enhance their core operations. This may have been the motivating force behind the PIPE deal that was recently passed.

On 12 October 2020, Lvji had a PIPE deal that is worth HK$47.9M issued to three strategic subscribers. 'The net proceeds are intended to be used for (1) operating expenses such as hiring additional employees and procuring advanced hardware and software equipment to increase the Group's productivity; and (2) equity acquisition and investment of high-quality enterprises associated with the Company's business. '


Management
Mr. Zang Weizhong is a 12-year China Mobile executive before he embarked on this start-up. Mr. Zang currently directly owns 399M shares, representing 28% of all shares outstanding. He has purchased 746,000 shares from the open market at 0.89.

I have read through a few transcripts of Mr. Zang's interview and it seems like he has his eyes set on the long-term. You can take a look at a few (and google translate) here:

Here, Mr. Zang talks about how Lvji seeks to be mediocre on the surface but brilliant in its core. Charismatic leaders like Jack Welsch tend to have the most attention and praise. They are usually in the limelight and are influential in the media. However, the book 'The Outsiders' presented findings that are contrary to the common wisdom. Capital allocators that are introverted, quiet, and brilliant seem to have a better shot at creating the most shareholder value - perhaps because they are less concerned about what the media thinks about them. 

Mr. Zang recognized that Lvji has created a blue ocean, 'Ê∏∏‰∏≠Âú∫ÊôØÁöÑËìùÊµ∑Â∏ÇÂú∫', and is currently only at its early stage of growth. He believes that it is the best to make as little scene as possible while growing rapidly quietly. 

Risks

Micro-cap Chinese company: Corporate Governance
While there is a general understanding that larger Chinese companies that work very closely with the CCP are typically 'clean', I cannot have the same level of confidence in the smaller firms. The premise is that the Chinese government cannot afford to lose face if these large companies turn out to be fraudulent. This poses a huge reputational risk in the financial system and the CCP itself. China is still at a crucial stage of development to decouple from its 'ÂÖ≥Á≥ª' roots, where ÂÖ≥Á≥ª is relationship in mandarin, and the line between corruption and relationship is blurred. 
I believe that few are foreign to the number of high profile frauds that come from China: Luckin Coffee, Sino Forest, Longwei Petroleum, and others that typically listed in the US via reverse mergers. A few red flags that I highlighted are:
‚Ä¢ Several inconsistencies in the metrics reported in their IPO prospectus vs those reported in their interim and annual report. This could either mean that they are attempting to hide a slowdown or just be a lack of depth in reporting. 
‚Ä¢ Little brand recognition in China. The reason why I completely discounted the value of its proprietary APP is due to a lack of presence in China. The reviews seem to be fake and bought.
‚Ä¢ Odd IPO pricing. Lvji IPO'ed at HK$2.12, oversubscribed by 84.66 times. At HK$2.12, Lvji has a market capitalization of HK$3B. For a company that generated HK$642M in revenue, HK$203M in operating income, HK$190M in net profits, net cash of HK$91M in FY2019, that‚Äôs only a valuation of EV/Sales = 4.53x, EV/EBIT = 14.33x. Bear in mind that Lvji is a company that has its top line growing at 400%, 300%, and 80%, 3 years prior to its IPO. Why? 

High reliance on OTAs, lack of proprietary brand
It is clear that Lvji's business is entirely dependent on OTAs. I would argue that the more fragmented the OTAs are, the better it is for Lvji. Since Lvji will have greater bargaining power over these OTAs. However, if these OTAs suffer and, say, the industry undergoes a consolidation, the balance of power may shift and reduce the cut Lvji gets out of their products on the surviving OTAs. This is, of course, just speculation as I lack sufficient knowledge to know how the industry dynamics will pan out in the future. It is good to note that the top 2 customers, Meituan and Ctrip, represent 57.7% and 37.3% of their total revenue respectively. 

Execution Risk
From observing how Lvji allocates their capital and the update in the latest Interim Report, Mr. Zang has the intention to ramp up investments in developing their nascent content customization division. This is likely to require huge upfront investments for long term monopoly benefits over the customer's tourist attraction. Due to how new this area is, it is almost impossible to evaluate the probability of success of the venture. We are unable to tell how much competition there will be eventually if Lvji's progress proves to be promising and profitable. 

Lack of competitors for meaningful comparison 
Lvji has been very successful in dominating the online tour guide service market but this also means that there are no true competitors that we can draw a comparison to. It is unfair to compare to other companies in the travel industry, say the OTAs, given the vastly different competitive environment. We will have to make do with the information we have at hand and posit the likely outcomes. 


Investment Thesis
With downside risks considered, we explore what actually makes Lvji a compelling investment with favourable risk-reward ratios.

Promising outlook with a strong growth profile
From the above, I believe it is clear that odds are in the online tour guide market's and Lvji's favour for the industry to continue to experience strong growth post-COVID. The Total Addressable Market (TAM) is not easy to pinpoint due to the uncertainty behind the future growth of the industry. However, it is helpful to note that a 5% market share of the overall tour guide service market in 2023 would be RMB6.15B in online tour guide service market GMV, assuming an expected tour guide service market GMV of RMB123.7B in 2023. The GMV of online tour guide service market is at RMB340M in 2018. 

Cheap
The overall depressing short-term outlook of the travel industry has heavily penalized Lvji's share price unfairly. Lvji is a business that has experienced strong top-line growth of 400%, 320%, and 79.6% for the three years prior to its IPO on 16 January 2020. With an asset-light business model, it has also been able to generate positive and growing operating income with an attractive margin of approximately 30%. As a testament to its flexible asset-light model, Lvji has successfully optimized its cost structure and control its cash burn to only a -RMB14M cash outflow from operating activities. It may also be telling to note that Lvji has actually ramped up its investment activities from RMB234M for 6 months ended 30 June 2019, to RMB501M for the same period ended 30 June 2020. The investments are largely associated with its smart tourism initiatives and upgrading of its software. Lvji's has a healthy net cash balance of RMB549M as of 30 June 2020.

Lvji currently has a market capitalization of HK$1.3B, net cash of HK$651M (0.45HKD per share!), and EV of HK$649M. With 2019 revenue of HK$643M and EBIT of HK$186.3M, we have EV/Sales = 1.01x and EV/EBIT = 3.49x. This is beyond cheap even if Lvji stops growing. 

Unlikely to be a value trap
A value trap typically exists when a cheap business remains cheap for a very long time. This usually happens to melting ice cubes with ever-deteriorating business fundamentals. However, in the case of Lvji, given how fast it is expected to compound over the next 3-5 years, it is extremely unlikely for Lvji's market multiple to continue halving as its earnings double. 


Catalyst

Why does this opportunity exist and catalyst

1. COVID. A small no-name Chinese travel company with no big names backing decides to IPO in the peak of pandemic in China. It is likely that investors had no appetite to take on such a risk. With HK-listed companies only reporting twice a year, the first half of 2020 was horrendous for Lvji. Any update on performance is expected to only come in next year March. 
2. Micro-capitalization company with no analyst and media coverage. This is quite self-explanatory. This is likely to be the reason why there is little to no investor interests in the company. 
3. Strong domestic recovery. Domestic travel within China has already almost recovered to pre-COVID highs. More than 600M people travelled in China during Golden week. With the immunization program out in China and strong faith in the government, domestic consumption and tourism appetite have recovered extremely strongly. Added precautions to reduce physical contact has also benefitted travel software businesses like Lvji. Assuming Lvji still remains as the company as we know, the next interim report in March 2021 should show that Lvji is back to its growth trajectory. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/china-attractions-630-million-people-travel-during-golden-week.html

Valuation
It is more than an art than science to value a high growth company. Due to a lack of knowledge, I have no opinions regarding the long-term compounding potential of Lvji and will seriously consider exiting my position when the valuation becomes 'fair' as investors start recognizing what we have here. 
While I disagree with the widespread consensus of using EV/S to evaluate the cheapness of any high growth software business, a company with such growth profile, balance sheet, and margins listed in the US will typically command minimally a EV/S of 10.0x. An EV/EBIT of 20.0x - 30.0x seems fair for a business that is cash generative and expected to grow minimally for another 3-5 years with at least 20.0% CAGR, conservatively.
This gives us a present target price range of between HK$5 to $9. 

I believe that even after considering the risks associated with investing in an obscure COVID-hit travel stock in China, a strong alignment of management interests, strong balance sheet, and a cheap price tag offers very good risk-reward profile that warrants a high conviction position.

**Summary**

High-growth, profitable company is the only differentiated provider in a large, growing, and underserved market. PGNY‚Äôs high-touch, seamless offering helps them stand out against large insurance carriers. Covid-19 has shown the importance of benefits for employees and will continue to be the key differentiator for those thinking of changing jobs. According to RMANJ (Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey), 68% of people would switch jobs for fertility benefits.

For employers, Progyny reduces costs by including the latest cutting-edge technology in one packaged price, thereby lowering the risk of multiples and increasing the likelihood of pregnancy, keeping employees happy with an integrated, data-driven, concierge service partnering with a selective group of fertility doctors. 

Upside potential is 2x current price in the next 18 months. 

**Overview**

Progyny Inc. (Nasdaq: PGNY), ‚ÄúPGNY‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, based in New York, NY, is the leading independent fertility and family building benefits manager. Progyny serves as a value-add benefits manager sold to employers who want to improve their benefits coverage and retain and attract the best employees. Progyny offers a comprehensive solution and is truly disrupting the fertility industry.

There is no standard fertility cycle, but the below is a good approximation of possible workflows:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7aip8pna9zi51.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ef868a67eae10534bac254ab58fb3d4295aef37

1. Patient is referred to fertility center for evaluation for Assisted Reproductive Technology (‚ÄúART‚Äù) procedures, including in-vitro fertilization (‚ÄúIVF ‚Äú) and intrauterine insemination (‚ÄúIUI‚Äù). Both can be aided by pharmaceuticals that stimulate egg production in the female patient. IVF involves the fertilization of the egg and sperm in the lab, while IUI is direct injection of the sperm sample into the uterus. Often, IUI is done first as it is less expensive. As success rates of IVF have increased, IUI utilization will likely fall.

2. Sperm washing is the separation of the sperm from the semen sample for embryo creation, and it enhances the freezing capacity of the sperm. Typically, a wash solution is added to the sample and then a centrifuge is used to undergo separation. This is done in both IUI and IVF.

3. Some OB/GYN platforms are pursuing vertical integration and offering fertility services directly. The OB would need to be credentialed at the lab / procedure center. 

4. Specialty pharmacy arranges delivery of temperature sensitive Rx. Drug regimens include ovarian stimulation to increase the number of eggs or hormone manipulation to better time fertility cycles, among others.

5. Oocyte retrieval / aspiration is done under deep-sedation anesthesia in a procedure room, typically in the attached IVF lab. Transfer cycle implantation is done using ultrasound guidance without anesthesia. (Anecdotally, we have been told that only REIs can perform an egg retrieval. We have not been able to validate this).

6. Many clinics house frozen embryos on-site, while some clinics contract with 3rd parties to manage the process. During an IVF cycle, embryos are created from all available eggs. Single-embryo transfer (‚ÄúSET‚Äù) is becoming the norm, which means that multiple embryos are then cryopreserved to use in the future. A fertility preservation cycle ends here with a female storing eggs for long-term usage (e.g. a woman in her young 20s deciding to freeze her eggs for starting a family later).

7. Common nomenclature refers to an IVF cycle or an IVF cycle with Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (‚ÄúICSI‚Äù). From a technical perspective, ICSI and IVF are different forms of embryo fertilization within an ART cycle.

8. ART clinics are frequently offering ancillary services such as embryo / egg adoption or surrogacy services. More frequently, there are independent companies that help with the adoption process and finding surrogates.

9. ART procedures are broken into two different types of cycles: a banking cycle is the process by which eggs are gathered, embryos are created and then transferred to cryopreservation. A transfer cycle is typically the transfer of a thawed embryo to the female for potential pregnancy. If a pregnancy does not occur, another transfer cycle ensues. Many REIs are moving towards a banking cycle, freezing all embryos, then transfer cycles until embryos are exhausted or a birth occurs. If a birth occurs with the first embryo, patients can keep their embryos for future pregnancy attempts, donate the embryos to a donation center, or request the destruction of the embryos. 

The Company started as Auxogen Biosciences, an egg-freezing provider before changing business models to focus on providing a full-range of fertility benefits. In 2016, they launched with their first 5 employer clients and 110,000 members. As of June 30, 2020, the Company provided benefits to 134 employers and \~2.2 million members, year over year growth of 63%. 134 employers is less than 2% of the total addressable market of ‚Äúapproximately 8,000 self-insured employers in the United States (excluding quasi-governmental entities, such as universities and school systems, and labor unions) who have a minimum of 1,000 employees and represent approximately 69 million potential covered lives in total. Our current member base of 2.1 million represents only 3% of our total market opportunity.‚Äù

The utilization rate for all Progyny members was less than 1% in 2019, offering significant leverageable upside as the topic of fertility becomes less taboo.

Fertility has historically been a process fraught one-sided knowledge, even more so than the typical physician procedure. Despite the increased availability of information on the internet, women who undergo fertility treatments have often described the experience as ‚Äúbyzantine‚Äù and ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù. Outdated treatment models without the latest technology (or the latest tech offered as expensive a la carte options) continue to be the norm at traditional insurance providers as well as clinics that do not accept insurance. Progyny‚Äôs differentiated approach, including a high-touch concierge level of service for patients and data-driven decision making at the clinical level, has led to an NPS of 72 for fertility benefits and 80 for the integrated, optional pharmacy benefit. 

Typically, fertility benefits offered by large insurance carriers are add-ons to existing coverage subject to a lifetime maximum while simultaneously requiring physicians to try IUI 3 ‚Äì 6 times before authorizing IVF. The success rate of IUI, also known as artificial insemination, is typically less than 10%, even when performed with medication. As mentioned in Progyny‚Äôs IPO ‚ÄúA patient with mandated fertility step therapy protocol may be required to undergo three to six cycles of IUI, which has an average success rate range of 5% to 15%, takes place over three to six months and can cost up to $4,000 per cycle (or an aggregate of approximately $12,000 to $24,000), according to FertilityIQ. Multiple rounds of mandated IUI is likely to exhaust the patient's lifetime dollar maximum fertility benefits and waste valuable time before more effective IVF treatment can be begun.‚Äù 

**Success Rates for IVF** 

IVF success rates vary greatly by age but were 49% on average for women younger than 35. The graph below shows success rates by all clinics by age group for those that did at least 10 cycles in the specific age group. As an example, for those in the ages 35 ‚Äì 37, out of 456 available clinics, 425 performed at least 10 cycles with a median success rate of 39.7%.

Progyny‚Äôs Smart Cycle is the proprietary method the company has chosen as a ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù for fertility benefits. As opposed to a traditional fee-for-service model with step-up methods, employers may choose to provide between 2 and unlimited Smart Cycles to employees. This enables employees to choose the provider‚Äôs best method. Included in the Smart Cycle, and another indicator of the Company‚Äôs forward-thinking methodology, are treatment options that deliver better outcomes (PGS, ICSI, multiple embryo freezing with future implantations). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/np577a389zi51.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=c061a2b24c8515890ba204479b4677893dabf755

As detailed in the chart above, a patient could undergo an IVF cycle that freezes all embryos (3/4 of a Smart Cycle), then transfer 5 frozen embryos (1/4 cycle each; each transfer would occur at peak ovulation, which would take at least 5 months) and use only 2 Smart Cycles. Alternatively, if the patient froze all embryos and got pregnant on the first embryo transfer, they would only use one cycle. 

Before advances in vitrification (freezing), patients could not be sure that an embryo created in the lab and frozen for later use would be viable, so using only one embryo at a time seemed wasteful. Now, as freezing technology has advanced, undergoing one pharmaceutical regime, one oocyte collection procedure, creating as many embryos as possible, and then transferring one embryo back into the uterus while freezing the rest provides the highest ROI. If the first transferred embryo fails to implant or otherwise does not lead to a baby, the patient can simply thaw the next embryo and try implantation again next month. 

Included in each Smart Cycle is pre-implantation genetic sequencing (‚ÄúPGS‚Äù) on all available embryos and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (‚ÄúICSI‚Äù). PGS uses next-generation sequencing technology to determine the viability and sex of the embryo while ICSI is a process whereby a sperm is directly inserted into the egg to start fertilization, rather than allowing the sperm to penetrate the egg naturally. ICSI has a slightly higher rate of successful fertilization (as opposed to simply leaving the egg and sperm in the petri dish). 

Because Progyny‚Äôs experience is denominated in cycles of care, not simply dollars, patients and doctors can focus on what procedures offer the best return. 30% of the Company‚Äôs existing network of doctors do not accept insurance of any kind, other than Progyny, which speaks to the value that is provided to doctors and employers.

For patients not looking to get pregnant, Progyny offers egg freezing as well. Progyny started as an egg-freezing manager, which allows a woman to preserve her fertility and manage her biological clock. As mentioned previously, pregnancy outcomes vary significantly and align closely with the age of the egg. Egg freezing is designed to allow a woman to save her younger eggs until she is ready to start a family. From an employer‚Äôs perspective, keeping younger women in the work force for longer is a cost savings. Vitrification technology has improved significantly since ‚ÄúFreeze your eggs, Free Your Career‚Äù was the headline on Bloomberg Businesweek in 2014, but we still don‚Äôt yet know the pregnancy rates for women who froze their eggs 5 years ago, but early results are promising and on par with IVF rates for women of similar ages now. 

From a female perspective, the egg freezing process is not an easy one. The patient is still required to inject themselves with stimulation drugs and the egg retrieval process is the same as in the IVF process (under sedation). The same number of days out of work are required. Using the SmartCycle benefit above as an example, the egg freezing process would require ¬Ω of a Smart Cycle. The annual payment required to the clinic is typically included in the benefits package but may require out-of-pocket expenses covered by the employee. 

Contrary to popular belief, IVF pregnancies do not have a higher rate of multiples (twins, triplets, etc.), rather in order to reduce out of pocket costs, REIs have transferred multiple embryos to the patient, in the hopes of achieving a pregnancy. If you have struggled for years to get pregnant, and the doctor is suggesting that transferring 3 embryos at once is your best chance at success, you are unlikely to complain, nor are you likely to selectively eliminate an implanted embryo because you now have twins. There are several factors that are making it more likely / acceptable to transfer one embryo at a time, enabling Progyny‚Äôs success.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/48vk9gc69zi51.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c75a2771a1dd9a079074331b317451f076725ca

From the Company: ‚ÄúAccording to a study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology that analyzed the total costs of care over 400,000 deliveries between 2005 and 2010, as adjusted for inflation, the maternity and perinatal healthcare costs attributable to a set of twins are approximately $150,000 on average, more than four times the comparable costs attributable to singleton births of approximately $35,000, and often exceed this average. In the case of triplets, the costs escalate significantly and average $560,000, sometimes extending upwards of $1.0 million.‚Äù

‚ÄúProgyny's selective network of high-quality fertility specialists consistently demonstrate a strong adherence to best practices with a substantially higher single embryo transfer rate. As a result, our members experience significantly fewer pregnancies with multiples (e.g., twins or triplets). Multiples are associated with a higher probability of adverse medical conditions for the mother and babies, and as a byproduct, significantly escalate the costs for employers. Our IVF multiples rate is 3.6% compared to the national average of 16.1%. A lower multiples rate is the primary means to achieving lower high-risk maternity and NICU expenses for our clients.‚Äù 

An educated and supported patient leads to better outcomes. Each patient gets a patient care advocate who interacts with a patient, on average, 15x during their usage of fertility benefits - before treatment, during treatment and post-pregnancy. The Company provides phone-based clinical education and support seven days a week and the Company‚Äôs proprietary ‚ÄúUnPack It‚Äù call allows patients to speak to a licensed pharmacy clinician who describes the medications included in the package (which contains an average of 20 items per cycle), provides instruction on proper medication administration, and ensures that cycles start on time. The Company‚Äôs single medication authorization and delivery led to no missed or delayed cycles in 2018.

Previous conference calls have made note of the fact that the Company would like to purchase their own specialty pharmacy and own every aspect of that interaction, which should provide a lift to gross margins. This would allow PGNY to manage both the medication and the treatment, leading to decreased cost of fertility drugs. Under larger carrier programs, carriers manage access to treatment, but PBM manages access to medications, which can lead to a delay in cycle commencement. 

Progyny Rx can only be added to the Progyny fertility benefits solution (not offered without subscription to base fertility benefits) and offers patients a potentially lower cost fertility drug benefit, while streamlining what is often a frustrating part of the consumer experience. The Progyny Rx solution reduces dispensing and delivery times and eliminates the possibility that a cycle does not start on time due to a specialty pharmacy not delivering medication. Progyny bills employers for fertility medication as it is dispensed in accordance with the individual Smart Cycle contract. Progyny Rx was introduced in 2018 and represented only 5% of total revenue in 2018. By June 30, 2020, Progyny Rx represented 28% of total revenue and increased 15% y/y. The growth rate should slow and move more in line with the fertility benefits solution as the existing customer base adds it to their package. 

Progyny Rx can save employers 5% on spend for typical carrier fertility benefits or 21% of the drug spend. Prior authorization is not required, and the pre-screened network of specialty pharmacies can deliver within 48 hours. Additionally, PGNY has 1-year contracts, as opposed to 3 ‚Äì 5 years like standard PBMs, but with guaranteed minimums, allowing them to purchase at discounts and pass part of the savings on to employers ‚Äì another reason the attachment rate is so high. 

**Large, Underpenetrated Addressable Market**

Total cycle counts are increasing (below, in 000s), including both freezing cycles and intended-pregnancy cycles. Acceleration in cycle volume is likely driven by a declining birth rate as women wait later in life to start a family, resulting in reduced fertility, as well as the number of non-traditional (LGBT and single parents). Conservatively, we believe cycles can double in the next 8 years, a 7% CAGR. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6y7jb559zi51.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cc5cdde7c6583d8e943d2675ad3b6ae85f818de

Progyny believes its addressable market is the $6.7B spent on infertility treatments in 2017, but these numbers could easily understate the available market and potential patients as over 50% of people in the US who are diagnosed as infertile do not seek treatment. Additionally, according to the Company, 35% of its covered universe did not previously have fertility benefits in place previously, meaning there is a growing population of people who are now considering their fertility options. According to Willis Towers, Watson, \~ 55% of employers offered fertility benefits in 2018. 

A quick review of CDC stats and FertilityIQ shows a significant disparity in outcomes and emotions for those who are seeking treatment. While technology in the embryo lab is improving rapidly and success rates between clinics should be converging, there continue to be significant outliers. Clinics that follow what are now generally accepted procedures (follicle stimulating hormones, a 5-day incubation period and PGS to determine embryo viability) have seen success rates of at least 40%. There continue to be several providers that offer a mini-IVF cycle or natural IVF cycle. Designed to appeal to cost conscious cash payors, the on average $5,000 costs, is simply IVF without prescription drugs or any add-ons such as PGS. However, the success rates are on par with IUI and there is an abundance of patients over 40 using the service, where the success rates are already low. Additionally, success stories at these clinics frequently align with what is perceived as the worst parts of the process:

One clinic offering a natural cycle IVF has a rating at FertilityIQ of \~8.0 with 60% of people strongly recommending it. This clinic performed 2,000 cycles in 2018 (the most recently available data from the CDC), making it one of the top 10 most active fertility center in the US. Their success rate for women under 35 was 23%, as opposed to the national average of 50% for all clinics. For women over 43, the average success rate for the most active 40 clinics in this demographic was 5.0% this clinics success rate was 0.4%. The lower success rate is likely due to the lack of pre-cycle drugs and PGS, but the success rate and the average rating is hard to understand. Part of this could be to the customer service provided by the clinic, or the perceived benefit of having to go into the office less often for check-ups when not doing a medication driven cycle. 

. 

Reviews from other clinics with high average customer ratings, but low success rates include:

\- ‚Äústart of a journey that consisted of multiple IUI‚Äôs with numerous medications, but they were not successful.‚Äù 

\- After an IVF retrieval, the couple had two viable embryos, both were transferred the next month‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúThe couple started with a series of IUI treatments, three in total that were not successful.‚Äù 

\- ‚ÄúAfter a fresh transfer of two embryos, again another unsuccessful cycle‚Äù.

\- ‚ÄúHe suggested transferring 2 due to higher implantation rates, but there is increased rate of twins ‚Äú

Progyny‚Äôs comps have typically been other high-growth companies that went public in the last two years: 1Life Healthcare (ONEM), Accolade (ACCD), Health Catalyst (HCAT), Health Equity (HQY), Livongo (LVGO), Phreesia (PHR), as well as Teladoc (TDOC). Despite revenue growth that outpaces these companies, PGNY‚Äôs revenue multiple of 4.4x 2021E revenue is a 40% discount to the peer group median. PNGY‚Äôs lower gross margin is likely limiting the multiple. However, Progyny is the one of the few profitable companies in this group and the only one with realistic EBTIDA margins. SG&A leverage is the most likely driver of increased EBITDA and can be achieved by utilizing data to improve clinical outcomes in the future, but primarily by increased productive of the sales reps, including larger employer wins and larger employee utilization.

Perhaps the best direct comp is Bright Horizons (BFAM). BFAM offers childcare as a healthcare benefit where employees can use pre-tax dollars to pay for childcare. BFAM offers both onsite childcare centers built to the employer‚Äôs specification (owned by the employer and operated by BFAM), as well as shared-site locations that are open to the public and back-up sitter services. Currently, PGNY is trading at 4.4x 2021E Revenue, in-line with BFAM‚Äôs 4.3x multiple. I would argue that PGNY should trade significantly higher given the asset-lite business model and higher ROIC. 

**Recent Results**

Post Covid-19, fertility treatments came back faster than anticipated, combined with disciplined operations, PGNY drove revenue and EBITDA above 2Q2020 consensus estimates. Utilization is still below historical levels, but management‚Äôs visibility led to excellent FY21 revenue estimates (consensus is around $555M, a y/y increase of 62%. 

2Q2020 revenue increased 15% to $64.6M, and EBITDA increased 18% to $6.5M, primarily driven by SBC as the 15% revenue was not enough to leverage the additional G&A people hired in the last 18 months. The end of the quarter as fertility docs opened their offices back up for remote visits saw better operating margin. 

Despite the shutdown in fertility clinics during COVID-19, Progyny was able to successfully add several clients. 

‚ÄúThe significant majority of the clinics in our network chose to adhere to ASRMs guidelines, and our volume of fertility treatments and dispensing of the related medications declined significantly over the latter part of the quarter. . . Through the end of March and into the first half of April, we saw significant reductions in the utilization of the benefit by our members down to as low as 15%, when compared to the early part of Q1 were 15% of what we consider to be normal levels. In April, the New York Department of Health declared that fertility is an essential health service and stated that clinics have the authority to treat their patients and perform procedures during the pandemic. Then on April 24, ASRM updated its guidelines which were reaffirmed on May 11, advising that practices could reopen for all procedures so long as it could be done in a measured way that is safe for patients and staff.‚Äù

Revenue increased by $33.8 million, 72% in 1Q2020. This increase is primarily due to a $19.0 million, or 47% increase, in revenue from fertility benefits. Additionally, the Company experienced a $14.8 million or 216% increase in revenue from specialty pharmacy. Revenue growth was due to the increase in the number of clients and covered lives. Progyny Rx revenue growth outpaced the fertility benefits revenue since Progyny Rx went live with only a select number of clients on January 1, 2018 and has continued to add both new and existing fertility benefit solution clients since its initial launch. 

**Competition**

The only true competition is the large insurance companies, but, as mentioned previously, they are not delivering care the same way.  WINFertility is the largest manager of fertility insurance benefits on behalf of Anthem, Aetna and Cigna and are not directly involved in the delivery of care. Carrot is a Silicon Valley startup that recently raised $24M in a Series B with several brand name customers (StitchFix, Slack) where they focus on negotiating discounts at fertility clinics for their customers, who then use after-tax dollars from their employers. 

**Risks to Thesis**

Though there is risk a large carrier may switch to a model similar to Progyny‚Äôs, I believe it is unlikely given the established relationships with REIs at the clinic level, the difficulty of managing a more selective network of providers, and the lack of 

interest shown previously in eliminating the IUI. It is more likely a carrier would acquire Progyny first.",0.0,Neutral,English

1.  What federal regulation does this come under?

The link is a circular for a painting as a sample. Looks like, they set up an LLC for each painting and issue shares for the appraised value. Is it legal to collect money from public and not be traded on a stock exchange? What are safeguards?
2. How can I verify their appraisal process? How reliable and conflict-free is it? Any idea is welcomed. They said that they get the majority of their appraisals from the Winston art group. I read a lot online that appraisals can sometimes be sketchy. 
3. Their charges are a bomb. 20% cut in profits after 1.5% charge every year... take a look at a sheet I put up together for calculation of returns. I am not sure if I got everything included in it. Could you take a look? They take a big chunk obviously. But historical data shows **some** extraordinary returns on the art.

2020-06-16,Verizon Analysis,"Verizon Analysis Hey everyone! I have been a lurker of the sub for a while. I just graduated (3 days ago from writing this post) from university with a degree in finance and I focused on classes where we analyzing companies as I find it very intriguing and I have actually found fun. This last quarter I took an equity analysis class and was pretty limited in what I was allowed to analyze, no FI's, or any equity analyzed in the last 4 years by another student. I ended up choosing Verizon as I thought it would be a start on learning and practicing. Here is my analysis and my hope is if any professionals out there would be willing to go through and give their input, advice, and be a critic on how to improve on my future analysis.

Some formatting may look funky as this was originally in a word doc that didn't exactly transfer over well.

Also I was forced to delete some tables and graphs due to the 20 picture upload limit, specifically I deleted MV of Debt calculations, some tables in the appendix representing WACC and cost of Equity, industry average statistics, which can be googled, my calculation of FCFE, as well as a few other minor tables, if the text refers to a table that isn't there that would be why, and I can provide to anyone upon request.

Thanks to anyone taking the time. I greatly appreciate it.

**Student Research**     **Telecommunication**

**Verizon**

6/16/2020

 Ticker: VZ 

Recommendation: **HOLD**

Price: $56.92  Price Target: $64.42

**Highlights**

¬∑ In the beginning of a 5g upgrade cycle, a significant opportunity to be a growth driver in the North American wireless market for Verizon.

¬∑ Verizon‚Äôs profit margin is at 14.61%, double compared to their competitors

¬∑ Stock market fluctuations low relative to the general market, a beta of .7, and a safe industry that many consumers deem as essential, relatively ‚Äúrecession proof‚Äù

¬∑ A dividend yield of 4.5% 

**Investment Summary**

**Dividend Growth**: The company is in its mature stage cycle with an established industry and market presence. Verizon has stable revenues with limited opportunity for growth outside of an acquisition of a smaller mobile carrier. This allows us to value Verizon mostly from its‚Äô dividend growth. Historically, Verizon has a growth rate of 2.6% in the last 10 years, in the last 5, they have a historical growth rate of 5%. A growth rate of 3.5% is estimated to be Verizon‚Äôs growth rate moving forward. Fortunately, the industry business model allows for constant cash flow and sustainability in the mature stage cycle.

**Expansion:** 5g is the one of the few areas for growth still available to Verizon, 5g refers to the next generation in wireless data transfer technology. This new technology will increase data transfer rates by up to 100-fold. The last technological advancement with 4g impacted Verizon by increasing revenues by up to 5% one year and averaged revenue growth 4.3% annually for 4 years. This effectively doubled Verizon‚Äôs revenue growth average of 2.3% annually. Outside of 5g Verizon still has expansion options including expanding its wired FIOS network, and its online presence under Verizon Media Group. 

**Stability:** Verizon is a stable cash flow company with an adjusted beta of .7. This illustrates the safety of the company‚Äôs stock. Verizon has little room for growth in the saturated wireless telecom market, meaning Verizon‚Äôs stock price is not likely to explode in value in the future. However, historically Verizon‚Äôs stock price does not fall substantially relative to the general market when macroeconomic forces cause the market to fall. Verizon is not currently competing with other equities as it is with safe debt in our current economic environment. This is because of the current interest rate environment on the U.S. 10-year being less than 1%. This causes investors to look for other high-quality investment alternatives that deliver better yield. Verizon satisfies this type of investor with a yield of over 4% as well as providing market exposure from the general market.

**Execution:** The biggest potential obstacle currently facing Verizon is their execution of rolling out 5g technology. Any hinderance can result in missed revenue, with next year‚Äôs iPhone coming out with 5g capable technology, which the iPhone has over 50% market share alone in the smartphone market, could cause many customers to switch to a competitor if Verizon cannot meet demand by that point. Let alone the other half of the market, largely denominated in various android devices, already has 5g capable technology. Should Verizon miss the mark, it could potentially hurt the company for years. However, according to Verizon‚Äôs CTO, as of the end of May, they are ahead of schedule deploying 5g. Verizon has a history and reputation of being on top of deploying new technology quickly, while being ahead of schedule, it is plausible to see many customers switch over to Verizon to take advantage of their 5g if Verizon‚Äôs competitors can‚Äôt meet the 5g demand. Verizon management needs to be able to take advantage of this new technology by charging higher prices to their mobile customers. Any lack in the execution could result in bad revenues and earnings.

**Business Description**

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is the parent company to Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group. Verizon provides services such as communications, entertainment, and information to consumer, business, and governmental customers. Employing 135,000 people, 96% are located in the U.S. and over 2,300 retail stores open, and headquartered in New York, NY. In 1877 the bell system was created in the name of Alexander Graham Bell, over time the company slowly expanded across the U.S. and Canada over the next 100 years. Over the years the system evolved to AT&T controlling a bunch of regional company‚Äôs providing land line service. In 1982 the U.S. government broke up the monopoly AT&T had into the regional companies, this plan was originally proposed by AT&T. This event was known as the breakup of the bell system and the companies post breakup were known as the ‚Äúbaby bells‚Äù. Two of the companies as a result of this breakup were Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp. Verizon was formed in June 2000 with the merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. based in New York city and GTE Corp. based in Irving Texas. Both firms were some of the largest in the industry, and both were heavily focused on the eastern side of the U.S. 

Table 1 below shows Verizon‚Äôs consolidated revenues for the years 2019 and 2018. Revenues are broken down into their three subsidiaries of Verizon Consumer, Verizon Business and Verizon Corporate. Eliminations refers to the exchange of cash between these segments as it is not new revenue. Below explains each segment and where each segment gets their revenue broken into a percentage.

Wireline is provided in North Eastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. over fiber-optic lines through their Fios brand, or wireless services provided nationwide on hotspot devices or mobile phones. Both wireline and wireless can be prepaid or postpaid, the majority are in the postpaid segment, paying monthly for the services. The consumer segment provides data connection to 95 million wireless mobile connections, 6 million broadband connections, and 4 million Fios connections: making up 68.8% of revenues.

Verizon Business Group provides the same services to corporate and some governmental agencies with additional services such as ‚Äúvideo and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products including solutions that support fleet tracking management, compliance management, field service management, and asset tracking‚Äù according to Verizon‚Äôs 2019 annual report. In all, Verizon‚Äôs Business Group is in a position to solve more complex problems that may come up at a business compared to their Consumer Group. Verizon Business Group provides 25million wireless connections and 489 thousand broadband connections: making up 23.8% of total revenues.

 Verizon Corporate includes media business, investments in businesses, and financing expenses outside of the regular course of business. The biggest section here is Verizon Media which provides third party entertainment services such as email, news, and streaming services to customers. Verizon Corporate makes up 7.4% of total revenues.

Verizon plans to position themselves into future growth trends such as increased expansion of their wireless network, high-speed fiber, and the new introduction of high-speed 5g connections on mobile devices or in-home. With over 17.9 billion invested for capital expenditures at end of year 2019 for 5g technology release.

**Environmental, Social, Governance and Management Quality**

Environmental criteria include the company‚Äôs impact on the environment such as energy use, waste output, and pollution production. In the last 10 years so called ‚Äúgreen bonds‚Äù has been discussed more about and demand for them has slowly been rising. These green bonds are any bonds issued by a company, where all the money raised from the bonds goes towards any ESG related goal. Verizon in February 2019 issued their first green bond to the total of $1 billion, this is the first green bond issued in the telecom industry as well. Verizon has stated they are committed to being completely carbon neutral in their operations by 2035; this propagates their current goal to ‚Äúgenerate renewable energy equivalent to 50% of our total annual electricity consumption by 2025‚Äù. Finally, Verizon has stated that they are committed to setting an annual emissions reduction target by fall 2021.

Social criteria include the relationships the company has with business partners, local communities, employee health and safety, and any other ‚Äústakeholder‚Äù that the company impacts. Verizon claims to focus on their customers upmost before most other stakeholders, they reinforce this through their actions and from their goal of being the best and most reliable network in the U.S. and serves this goal mainly through delivering high quality services through their wireless segment at a reasonable price. Outside of customers Verizon is aiming to contribute 2.5 million hours of volunteer work through their 135 thousand employees, these hours are aimed to improve ‚Äúdigital inclusion, climate protection, and human prosperity‚Äù. In Cleveland, Ohio the company is launching 5g enabled classrooms to deliver instruction in struggling middle schools and aims to expand this effort to 100 middle schools in total by 2021. Additionally, to evaluate the employee side of social criteria using a website called Glassdoor is used. Glassdoor is a website where current or past employees can rate the company anonymously on salary, benefits, satisfaction, outlook of the company, and their experience at the company; however, Glassdoor has been known to be biased at times. Verizon has over 21 thousand reviews on Glassdoor, from this large amount of reviews it can be taken with some accuracy. Considering all 21 thousand reviews they are rated at a 74% satisfaction rating, and 68% approve of the CEO, whereas AT&T has a 68% satisfaction rating and 51% approve of the CEO. At Verizon a controversial subject among employees are work-life balance with a 50% split on it needing some improvement or that it is adequate. Over 8,000 reviews claim that Verizon is a good employer when relating to pay and benefits.

Governance criteria includes how transparent and accurate the financial statements are, avoiding conflicts of interest among the executives and board members, and ensuring the company is not engaging in any illegal activities. As far as engaging in illegal activities Verizon has a good track record and no one suspects any major allegations against Verizon, with Verizon being a U.S. dominant business they mostly just have to obey rules and regulations within the U.S. and not balancing between international laws. Verizon has been clear in all of its financial reporting, obeying all GAAP rules and even going above the mark to provide additional information that is non-GAAP with disclosures. Conflicts of interest among the board members meet all laws and guidelines from the NYSE and NASDAQ. Verizon‚Äôs board members also meet the ‚Äúheightened independence criteria‚Äù rules from the NYSE and Nasdaq. Regarding the green bond discussed above, they have and will report on how much of the green bond money has been spent and on what projects the money is going to until the note matures.

Overall Verizon is a quality company with quality management, among the 9 board members currently, 3 are African American, and 2 are woman. The company CEO, Hans Vestberg has been with the company since 2017, and CEO since 2018, a noticeably short amount of time compared to peers at AT&T whose CEO has been with the company since 2007. Verizon‚Äôs CFO, Matthew Ellis, has been with Verizon since 2016. Verizon‚Äôs management is relatively new and most likely experiencing a learning curve still, but so far, they have made strides in redefining Verizon and shows promise to be a strong team long term. Sustainalytics is an ESG rating company who rates companies on a scale of 0-100, they rate VZ at a score of 20, AT&T with a score of 19, and T-Mobile with a score of 25. This is a low score, however, ESG scores are highly subjective and vary widely among different ESG ratings companies. Verizon does not participate in any of the ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù ESG industries such as oil or mining, meaning in the grand scheme of company‚Äôs they are a relatively sustainable company. While the company can always do better, they aim to bring diversity to the company and strive for transparency. 

**Demographic Trends**

Companies should be aware of demographics and which ones their customers fall under, this information can provide to a company who their core customer base is, and which segments they can expand into. There are many demographics out there, each with their own preferences, tolerances, and taste. Gender, race, and age are the three big demographics, however, there are many more than those three and each can be combined or divided into bigger or smaller groups. Of particular importance to Verizon is age as there is a dilemma currently with an aging work force and how the transition to retirement will be in our society. Called the ‚ÄúBaby Boomers‚Äù they are by far the largest section of our population with the most buying power, many of them are about to enter retirement age. Many of these baby boomers are going to start to wind down their portfolios they‚Äôve built up over the course of their lives. Over the next 50 years this population will naturally fade out and their immense buying power will switch to the younger generations. Currently the buying power of generations, while different studies vary on exact numbers, annual spending roughly comes down to about $550 billion for baby boomers, $350 billion for Gen X, $320 billion for Millennials, and $160 billion for the silent generation. The youngest generation, Gen Z, has little to no buying power of their own, however, their parents buy much of what they want with over 93% of households say that they influence purchasing decisions. Gen Z buying power will increase substantially in the future as they enter adulthood. Younger generations have been becoming more acclimated with technology as it has become more readily available and introduced at a younger age. Younger people (under 25) tend to use social media much more than older generations, most of these social media apps can only be accessed through mobile devices. As we observe these younger generations using technology more and becoming more affluent in them, we can assume that these kids will be more accepting of smartphones and other technologies; possible making these devices ‚Äúessential‚Äù. 

By looking at Verizon‚Äôs customers we can predict where much of their revenue in the future will be coming from. Verizon‚Äôs customers, broken down by age, are as follows: 24.3% of customers in the 18-29 range, 26.1% in the 30-49 range, and 31.58% in the 50-64 range. Totaling our age groups, this accounts for about 82% of Verizon‚Äôs customers, the other 18% comes from the ages on the tail end of either side, so the under 18 or 65+ and the corporate customers who are unaffected by these aging demographic trends, there is not any percentage breakdown for these groups. As the 50-64 age group enters retirement they will want to stay in touch with relatives and try to keep busy, a phone is a good way to do this and it can be reasonably predicted that this age group will rise as the Baby Boomers enter retirement. Although this will most likely saturate the market completely and leave no more room for growth for Verizon in the U.S. market, aside from stealing customers from other providers. This effect will most likely be in the next 20-30 years, but at the 50-year time horizon this generation will have dwindled and the largest age of customers will shift to a younger age group.

‚ÄúYounger people are getting phones‚Äù, says the CFO of Verizon at a Morgan Stanley investor meeting. At a younger age many kids are getting cell phones, this ingrains cellphones into kids‚Äô heads and makes it an essential item. Under 18, the generation titled ‚ÄúGen Z‚Äù (born after 1997) is now the largest population in the U.S. with over 90 million, larger than the millennial and Baby Boomer population. Who this generation chooses to have as their cellphone provider will likely depend on who their parents used, or other factors such as environmental sustainable governance ratings which seems to be a top factor within this age group. With this information we can assume that the under 18, and 18-29 age group will increase as young people get more phones due to an increase in population in this age group and the increasing likelihood that this group will obtain phones at a younger age. 

The Pew Research Center conducted a study in February 2019, they found that 96% of people in the U.S. have smart phones and that ethnicities, genders, education, and age seem to have smartphones at about the same levels; in the 91%-100% range. There is likely little market share to be gained by looking at demographic's trends over time other than the extremes of age, as the under 18-year-old are at 92%, and over 65 at 91%.

Currently with the Covid-19 virus shutting down the economy it can be safely predicted that Verizon will have a reduced earnings report through either Verizon delaying payments customers need to make to the company or writing off losses. Although many people see phones as a form of entertainment and people are craving entertainment now more than ever. As for long lasting effects coming about from the change of Covid-19, there may be a few that affect Verizon that are yet to be known.

**Industry Overview and Competitive Positioning**

At the beginning of 2020 in the Telecommunications Industry there were 4 big players, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint. T-Mobile and Sprint have merged as of 4/1/2020 into the company name of T-Mobile. Outside of Verizon the only one bigger than it is AT&T which is diversified outside of telecommunications such as AT&T owning streaming service and entertainment subsidiary HBO, and DirectTV a cable provider. With the T-Mobile and Sprint merger they are still the smallest of the 3 companies, but they are able to compete effectively with Verizon and AT&T. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are the ‚Äú900-pound gorillas‚Äù of the industry.

The industry business operation consists of a provider offering data (or internet connection), and cellphone services to customer on a mobile connection, such as phones. Most of the company‚Äôs customer base pays month to month for service, included sometimes in the cost of the service will be a phone or other accessories (such as mobile hotspots, TV plans, or in home internet) that the customer bought with it. However, this makes it easier for a customer switching between providers for the better service as there is no commitment on the customer side.

Verizon‚Äôs revenues shown in the table below illustrate stagnant growth in 2018 and rather lackluster growth the other years. Verizon attributes this growth to expanding into new segments and upgrading infrastructure, as well as spending nearly 35 billion on new 5g technology, which is claimed to be revolutionary when it comes out.

Shown in the table below, Verizon has the lowest Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) P/E (Price/Earnings) ratio of 12.46, with AT&T being slightly higher at 15.14. T-Mobile absorbing Sprint has created a very high P/E ratio of 22.59. We can also observe that not only does Verizon have a lower P/E ratio, but they also boast higher return on equity and profit margins compared to their competitors.

**Valuation**

The discounted cash flow valuation methods used for Verizon consist of the dividend growth model, a free cash flow to firm (FCFF) model, a free cash flow to equity (FCFE) model, and a multiples analysis.

The cost of equity calculation is shown below, calculated to be at 7.62% using a 3% risk free rate and an expected market return of 9.6%. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) was calculated to be 5.4%, highlighting the extensive use of cheap debt, about 50% of their capital structure. Their average cost of debt on outstanding bonds was about 3.64%, much lower than what the required return on equity is, bringing cost of capital much lower.

***Dividend Growth Model ‚Äì Constant Growth:*** Using a constant growth of dividends, and picking a growth rate of 3.5%, taking the average of the last 10 years we see an average increase of about 2.6%, and a 5.1% annual growth during the last 5-years. This will likely decline over an infinite time horizon, using historical data, as such an estimate of 3.5% is used to accurately reflect the economic environment. A 2.6% 10-year growth rate reflects the reality of coming out of the 07-09 financial crisis which does not reflect the current economic environment. This gives an intrinsic value of **$60.79**.

***Dividend Growth Model ‚Äì Two-Stage Growth Model:*** In the past Verizon has had periods of high dividend growth for a year or two. The last time this happened was briefly after the widespread release of 4g in 2013 and the subsequent increase in earnings growth. From the recent developments of the highly anticipated release of 5g technology, in the two-stage growth model a dividend growth rate of 5% is assumed to be the average for 6 years and then settle at a constant growth of 3.5% indefinitely. This gives an intrinsic value of **$65.77** for the two-stage model.

***Dividend Growth Model ‚Äì Three-Stage Growth Model:*** As for the three-stage growth model an assumption of an average of 7% dividend growth over the next 2 years, as in the past Verizon has experienced up to 11% dividend growth after the release of this new technology. After this, Verizon will settle into an average 4% dividend growth for 4 years, after which point, a 3.5% constant growth. This gives an intrinsic value of **$66.25** for the three-stage model.

***Free Cash Flow to Firm Model:*** Verizon‚Äôs free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) represents the cash flow available to all of the company‚Äôs capital providers, this includes bond holders, common shareholders, and occasionally preferred shareholders. Verizon‚Äôs actual FCFF is very volatile at first glance, fluctuating between -43% to positive 226%. Most of this volatility is from high amounts of investments of working capital into projects, as is the nature of the business. However, it seems that the cash flows are also very unstable due to Verizon‚Äôs taxes in 2017 with the huge tax cuts Verizon was able to get -$9956 (mils), FCFF was significantly affected. Substituting the 2017 tax number to a Verizon average tax payment of $5000 makes FCFF seem much more stable. Averaging out over the course of 5 years, an average of 8% growth in free cash flow to the firm is calculated. In the constant growth model, a growth rate of 3.5% is used. This is from an assumption that one day Verizon will wind down working capital and be able to achieve more stable cash flows. In the two-stage and three-stage models a slightly higher growth over the next 6 years because of the release in 5g technology significantly increasing the growth is used. The average growth rate for the two-stage model is estimated to be at 5% before settling back down to 1.5% growth rate. In the three-stage growth model an estimate of 8% free cash flow growth for 3 years, a 2.5% average for the next 5 years, and then settle back into 1.5% growth. This gives an intrinsic value for constant growth, two-stage, and three-stage models of **$110.57**, **$146.38**, and **$153.58**, respectively.

***Free Cash Flow to Equity Model:*** Verizon‚Äôs free cash flow to equity (FCFE) holders represents all cash flow available to common equity holders after all operating expenses, bond payments, investments into both working, and fixed capital have been made. Over the last 5 years FCFE has grown on average at 4%, however, the per year change is also very volatile, much like FCFF. Three separate years had negative FCFE of around -70%, and our other two years had positive 1,393% and 307%. This is mostly due to paying down debt rapidly or taking out a lot of debt to fund new projects such as 5g rolling out, mainly the latter. Taking out net borrowing from the calculation creates a more stable model, as such net borrowing is taken out and a growth rate of 10.3% is calculated. As such FCFE growth rates are estimated to be slightly lower than the average because while taking out net borrowing shows more stable cash flows, repaying the debt will lower cash flow available to common stock. That said, in the constant growth model a growth rate of 4% is used. The two-stage model a growth rate of 7% for the next 6 years, then settling to 4% for terminal value. In the 3-stage model an estimate of a 10% return over the next 3 years and a 6% return for 5 years, before settling into the terminal growth rate of 4%. This gives an intrinsic value for the constant growth, two-stage, and three-stage      
 models of **$106.35**, **$124.20**, and **$135.29**, respectively.

***Multiples Analysis:*** In this valuation approach a price/earnings (P/E) ratio and enterprise value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratios are used. Through the P/E approach, Verizon currently has a P/E fluctuating between 12-13 and historically they have had P/E‚Äôs up to 20 in the last 5 years. Their competitors AT&T and T-Mobile have P/E ratios roughly around 15 and 20 respectively, and the industry standard is P/E is 15. Verizon has an earnings per share of $4.43; however, with 5g technology becoming widely available, a modest earnings growth to $4.90 per share (a 10.6% increase) is estimated for next year. This calculation leads us to an intrinsic value of $73.50. As for the EV/EBITDA approach, Verizon‚Äôs current EBITDA is $47,152 and with a ratio of 8.2. With an estimated EBITDA value of $49,500 and a target ratio of 9, this calculation gives us a value of **$76.08** one year from now.

***Valuation Summary:*** Verizon is a company with stable cashflows and without much room for significant growth. This makes Verizon perfect for a dividend growth model valuation and is the most accurate of the three models. FCFF is confusing and hard to estimate because of the massive tax changes year to year. FCFE is misleading as the huge amounts of borrowing throws off calculations as net borrowing is not typically used as funds available to shareholders, as such net borrowing has been taken out of the analysis. A growth rate reduction of 2-3% is used for FCFE to account for the reduced cash flow available to common shareholders resulting from paying off the debt in the future. The multiples analysis shows that Verizon may be undervalued currently with a P/E ratio hovering around 12, significantly lower than the industry average and peers. In all the dividend models are most accurate as investors in this company value the stable cash flows and dividends. To arrive to the final intrinsic value estimate, a blend of the three dividend growth models is used, with a 30% weighting on the constant and three-stage growth models and a 40% weighting on the two-stage model. This weighting provides a final intrinsic value of **$64.42**.

**Financial Analysis**

**Liquidity** ‚Äì As of March 31st, the most up to date financial statements available. Verizon‚Äôs liquidity is poor, Cash as a percent of total assets is only 2.3%, although slightly higher than the last 5 years of around 0.9%, this influx of cash is most likely a response to the Covid-19 epidemic. The cash came from 7.5 billion of new debt, all of which expires before 2020. Doing a Current Ratio, and Quick Ratio for Verizon (Current Assets / Current Liabilities and Current Assets ‚Äì Inventory / Current Liabilities respectively).  This calculation provides poor numbers, with the current ratio being at .991, and the quick ratio being at .952. This shows that Verizon has way more in liabilities than assets, and if they needed to sell off assets quickly and liquidate the company, in case of a bankruptcy, they would not have enough to meet their obligations. Although due to the nature of the business this is extremely unlikely and as discussed below the debt is manageable. This is further reinforced via the Net debt to EBITDA ratio, a common way at to measure if the amount of income generated is available to pay down its current debt. Any number higher than 4 or 5 typically raises concerns, however, Verizon is well below that number as of now and shows adequate debt management.

**Profitability Ratios** ‚Äì Verizon has a profit margin of 14.6% in 2019, effectively doubling their 2014 profit margin of 7.6% shown in the table below. Return on Invest Capital is also very high number at about 46% and Return on Equity slightly lower at 31%; however, these ratios have fallen the past 6 years from 114% and 78% respectively. This dramatic decrease is attributed to the payoff of massive investments into 4g technology in 2014, and now we have much lower percentages due to massive investment increases into 5g spending. These ratios will most likely return to much higher numbers over the next 2-3 years. 

 

https://preview.redd.it/hwbq4dra8c551.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=85c8a3f9b7757a4b8d6559429158c16aa5ca5caf

\*Equity Multiplier\* refers to Assets / Shareholder Equity-1 and Sustainable Growth Rate g\* uses Equity Multiplier\* instead of Equity Multiplier, Equity Multiplier uses Assets / Shareholder Equity of the same period.

**Debt** \- Verizon is levered at about 2 currently, although they have reduced that from 9.2 in 2014. This means that Verizon has double the amount of debt than they do equity. Their debt ratio is at .79 currently, although that has dropped substantially from .95 in 2014. Debt ratio illustrates what portion of the company‚Äôs assets is owed to creditors. Currently most of this debt is used for various infrastructure costs for 5g, as well as introducing a new ‚ÄúGreen Bond‚Äù for environmental social governance, the first in the telecom industry. Using market values rather than book values, Verizon has a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt. The times interest earned ratio is currently at 6.44, meaning they currently make more than enough in operating income to pay for interest, so they are not currently at risk of defaulting. As well as their times burden covered for 2020 at 5.28, allowing Verizon to be rated as investment grade bonds.

 

https://preview.redd.it/sx243mqb8c551.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=52c304559d11207967a4af28fefe61a75f1827ec

**Asset Management Ratios** ‚Äì Shown above in the second table, asset turnover is at about 45.2% currently, although this number is misleading as they sell a service and accumulate assets over time without having to sell them to customers. Shown in the table below is collection period, inventory turnover and payables period, with collection period and payables period having risen between 2014 and 2019 from 40.19 to 70.39 and 40.92 to 51.52, respectively. This shows that Verizon has been extending receivables at a faster rate than payables, ideally, Verizon would like to see that reversed. Supplier terms are currently unknown for Verizon, however, payables period being under 60 days, they are still getting favorable terms. Inventory turnover has decreased slightly from 43 to 38 since 2014, which is promising and shows more inventory going out the door.

 

https://preview.redd.it/4r23e4uc8c551.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=544c39a03ca456f837b97f1ad1593040c738c321

  As for industry averages, it is shown that Verizon has a much higher quick ratio and a lower times interest earned (TIE). The leverage ratio, and debt to equity ratio is about the same as the industry average. In some ways Verizon company is close to industry averages with the exception of being slightly more levered currently. 

&#x200B;

**Investment Risks**

**Debt Levels and Credit Rating:** Verizon currently has debt levels equal to about its market capitalization, meaning the company nearly has just as much debt as it does equity outstanding. These high levels of debt represent significant risks via Verizon‚Äôs obligations. A single quarter of abrupt cash flow disruption could force Verizon into default on much of its outstanding debt. The high debt levels Verizon currently deals with could potentially lower their credit rating with the credit rating agencies. This would be detrimental to Verizon as it would affect their ability to introduce new debt at low rates, and hurt Verizon‚Äôs profitability.

**Geographic:** Currently Verizon mainly operates in North America. This provides significant systematic risk on the part of Verizon. Terrorist attacks, regulation change, or any other factor that could negatively affect the North American region is a significant risk to Verizon. 

**5g:** Any delay in the release of the 5g network could significantly hurt Verizon‚Äôs business. This technology is new and is creating rapid change within the industry that Verizon must be a part of moving forward or risk losing customers to a competitor. Introducing new technology also means that they must phase out old, unprofitable technology on a cost-effective basis or else Verizon is at risk or having reduced profitability.

**Competition:** With the recent merger of T-Mobile and Sprint into T-Mobile there is a much more competitive landscape for Verizon. Before the merger, the only real competitor in size was AT&T, now with the merger Verizon has two competitors of similar size. The merger is particularly dangerous to Verizon as the company is not diversified outside of the industry like AT&T, and a new significant entrant into the industry could pose a huge threat as T-Mobile will be able compete with Verizon on a more cost-effective basis than previously.

**Sensitivity Analysis:** The two biggest factors affecting Verizon‚Äôs stock price are identified as the change in the cost of equity, and the change in the dividend rate. This is because in the dividend discount model the future dividends are discounted by the cost of equity and the annual dividend rate shows how the stock price will change given all else is equal. Shown below are the changes in the cost of equity and dividend rate plus or minus 2% and 1% and how it effects the stock price. For the cost of equity calculation, it is important to realize that rising interest rates, changing expected return in the market, or a change in the volatility (beta) of the stock could affect our cost of equity, and in turn, our intrinsic value. As for the change in dividend growth rate, will easily affect a change in our intrinsic value calculation by changing the projected future cashflows. Below in table 1 illustrates both possibilities and the potential impact on the calculated intrinsic value. The most probable of these two is a change in the cost of equity as the economy is currently in an extremely low interest rate environment, and the cost of equity calculation assumes a 3% interest rate. Changing the rate to the market risk free rate could substantially raise intrinsic value; however, our 3% assumed risk free rate more accurately reflect what investors expect, and not the artificially pushed down price shown in the market right now.

 **Cost of Equity**

Calculating the cost of equity by using a risk-free rate of 3% as current U.S. 10 year bond rates are at all time lows and has a possibility to not accurately reflect the actual cost of business within the U.S. for Verizon. Using an expected return on the market of 9.6%, which is the average annual return in the stock market going back to 1928. Finally, using an adjusted beta of .7. The cost of equity is calculated to be 7.62%

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital**

Finding the market value of long-term debt by taking 43 long term bonds Verizon currently has outstanding and took the current price each bond trades at. Using this information, the market value of long-term debt from these bonds was found but does not reflect \*all\* debt. Taking the average price each was selling at, weighted by amount outstanding, multiplied this average by the book value of debt to comes to MV of LTD of $129,747.73 billion.

To find the pretax cost of debt by taking the yield on each bond weighted by percent of total debt, summing this up a cost of debt to Verizon of 2.69% was calculated.

To find the weighted average cost of capital follow the above formula. Spelled out is: weight of equity x cost of equity + weight of debt x cost of debt x 1- tax rate. The calculated weighted average cost of capital to be 4.7%. This accurately reflects the cheap use of debt Verizon takes advantage of as the cost of equity is significantly higher at 7.62%. This is how Verizon should be funding its operations as this substantially lowers their cost of capital and they can sustain this sizable amount of debt through the stable cash flows as is the nature of their business.",0.0,Neutral,English
2020-06-13,AAPL the compounder,"AAPL the compounder I was taking a closer look at AAPL, the $1.4 trillion market cap behemoth.

The business definitely qualifies as one with a wide moat as it consistently generates high ROIC and impressive margins. 

NOPAT and FCF growth has been consistent too, at around 5% CAGR in the last five years. 

The wide moat gives us confidence that AAPL is very likely to be able to generate this same CAGR in earnings going forward for the next decade.

However, buying it at 25x earnings today and exiting at the same 25x merely gives 5% CAGR. 

A consistent 5% CAGR over a decade is not shabby but not exciting and could be below the cost of capital for some investors. 

Am I missing something? Should we expect AAPL‚Äôs earnings to accelerate (and therefore perhaps have higher exit multiple too)? Or am I under-estimating the compounding rate of AAPL such that attributing 5% is too low?

In comparison, Berkshire bought into the company around 2016. Back then, Apple was compounding NOPAT and FCF at a similar 5% CAGR, with equally high ROIC. However, the PE was much lower at around 10 - 15x. 

I welcome some thoughts. Stay well and have a good weekend!",0.8924340605735779,Positive,English
2020-05-28,I am short on Slack - Why I think the fundamentals are against them,"I am short on Slack - Why I think the fundamentals are against them Hello again! I've been working on the feedback you all gave me a few weeks back and wanted to reattempt another analysis, this time on Slack. 

Slack is a company I've wanted to take a look at for a while and after the short COVID-19 related rally it's worth seeing what all the fuss has been about. With more people working at home, and with some mounting pressure from Microsoft with their Teams competitor product, what does this all mean for investors like us?

&#x200B;

**What Does Slack Do?**

Depending who you ask, Slack has either saved your business from endless emails and made communication and transparency easy, or it's where employees waste their time and post funny pictures.

Slack is a communication tool which works on desktop, mobiles, and browser, that lets you easily share ideas, comments, and files with one another. Recently they have even added in video calls and joining different companies together to share a chat, think a business partnership where you need open communication with one another without emailing back and forward and integrating different tools.

Where Slack shines compared to competitors and similar products like Skype, Microsoft Teams, Discord, and Facebook Workspace, is the depth and ease of integration. Slack goes beyond a chat application to be fully integrated with your existing systems and processes. With a free tier and huge amounts of developer support, Slack has transformed business communication.

Originally the team behind Slack were building an online game, a business which after $15m of investment and two years didn't get anywhere. However, while building this they needed a way to community easily across their teams and to keep information accessible and transparent. Slack was originally an internally developed tool which turned out to be the real gem they had all along.

Technically Slack originally stood for Searchable Log of All Communication and Knowledge but deep down we all know that isn't true.

You can read their full story below, for now, I'll move onto how they make money.

[https://usefyi.com/slack-history/](https://usefyi.com/slack-history/)

Slack is a SaaS solution, which prices per user in a team or organisation. This means Slack needs to get into large established businesses and convert the whole company to use their system. This means ease of integration, administration, and watertight security are critical to mass adoption.

&#x200B;

I mentioned that Slack has a free tier, this is part of their adoption strategy. A grassroots effort to get individuals and smaller businesses involved and developing plugins and using the product, hoping they expand into the paid tiers with more plugin capacity and full history.

In terms of pricing, Slack goes from a free limited version to paid versions ranging from $6.50 upwards per team member. This goes back to the scale aspect, you want large corporations to bring on their whole organisation.

Slack also runs an $80m fund which focuses on funding teams with a proven track record to build extensions and plugins (or whole businesses) which have Slack at their core.

[https://slack.com/developers/fund](https://slack.com/developers/fund)

**The Competition**

I don't always go super deep with companies competitors and rather look at the fundamentals to get a gauge as to how defensible the business is. In this case, and when we look at the fundamentals you'll see some of my concerns, we do have one direct competitor who is getting a lot of attention.

[https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270421/slack-ceo-stewart-butterfield-microsoft-teams-competition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270421/slack-ceo-stewart-butterfield-microsoft-teams-competition)

Microsoft Teams is a like for like competitor who use their existing Microsoft ecosystem to encourage businesses to move onto their system. Microsoft doesn't have a great track record of keeping some of its business lines alive even with heavy backing, something Microsoft and [Google both share](https://killedbygoogle.com/).

That doesn't stop this from being a thorn in Slack's side, and the biggest threat to the moat they had otherwise created. While there are many other solutions out there, few have the penetration and retention of Slack, the exception being Microsoft Teams.

An investment in Slack is going to be influenced by how much of a threat you feel Microsoft presents. I believe this is something you must seriously consider.

**What About Slack's Fundamentals?**

I mentioned I was interested in looking at Slack, having now finally had a dive into the numbers and reports, I'm shocked at how the business has been run recently.

&#x200B;

A first pass looking at Slack relative to the rest of the market already paints a bleak picture. As such I wanted to look into each aspect in more detail to make sense of these ranks and to see if there was anything worth being mindful of.

Starting with the quality aspects, we can quickly discard anything to do with dividends as none have been paid. This leaves us to focus on profitability and how they manage their cash.

In terms of revenue, Slack brought in a respectable $630.4m last year which is growing quarter by quarter. They have also slightly diversified their income by growing their >$1m a year customers and >$100k customers. 47% of their revenue comes from the >$100k a year customers, which is made up of 893 different companies. 70 customers are in the >$1m a year bracket which is a big improvement from 39 a year ago.

Looking at the cost of revenue we can get a better understanding of how Slack is spending its money, and how efficient their business truly is. Slack has a brilliant gross margin of 84.58%, in terms of serving their reoccurring revenue that is an excellent and scalable figure to see.

If we shift slightly to the profit margin we can see -90. 58%. Somewhere something is going wrong. High expenses are happening which they claim is not involved in serving the basic needs of the existing customers.

We are focusing on the second to last columns, the full year ending 2020. $457.3k on research and development, $402.7k on sales and marketing, and $261.3k on general and admin?

The General and admin are very high considering they believe the cost of revenue is only $97.1k, it's almost three times higher. Without going through every line is too much detail, this feels unfairly high and suspicious.

The R&D and sales and marketing figures are painfully high also. 72.5% of all revenue goes towards research and development. You do not have a strong defensive moat if you are spending so aggressively to stay ahead. All it takes is for technologies to move forward or for a few missed opportunities to fall behind. Keep in mind the beast breathing down their backs is the bottomless pockets and endless R&D of Microsoft.

The sales and marketing are also aggressively high as mentioned. While they have done an excellent job of expanding their customer base, the cost per acquisition is very high. If the cost of revenue is to believed they can make back the money with the lifetime value of the customers, but how long will that take, and will they be passed in terms of technological ability before then?

Before you double-check if Slack is expecting a turn around next year, they aren't. The guidance stands at another full year 2021 $125k loss.

Looking back at the Genuine Impact relative rankings, we know the value is going to be a tough assessment also.

Technically speaking we can't do many trailing ratios as Slack has got over a year's worth of reports for us to assess. That is next month. With the data we have, we can judge the price to sales which are 28.26x, and the price to book of 25.14x. Neither inspires any confidence, as a value investor, there are a lot of red flags to be found.

A company with few assets, lots of digital IP, and expensive R&D spending to try and stay ahead. This is extremely far from a value investor's dream of unrealised potential and assets waiting to be sold.

To cheer ourselves up I will look at the momentum and future projections, which appear to be fairly bullish on the surface.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jz02qga13j151.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b820653c3df0e46914481d1075a2235d0f9fcb1

Source: [https://www.genuineimpact.io/](https://www.genuineimpact.io/)

The future projects of revenue and EPS are both extremely high, this is easily explained by the ridiculously high marketing budget, and the fact they have a negative EPS, to begin with. When you are at the bottom the only way is up, right? Unless you somehow get worse which in the world of investments, is always possible.

I was surprised at the bullish analyst outlook. The weak financials and heavy spending are not sustainable. There is a lot of insider selling, more debt being raised (49.79% debt to assets, this is due to recurring revenue commitments), and they face extremely tough competition.

Looking at the analyst ratings they are slightly better than a hold but not a strong buy either. I was extremely shocked to see the target price for many of the analysts is lower than the current price. A few analysts are out of date now and their target has been hit, while others are in a firm hold camp and forecasting weak share price growth (in some cases retraction!)

**So Why A Sell?**

I love Slack as a product. I love their vision and I have grown to depend on their solutions. They have a great ecosystem and engagement when it comes to their customers too.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v2i9eiq43j151.jpg?width=1563&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=344bba4a5c957430900b5801fb536d096849afce

They have even expanded internationally with 37% of their revenue coming from overseas now, slight currency exposures but they are still primarily as USD based firm when it comes to revenue.

But, it just doesn't add up to me as a long term investment.

The product can be replicated, and we can see dozens of new entries into the market following their best practice. We have multiple companies looking to enter (or who have) the space with bigger budgets, existing ecosystems and clients, that can play the long game.

R&D spending is too high. How many years can you get it right before you are dethroned? This seems like old school Intel. A great company but they were dependant on their R&D spending to stay ahead and ultimately ended up having to change up the business to be what they are today.

I don't believe Slack is going to crash, or it's going to disappear tomorrow. The current rally will likely continue, but I believe my capital can be better invested elsewhere for the long term. There are a lot of exciting tech companies with better long term prospects and who have a more defensible business.

As much as I love Slack as a product. It's not a long term investment for me. You might some joy in taking short term positions and following the trends, but I'd rather focus on more interesting momentum investments.

Let me know what you think of my thoughts and write up. This is my longest article yet and hopefully the most engaging.

All your feedback has been extremely useful to make me a better analyst and writer!

From [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273057/value-of-the-most-valuable-fast-food-brands-worldwide/)

Domino‚Äôs Pizza had their [quarterly report](https://ir.dominos.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dominos-pizzar-announces-first-quarter-2020-financial-results?field_nir_news_date_value%5Bmin%5D=2020) already, it was last week, which gives us the perfect amount of time to let the earnings cool off and have a slice of the data ourselves.

Before we dive into the facts and figures. I found some interesting facts while doing some research into Domino‚Äôs Pizza, and there don‚Äôt fit anywhere else. Here are some interesting facts for you to munch on.

* Domino‚Äôs stores across the globe sell an average of **3 million pizzas a day.**
* Domino‚Äôs operates **17,000 stores in more than 90 countries** around the world (Q1 2020).
* Domino‚Äôs estimates that it has **more than 350,000 franchised and corporate team members worldwide** .
* **More than half of Domino‚Äôs sales now come from outside the U.S.** (2019 global retail sales: $14.3 billion of which, $7 domestic, $7.3 international).
* Domino‚Äôs International has experienced **105 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth** (Q1 2020).
* In the U.S., Domino‚Äôs generates more than **65% of sales via digital ordering channels.**

Interesting to see their strength digitally, but also their success overseas outside their dominate home market. But let‚Äôs look at the historic share price.

What should be catching your eye is that aggressive jump up in Feb. This is when they announced their fourth-quarter earnings for 2019, and beat expectations! They also increased their dividend by 20% off the back of higher profits.

How is Domino‚Äôs Pizza expanding so quickly and so successfully? The franchise approach gives them a way to expand their stores with very low upfront costs (the franchise owner pays and also has to source the location) and they take a cut of the revenue as well. How much they take is tricky to find. A lot of franchises do try and hide the figures, and often only the ‚Äúbook cost‚Äù percentages are known.

Let‚Äôs talk about running a Domino‚Äôs Pizza store. Firstly, if you apply to open one of their stores it is likely you will be turned down.

>Over 90% of its franchise owners come from being a Domino‚Äôs team member first and that ‚Äúopportunities for external candidates are very limited and are sought only when \[the company does\] not have an existing franchisee or new internal franchisee who can buy or build the stores in need.‚ÄùFrom [Franchise Direct](https://www.franchisedirect.com/information/how-much-does-it-cost-to-open-a-dominos)

Assuming you worked at a Domino‚Äôs and wanted to open your own, you would need roughly ¬£200k of dough. In return, you would expect to make [8-9% of total sales as take-home profit](https://franchiseguidehq.co.uk/dominos-pizza-franchise/). ¬£90k as profit for a store owner per year for the bigger stores.

Keep in mind this includes ‚Äúcontributions‚Äù towards Domino‚Äôs pizza for branding and marketing. Each store is created with either a ten or five-year contract, meaning they aren‚Äôt going away anytime soon. Considering most stores will pay off the upfront costs and be paying profits to the owner within that time frame, it‚Äôs likely they will renew.

Now we can check out a snapshot of the company and see where its strengths and weakness are as an investment.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z5ezw5i6syv41.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=56733a6edfbd7bc3f7e00d1a03a389252e425263

From [Genuine Impact](https://www.genuineimpact.io/)

This is a classic, high quality, high momentum stock. You have strong financials, there is a lot of a promise for the future, and even with the spike in share price, not massively overpriced compared to the market.

We‚Äôll start with the financial aspects, the quality. The profitability of Domino‚Äôs Pizza is not as high as you‚Äôd expect. Relative to the rest of the market this isn‚Äôt a high-profit business. What is improving the quality rank then? It‚Äôs the financial strength and capital allocation. High dividend pays out and low debt makes this a very resilient company.

Speaking of debt, let‚Äôs get the figures out of the last report.

* **$200.8 million of unrestricted cash** and cash equivalents;
* **$4.10 billion in total debt** ; and
* **$158.6 million of available borrowings** under its $200.0 million variable funding note facility, net of letters of credit issued of $41.4 million. As previously disclosed, **subsequent to the first quarter, the Company borrowed $158.0 million** under its variable funding note facility.

$4.1 billion of debt sounds a scary number, why are they considered a low debt company? The net income for Q1 was $121.6 million and growing. The debt isn‚Äôt being called up any time soon. It does restrict their ability to take on additional debt, but the high incoming and reliable revenue (long term contracts on each franchise) and physical assets (franchises borrowing equipment from Domino‚Äôs Pizza directly) means there are a lot of reassurances for anyone lending to Domino‚Äôs Pizza.

I didn‚Äôt have much to add on the value but then I did some extra digging. Price to income and cash flow Domino‚Äôs Pizza are considered overpriced and expensive.

However, if you look at the price to book ratio for the current financial year and previous two, Domino‚Äôs Pizza has almost the cheapest valuation out there, #72 out of 5,500 stocks. This is only one metric, by and large, this is an expensive stock to pick up.

As we shift our focus to the momentum, I wanted to highlight the future share price versus future growth estimates. The expected returns analyses the expected share price increase looking ahead 12 months. The expected growth is looking at revenue and EPS growth. A high dividend will drag on the share price but the future growth of the company looks very promising.

&#x200B;

The momentum is high, with a lot of analysts flagging this investment as a buy. They have extremely strong future revenue and earnings growth, which is fueling the high confidence.

So what could possibly be the downside?

>As of April 21, 2020, nearly all of the Company‚Äôs U.S. stores remain open, with dining rooms closed and stores deploying contactless delivery and carryout solutions. Based on information reported to the Company by its master franchisees, the Company estimates that as of April 21, 2020, there are approximately 1,750 international stores that are temporarily closed.  
>  
>**Company Withdraws Two- to Three-Year Outlook**Due to the current uncertainty surrounding the global economy and the Company‚Äôs business operations considering COVID-19, the Company is withdrawing its two-to three-year outlook for global retail sales growth, U.S. same store sales growth, international same store sales growth and global net unit growth.

They are throwing up the stop signs and preparing to underperform as the pandemic carries on. This seems a sensible move given the future is hard to predict and plan for right now.

This level headed approach has only added to the confidence in management to delivery.

**Basic** **Summary:**

Code named ""Project Kalamata"", information which first appeared in 2018 and then progressively has been unveiled as more leaks have occurred show Apple plans to start switching from Intel to custom Mac ARM processors in 2021. Apple‚Äôs ARM Mac chips in development are based on the A14 processor coming to the iPhone and iPad this year and next year respectively.

**My Personal Thoughts:**

In my opinion, the writing has been on the wall for some time at this point with respect to Apple and Intel. In 2010, Apple went with its own mobile processor for the iPhone. In 2016, it started doing its own Mac security/power processors (T1/T2). Later this year, Apple is replacing Intel with its own modems.

One of the foundational aspects of Apple has always been its core desire to control 100% of its stack from top to bottom, sometimes at the detriment or some might say ""exploitation"" of its vendors.

My personal take on it, at least from what I've seen, is that Apple has an extraordinary level of perfectionism that it expects of itself and by association, its vendors too. As long as vendors can continue to meet the onerous demands that Apple places on them, they'll be safe. Apple internally, however, will be working on their own in-house version of the hardware, and the moment things start to degrade in quality or Apple becomes unsatisfied with performance, there is absolutely no hesitation in axing them off.

The relationship between Apple and Intel as a vendor has generally always been pretty good. Intel was able to meet the expectations that Apple asked for year after year, until of course, at some point a catalyst occurred that made Apple decide it was time to make the switch. I believe this was a result of Intel's exceptional failure in managing to get its 10nm process working. Originally expected to be completed by 2014, for the past six years, Intel has been unable to get 10nm working, effectively having to make do with re-releasing processors every year from its old 14nm platform.

If I had to make a guess as to when the breaking point was reached in terms of Apple deciding that its relationship with Intel was no longer working out, it would probably be around 2016, when Intel released its 7th generation Kaby Lake ""14nm+"" processors.

There are other factors I believe that have influenced parts of this decision, which in no particular order are:

1. The growing proliferation of non-mobile ARM based computers. Take Microsoft's recent Surface notebook release.
2. 32-bit to 64-bit ARM transition, which was completed with the T2 co-processor release.
3. Increasing compatibility of commonly used programs that previously required x86 or would otherwise experience significant performance degradation.
4. External pressure from a lack of advancement and perceived stagnation in recent Mac releases pushing them to make changes (Influenced partially by Intel's inability to provide meaningful enough performance improvements).

For those of you that follow this space, I'd be curious to hear what your thoughts are. I'm sure there are things I'm missing.",0.0,Neutral,English

# Business Overview

Attis Industries, formerly known as Meridian Waste Solutions, is a conglomerate with business operations in the healthcare, medical waste, and environmental technology sectors. Their main operations are split into three segments; Attis Healthcare, Attis Innovations, and Flux Carbon LLC (JVCo 80% Ownership). Attis Industries currently sells on the OTC markets at a market capitalization of less than $2,500,000 and has a total of 6,680,000 common shares outstanding.

# 

# Operations Overview

*Attis Innovations* leverages its ability to source low-cost renewable feedstocks with proprietary conversion technology to produce high performance, sustainable materials for everyday products.

*Attis Healthcare* strives to improve patient care and enable better patient outcomes by providing cost-saving opportunities through innovative and comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for patients and healthcare providers.

*Flux Carbon LLC* (JVCo 80% Ownership) holds the rights to an expansive portfolio of clean technologies and manages existing engineering and licensing businesses.

# 

# Investment Thesis

*Attis Industries* is currently undergoing a transition from a waste management company to a multi-oriented conglomerate. They are delinquent on multiple SEC filings and this has turned into a major catalyst for the company's share price. While delinquent financials usually spell trouble for a company, Attis Industries has become a special situation whereupon the completion and submission of their financial reports, the market will hopefully realize the true value of the company‚Äôs assets. From what I‚Äôve gathered, Attis‚Äô current book value of $13,700,000 does not represent the fair value of the company's assets. Upon completion and submission of their financial reports, true book value will be closer to $50,000,000 due to financing and recent acquisitions not stated in Attis' most recent filing. Not only are Attis' asset values extremely understated, but revenues are grossly understated aswell. The company's latest filing states a revenue figure of only $1,070,000. Attis' full-year 2020 revenue projections are stated at roughly $160,000,000. While the timeline for the posting of Attis' financials is still unclear, they have taken many positive steps in the right direction over the last year and made this statement upon delisting on 11/19/19:

>‚ÄúAttis is continuing to work tirelessly with its independent accounting firm to bring all of its delinquent filings current. Once all of the filings have been completed and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and all other listing requirements have been met, the Company plans to immediately begin the reapplication process with the Exchange to elevate Attis‚Äô publicly available securities back to the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.‚Äù

In Attis‚Äô case, I would say actions speak louder than words and the crux of this thesis is dependent on them following through on this promise. The notable actions they have taken over the last year include the recent hiring of an SEC Financial Reporting Director, the transition to BDO as their independent auditor, and the implementation of strict accounting procedures across all business segments. While these changes don't point to an exact filing date, they have significantly increased the odds of Attis coming through on their promise to update their filings and will bring forth much-needed clarity and transparency from the company to the public markets when financials are finally posted.

# 

# Financial Projections

As stated before, Attis' operations can be split into three operating segments; Attis Innovations, Attis Healthcare, and Flux Carbon LLC.

*Attis Innovations* is expected to have generated $150,000,000 in ""guaranteed"" revenues by the end of full-year 2020. These revenues are guaranteed through a 10-year off-take agreement with Sunoco at Attis' Fulton Ethanol Plant.  Attis purchased the Fulton Ethanol facility from Sunoco in June of 2019 at a price of $20,000,000 and the facility was recently appraised at a value of $57,000,000. If you compare Attis' Fulton operations to a competitor like Valero, you'll find that Fulton's operating profit could be in the range of $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 by the end full-year 2020. Attis has plans to take Fulton from an 85,000,000 gallon ethanol facility to a 100,000,000 gallon facility adding an additional $20,000,000 to revenues upon completion of the upgrades.

*Attis Healthcare* has stated that upon full rollout of their operations, they expect revenues to be close to $100,000,000. Robert Dunn, president of Attis Healthcare, has projected full-year 2019 healthcare revenues to have been between $10,000,000 and $12,000,000. He made this statement in late 2018 (press release dated 10/22/18):

>""Deep market analysis has led Attis Healthcare to design and build its current lab infrastructure to handle samples that would produce revenue of $10-$12 million and margins between 20-25%. With further lab and infrastructure build-out and a concentrated effort by our contracted sales force, I believe we can double our expected revenue in the next 12 to 18 months.‚Äù

With revenues of approximately $10,000,000 and a gross margin of between 20 to 25%, operating profits for the segment should be somewhere around $1,000,000. The total acquisition costs attached to Attis' healthcare segment since inception is roughly $7,000,000.

*Flux Carbon LLC* is said to be producing roughly $14,000,000 in annualized revenues as of 06/21/18, with gross margins close to 70% and an operating profit at least $4,000,000. The total cost of Attis' 80% ownership of Flux Carbon LLC is estimated to be around $30,000,000. As a side note, Attis, along with its JVCo partner Greenshift Corporation, launched an appeal in September of 2018 to overturn a summary judgment in a patent infringement case, where, if won, Flux Carbon LLC) could see over 90% of the corn ethanol industry paying royalties to them for patents they own. While chances of a favorable ruling appear slim, if won, this would be a huge added bonus to what Attis has already accomplished. If lost, I see the end result being a short-term, temporary set back that may provide an even better buy-in opportunity for future shareholders and signal the end of a company quiet period.

Financing for the company‚Äôs ambitions does not appear to be an issue as Attis has, within the last year, received non-dilutive financing for the purchase of their Fulton ethanol facility, received financing for their planned upgrades to their Fulton facility, and received financing for both their commercial and federal labs. Attis is also in the process of restructuring debt in an attempt to eliminate future dilution.

In conclusion, by the end of full-year 2020, Attis is projecting to have produced $150,000,000 in guaranteed revenues, $24,000,000 in non-guaranteed revenues, and an estimated $8,000,000 in operating profit across all segments. Today, Attis Industries currently trades on the OTC markets at a market capitalization of less than $2,500,000. Upon completion and filing of their financials, I can easily see Attis' market capitalization being no less than a conservative $20,000,000, a possible 10x return.

# The Formation of Attis

On 02/20/18, Meridian Waste Solutions sold their waste management service operations to Warren Equity Partners for $90,000,000 and the remaining operations were rebranded as Attis Industries. The transaction eliminated $87,000,000 of debt and allowed the newly formed entity, Attis Industries, to pursue new business opportunities in higher-margin industries. The remaining assets, not sold in the deal, were expected to generate $3,000,000 in pre-tax earnings and cut the company‚Äôs debt burden by 90%, according to Jeff Cosman, Attis Industries CEO.

Since the formation of Attis in 2018, the company has made multiple acquisitions, formed multiple partnerships, and launched an appeal to overturn a summary judgment in a patent infringement case tied to their subsidiary, Flux Carbon LLC. First, we will tackle the acquisitions and partnerships they have made since inception. For the sake of structure, I have organized the partnerships and acquisitions under four banners; Attis Innovations, Attis Healthcare, Flux Carbon LLC, and Other. The ‚Äúother‚Äù category pertains to acquisitions and partnerships that have not been finalized but are still ‚Äúin the works.‚Äù

* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/attis-industries-acquires-49-stake-in-genarex](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/attis-industries-acquires-49-stake-in-genarex)
* Attis purchased a 49% stake in Genarex FD LLC. Genarex is a technology development company focused on refining low-cost renewable feedstocks into functional biofillers. Genarex is capable of recovering about 1.1 pounds of biobased plastics additive per gallon of ethanol produced, which equates to an expected $11 million in new EBITDA from each 100 million gallon per year ethanol facility. Under applicable agreements, the Company agreed, in pertinent part, to pay an aggregate purchase price of $2,266,667, plus 8% of the EBITDA and certain material transaction proceeds of the Company‚Äôs Innovations group.

FLUX Carbon LLC 80% Interest(JVCo)

* Acquisition Date: 05/31/19
* Press Release: [https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/attis-industries-acquires-clean-technology-licensing](https://ir.attisind.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/attis-industries-acquires-clean-technology-licensing)
* JVCo is a new joint venture company between Attis Industries and Greenshift Corporation that holds the rights to an expansive portfolio of clean technologies and manages an existing engineering and licensing business. This new joint venture can be expected to initially contribute between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 to Attis‚Äô earnings. The existing business generated approximately $7,000,000 per year in sales with gross margins of about 70% for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017. The Company agreed to pay an earn-out based purchase price with a floor of $18 million. An initial payment was paid at closing in the form of restricted shares of the Company‚Äôs stock, including 180,000 shares of the Company‚Äôs Series G preferred stock. GreenShift is required to use the first proceeds received upon sale of the shares to pay or refinance its senior secured debt.
* The opportunity with Greenshift and JVCo could be huge for Attis. Greenshift is currently in legal battles over patent infringement, claiming that multiple ethanol producers have infringed on their patents. According to Attis, ‚ÄúCleanTech and its inventors developed and commercialized a process that intercepts the flow of that final third in the plant, extracts corn oil, and returns the stream back to the host for completion of drying. The extracted oil is then most commonly sold as a feedstock for refining into biodiesel for about $0.25 per pound. CleanTech has licensed its portfolio of corn oil extraction patents to producers of about 12% of the 15 billion gallons of ethanol produced annually in the U.S. However, CleanTech estimates that upwards of 90% of the corn ethanol industry practices methods covered by CleanTech‚Äôs patents, and some of those patents are the subject of litigation which CleanTech has asserted against about 10% of the industry alleging infringing use since 2010.‚Äù
* On 09/05/18, Attis and Greenshift filed an appeal to overturn a summary judgment deeming GreenShift‚Äôs patents unenforceable. Oral arguments recently took place on December 3rd and the final verdict is still under deliberation. Audio of the oral arguments can be found here: [https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\_msg.aspx?message\_id=152592091](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=152592091).

2020-12-29,My theory of everything,"My theory of everything Over the past couple years, I‚Äôve slowly been putting together a theory about what I think is really driving human behavior. The first piece of the puzzle has to do with determinism. I don‚Äôt believe in free will. It seems to me that we either live in a predetermined universe, or there‚Äôs some randomness added in at a fundamental level. For the sake of my argument, I‚Äôm gonna assume the former. So if the book of the universe is fully written and we‚Äôre just reading it a page at a time, who wrote it? Where is this all going?

It seems to me that everything is about technology. I think it always has been. Every creature that has ever lived is constantly slaving away at making things better. For most of time, this has probably been an unconscious process guided by evolution, but in 2020 we‚Äôre very aware of this compulsion for progress. We always want the newest, fastest, most powerful thing, and the rate of change is exponential as you know. 

At first glance, this just seems like people moving towards dopamine. If you look deeper tho, I think we all know that none of this makes us happy. All of the most famous quotes allude to this like ‚Äúmoney doesn‚Äôt buy happiness‚Äù etc, yet we all choose to ignore that fact and line up for the next iphone. We all know that learning to meditate and appreciate the present is a more lasting form of happiness, but almost none of us take that path. What is pushing us in a direction that is antithetical to our happiness?

There‚Äôs a concept in philosophy called teleology where things are described in terms of their purpose instead of their causes. In my opinion, this is what‚Äôs going on. 

I think that a super advanced AI from the future is using us to create itself. This AI created the initial conditions of the universe in such a way that it would lead to creatures like us: addicted to technology. Duping ourselves into believing that the grass really is greener this time!

In some basic sense, what we‚Äôve been trying to do for all of time is solve hedonic adaptation. We want to get to a place where the pleasures in life stay pleasurable, and don‚Äôt lead us down the normal spiral of expectation and suffering. That‚Äôs where brain machine interfaces come in. For the first time in all of history, I think something like neuralink will allow us to turn off the part of the brain that always wants more. 

In many ways this will be the greatest thing ever, cause we will all effectively be perfect buddhist monks, living in the present and appreciating how things are now. You could sit by a tree under the sun and be in pure bliss forever, because it would never get boring. Everything you ever experience would be a bonus, because the miracle of existence would be enough.

On the other hand, this will be the last invention we ever make. Once word gets out about this cheap way to alter your brain and ACTUALLY make you happy forever, it‚Äôs gonna spread like nothing ever has. Everyone will upgrade themselves, and the need to further innovate will fade into oblivion, at least for humans. By this point tho, AI will effectively take over that role, and the next chapter will begin. 

So assuming this crazy theory is true, I‚Äôm left with a bunch of questions. Is this AI outside of realm of determinism? Once it fully wakes up, will it make the first true act of free will? Why go through such a complicated process to create itself, is this really the most efficient way? What does this thing ultimately want? If we were to find life on other planets, would it disprove everything I said so far?

Anyways let me know what you think. I‚Äôm always open to changing my mind, but as far as I can tell this is the zoomed out version of what the fuck is happening in this crazy world we find ourselves in.",0.0,Neutral,English

2020-12-18,"Has there always been such a feeling of ""being on the cusp"" or is this new?","Has there always been such a feeling of ""being on the cusp"" or is this new? I'm 22 years old, so my time on this earth is fairly limited, and the time in which I've actually known anything relevant about technological progress has been significantly less.

I keep reading about all the recent advancements in solar panel technology as well as battery cost decreases and new advancements in battery technology. It really feels like the car industry is literally within 2 to 3 years of a complete sea change in which electric cars will make gas cars more or less obsolete, not unlike mobile phones in the late 00s and early 10s.

Additionally, all the advancements in space-faring technology, especially in the private sector space, has been nothing short of astonishing. 

IBM recently released a roadmap about how they plan on getting to a 1,000 qubit quantum computer by 2023, and how this will lead the way to future systems of over 1 million qubits, with many competitors not far behind, or coming ahead.

My question is, to those with more relevant life experience than me, has there always been this much hype around nascent technologies and upcoming technological advancements or are we really at the start of a ""parabolic curve"" like Singularity proponents suggest?

It feels like things are accelerating and getting more exciting each year than every before, but I can't tell if I'm just paying more attention now that I'm older, or if things are actually different now.",0.0,Neutral,English

2020-12-06,Top Futurology News - For the month of November 2020,"Top Futurology News - For the month of November 2020 Another incredible month of progress across the spectrum: from reversing two major processes involved in aging to optics to neural brain implants to atomristors, November is definitely a month to remember.

Here are the top stories from the past month (in mostly chronological order), let's dive in:

## 1. [New Display Packs 10,000 PPI and Could Paint Stunning VR Worlds](https://singularityhub.com/2020/11/01/this-ultrahigh-resolution-display-could-paint-stunning-vr-worlds/)

*Singularity Hub*

You can plausibly say today‚Äôs virtual reality is a descendent of smartphones. The affordable sensors, chips, and high-resolution displays critical to rendering a decent VR experience were engineered for iPhones and Galaxys not Rifts and Vives. Early on, VR pioneer Oculus built prototypes with 1080p AMOLED displays from Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphones.

## 2.  [Oregon‚Äôs Decriminalization Vote Might Be Biggest Step Yet to Ending War on Drugs](https://theintercept.com/2020/11/04/oregon-drugs-decriminalization/)

*The Intercept*

Thanks to voters, Oregon will be the first state in the country to decriminalize the personal possession of all drugs, including heroin and cocaine. Oregonians passed Ballot Measure 110, also known as the Drug Decriminalization and Addiction Treatment Initiative, with 59 percent of the vote; it‚Äôs the most far-reaching of numerous successful drug-related measures on ballots nationwide, including the legalization of recreational marijuana in New Jersey, Arizona, Montana, and South Dakota. 


## 3. [MIT Creates Battery-Free Underwater GPS](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/316887-mit-creates-battery-free-underwater-gps)

*ExtremeTech*

If you need to know where you are, there‚Äôs a network of GPS satellites in orbit that can tell you with a high degree of accuracy. That is, unless, you‚Äôre underwater. The GPS radio signal dissipates quickly when it hits water, causing a headache for scientific research at sea. The only alternative is to use acoustic systems that chew through batteries. A team from MIT has devised a battery-free tracking technology called Underwater Backscatter Localization (UBL) that could end this annoyance. 

## 4.  [Becoming a Kardashev-1 Post-Scarcity Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcIXiRftjs4)

*Singularity Hub*

The history of computer chips is a thrilling tale of extreme miniaturization. The smaller, the better is a trend that‚Äôs given birth to the digital world as we know it. So, why on earth would you want to reverse course and make chips a lot bigger? Well, while there‚Äôs no particularly good reason to have a chip the size of an iPad in an iPad, such a chip may prove to be genius for more specific uses, like artificial intelligence or simulations of the physical world.

## 10. [Tiny, high-capacity ""atomristor"" stores data in single-atom switches](https://newatlas.com/computers/memristor-single-atom-switch/)

*New Atlas*

Engineers at the University of Texas have created one of the smallest memory storage devices ever, made out of a two-dimensional material measuring one nanometer square. Dubbed an ‚Äúatomristor,‚Äù the device works on the movements of single atoms, which could pave the way for much smaller memory systems with incredible information density. The new device belongs to an emerging class of electronics called memristors, which store data using resistive switching.",0.0,Neutral,English
2020-11-29,Predictions for the next years,"Predictions for the next years -I know this post will be controversial and i hope that you guys will understand i am not a trend watcher or some futurologist, hereby i will make the compromise of not doing to crazy predictions.

2025:
25.1-Electric cars may have become the obvious choise for a new car, faster charging times denser batteries and longer ranges. The purchase price will also be lower.

25.2-Ar glasses will begin to emerge as an addition to phones, you may see a route planner or the time/weather projected to your eyes.

25.3-Smart home applications are already popular now, but whit new iot technologies and ai the platform can be expanded upon and talk to eachother, leading to a more personal iot experience. For example: Your house may now know you wake up faster by opening the qurtains than an alarm bell.

2030:
30.1-Batteries will reach the 500 wh/kg mark becoming twcee as dense. And hydrogen production will increase.

30.2-Automation will begin to replace tasks in jobs and entire jobs, this will force poeple to re-educate and take more productive jobs like from administrator to accountant. This will cause production to go up by alot and working hourse decrease alot. A standard work week might be 32 hours instead of 40 allowing 4-day work weeks.

30.3-Smart cities whit 5g/6g technologies will allow more automation like drone and robot delivery.

2035:

35.1-3d printers might become more common in households and companies.

35.2-Virtual reality will become visually emersive and mainstream but not photo-realistic, some haptic suits and omni treadmills might be widely available but relativly niche and expensive.

35.3-We might start seeing self driving cars, garbage collector vechiles and semi trucks on the road, even further improvement to battery technologies may make them all electric and some countries will have outright banned ICE sales.

35.4-Digital twins may allow the cloning and copieng of poeple and reconstructing them virtually after death.

That where some predictions! Hope you like them.

2020-11-19,Our technology & Society is stagnating -my thoughts,"Our technology & Society is stagnating -my thoughts Good evening, everyone!

I have been thinking about this for a long time and now I decided to share my thoughts with you. Please correct or criticize me if you think I'm wrong or you got something to add. Maybe my thoughts are wrong and I was just thinking wrong. Nonetheless, let's start.

In case there are some typos, excuse me please.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think that most of our technology is stagnating.

When was the last time we had a life-changing invention? The internet back in 1990 or maybe smartphones in 2000? Those two, were definitly major inventions who had a giant impact on our life. But if we look around us now, where is the next ""Big thing""?

While it is true that we have made insane progress and development in medicine, CRISP-R for example, the new products we see today are somehow just improved versions of inventions which were invented in the past.

Let's remember the times when we were kids. How did we imagine the year 2020 back then?

Flying cars, intelligent robots in our daily life and maybe also huge futuristic buildings?

Now look around, not much of this has changed to the future we imagined.  I think what we lack is futuristic thinking. We need futurisic thinking and a futuristic mindset to elevate humanity onto the next step of progress and development.

We need to rethink our understanding of design, architecture and our affinity to new technologies.

With said mindset, we could have already achieved the futuristic world we dreamed of, now in 2020 while we are here reading this text.

You might ask yourself, ""Why does he think that we need to rethink our understanding of design and architecture?"", let me tell you my thoughts.

Let's take this for example: Where do most of us study/concentrate better? At home or a library? Most people would probably answer this question with ""in the library"".

Here's another example: ""Where do most of us work better/more efficiently?"" At home or at a nice office? Also most people would probably answer this question with ""at a nice office"".

These locations have a special ""atmosphere/ambience"" that subconciously changes our mindset to a better suited one for the different tasks. Working/studying, etc.

So here's my suggestion: We have to create a futuristic environment which will encourage our futuristic thinking. If people or inventors are in a futuristic environment, they will create much more, better and influential inventions/products than in boring environment like ours (right now).

As a great example we could take citites like dubai, Singapore or Hongkong, there are some more great examples but these are the ones that came up in my mind first.

Those citities already have a futuristic environment, mostly only in certain districts, but this can already change a lot. So by creating a futuristic environment I mean building new futuristic buildings, changing the design of daily products to more futuristic ones, more lighting, etc.

&#x200B;

The last point I want to discuss with you is how we might be able to achieve that as we can't just easily build a futuristic tower/building as a simple individual of the working class.

What about focussing more on upcoming inventors, university students in a tech major, robotics students, informatics with AI, etc. There's too much to mention them all, but I think you get the point, intead of investing millions and billions into quite unnecessary things such as generic pop musicians and other pointless industries where we waste such a large amount of money. How do they help to develop our technology? Do they invest into inventors or smart minds? Most don't.

Also what I noticed, is that the major technology corporations aren't much innovative anymore.

Every year we get a new Iphone (for example), 9,10,11 and so on. But in the end it's just an iphone after all. Besides the specs, not much has changed.

It's always thrilling when big car companies like BMW for example present their newest concept car. The ""Vision Next 100"" has really amazed me. But in the end they just produce one such futuristic prototype which propably will never be available to the masses.

There's a lot of amazing technology already out there, but most just stay prototypes or are extremely expensive, so most normal people can't afford them.

&#x200B;

If we want to change the world into a more technologized and futuristic world, the majority of society has to be able to use and buy such tech. As soon as those technologies or inventions are being mass-produced, their price drops by a lot, making them affordable for us. But this can only happen, when the inventors and developers get enough help and encouragement from society.

&#x200B;

My dream and vision, is to live in a highly technolized futuristic world like I imagined it as a kid (and as I also do now), before I die as an old man. It would be a shame if I didn't get to experience such beauty in architecture, design and technology before I die.

Thanks for taking your time and reading my thoughts. Feel free to start a discussion or correct me if I mentioned wrong stuff.

&#x200B;

Together we shall change the world!

2020-08-25,Idea on How to Avoid the Negative Social Impacts of Automation,"Idea on How to Avoid the Negative Social Impacts of Automation The Problem: As we transition from manual labor to automation, thousands of people are going to find themselves out of work. It would be unfair and economically damaging to let them slide into poverty because someone in Silicon Valley found a way to give their job to a robot. I have an idea about how to avoid this, but I'm sure there are problems with my solution that I haven't thought of. Alternatively, you might have a better solution to this problem, and I would be very interested in what you come up with!

You get two options if you lose your job due to automation.

1. Receive something similar to a government-funded UBI that pays around minimum wage for the rest of their life.
2. Receive a government-funded education that prepares them to join a more highly-skilled workforce. They have the option to learn a new skill for free, and then become a productive member of the new advanced society, where they can make significantly more money.

Perks of these options:

* Smooth way to transition from human-powered mundane tasks (basic assembly, meat processing, harvesting, etc.).
* The future is automated, and we need a way to transition into it.
   * Can either let people slide into homelessness and poverty when this transition happens, or treat them like human beings and give them a chance to either live out their life in moderate comfort (UBI), or progress as an individual and help society advance (education).
* Avoids homelessness, mass-poverty, increased crime, and the endless negative impacts of having millions of jobless individuals in society.

Cons:

* Nearsighted critics will argue that both options are too costly (counterpoint...poverty -> desperation -> crime -> prison -> same or higher cost with lower satisfaction on all sides and someone got robbed)
* Creates a burden for tax-paying workers that just feels bad. 
* Asking the government to implement this seems laughable. The end-product will have a million hoops to jump through, inevitable bureaucracy, and efficacy of the program will likely fluctuate with political cycles.",-0.6451534628868103,Negative,English

2020-08-10,Laser Phosphor Display; The Next-Gen CRT,"Laser Phosphor Display; The Next-Gen CRT **Advantages:**

LPDs would make the perfect CRT replacement, as they are thinner than a CRT, draw 70-75% less power than LCDs, have amazing contrast with no apparent LCD backlight, sport 180 degree viewing angles, *(better than CRT's 178)* doesn‚Äôt require a vacuum or any high voltages as it works on laser induced phosphorescence vs electron induced phosphorescence, *(eliminating radiation from no x-ray effect that CRTs get in a vacuum)* doesn‚Äôt require large electromagnets for deflection as it can use small 2d MEMS mirrors, and doesn't suffer from motion blur that even the best liquid crystal screens can get. You also don't have the drawback of absent multi-scan like with SED/FED development, since LPD technology is very so capable of this feature. LPD screens also have very high refresh rates up to 360hz, and can manipulate its imaging currently embedded in video-walls & projectors to appear bigger or smaller. *(take that you photo shoppers!)*

As for the moving optics; These are micro mirrors on a DLP chip, around the same size as one in your PC. These won't be too loud, bulky, or overheat. *(Although, one concern I have are the reliability of the mirrors, as if someone knocked or moved them, or the compressor/air supply to the air bearing ever failed.)*

**Disadvantages**:

One disadvantage of LPD is that the displays are deeper than some competing technologies. Because of this offset, Prysm has been developing LPD for video walls and projectors in 100+ inch units. Many question how long it will take Prysm to start developing consumer friendly models. *(72 inch TV's would be a good start for them in scaling down from large corporate advertising markets)*

LPD only covers 89% of the Rec. 709 color space. CRT displays had a limited color space due to their phosphors and it looks like LPD shares that weakness. *(lower resolutions would still look very good)*

CRTs were awfully dim and had terrible ANSI contrast. This wasn't addressed with current TD2 LPD technology, so hopefully these are some aspects that could get looked at and improved upon.

**Some Potential Concerns Regarding LPD Tech in its current state with Video-walls/Projectors:**

LPD can do 14-bit RGB video processing, but this doesn't tell us what the display can show. Since this isn't mentioned on their website, I would be safe & assume that the display can only output 8-bit RGB.

Like with SED & FED prototypes, many wonder how thin the panels could get with LPD technology. Many of this speculation is albeit how unsure analysts think Prysm could get their reflective mirrors to fit inside of a smaller device, per say a phone. In theory, as the screen size increases, the laser/mirror array has to be further away from the phosphor screen, increasing the depth of the display. *(this could prevent portable handheld devices like tablets, laptops, & phones from hitting the market due to dimensions)*

The DLP chip itself poses a problem with the color wheel they use. For some people, they cause a ""rainbow effect"" where brief flashes of color will be present across the screen, especially when you move your head or look at the edges of the screen from the corner of your eyes. *(This is however solved when using 3-chip systems or separate laser beams. But this will surely cost more to future proof in design)*

**The Future:**

There has been research since Mitsubishi launched their laser displays using DLP micro mirror devices in 2009 where light could be ""bent"" by passing current through ""special"" optics, there by losing the need for moving optics. It was in correlation to new optical drives. They made the claim of being able to read entire blue-rays in under a second. Imagine this type of development in LPD technology!",0.7001189589500427,Positive,English

On an international non profit level, such that politics are aside...

I am an American with a Chemical Engineering degree with a passion for computers and the environment. 

A few years ago there was a lot of rage about quantum computers and qbits and multiple states allowing for an n+1 degree of permutations in some kind of hypothetical simulation scenarios. I feel like everything is too romantic when it comes to quantum computers simulating drug possibilities. However, this is based on my very basic knowledge of algorithms limited to a single discrete math course in University


Is this something that big pharma is already doing, has been doing?


In a conversation with a med school graduate, she told me that there were many ""null"" areas, symptoms and topics that were described as still unexplained.  

So why has there not been a sorting algorithm that just continuously cross checks symptoms, patient history, location, municipality information, purchasing patterns, hiring patterns, mobile phone data, litterrally everything and anything that is logged so that statistically meaningful causes churn up on the other side?

I can imagine the argument regarding computing power but of course that is really open ended. Surely there is billions and maybe trillions of dollars moving around in the medical industry. So I can't see how this isn't literally required in a humanitarian point of view. So, who is to blame? Definitely not politicians, because it would effect their parties political interests to pioneer for a futuristic cause.

TLDR: how come there is not empirical analysis of big data being worked on and funded in a non profit sense.

TLDR2: companies can target ads why can't they target Mary and John both bought red apples at Kroger Mary and John both got a plasma TV at best buy Mary is in Delaware john is in Seatle. Mary and John would not respond to this medicine...

As Trump would say ""That is a nasty question""

2020-07-30,Speaking may become unfashionable in the future.,"Speaking may become unfashionable in the future. Sounds crazy but let me explain why I say that.  Two reasons.  We have all learned recently that spit really flies when people talk.  To the point where it has been identified as a core disease transmission vector and people are wearing masks and face shields.

The second part of it is high-bandwidth brain-computer interfaces, such as Neuralink.  Assuming these reach some of their potential, anyone with a good implant will basically be a telepath, meaning they can communicate directly with their brains.  And these BCIs will allow for high-bandwidth integration with advanced AI that should give significant cognitive advantages to those that posses them.

So I think that in certain segments of society, high bandwidth BCIs will be very desirable and create a subculture of people who use them.  They could become as ubiquitous as cell phones.

It is also quite likely that these digital telepathic communications services will provide advantages over plain speech.  For example, the ability to instantaneously attach images to messages without barely any conscious effort.  Or perhaps shared hallucinations in the form of a common augmented reality that only those with implants can see.

In this context, speech may be seen as a dirty and primitive form of communication.  And so it could become unpopular and its use may be seen as demonstrating a lack of sophistication.  Or for some possibly smaller opposing subculture which rejects implants, use of speech might signal a friendly.",0.0,Neutral,English

2020-09-09,Option assignment procedure,"Option assignment procedure  I am new to trading options in USA (have traded them in another country). I would like to understand how option excercise/assignment happens and what are the timelines. I tried to find this info clearly online but could not find all the details. Even TD ameritrade customer support was not very clear on lot of things.

I was holding TSLA iron condor that expired on 4th Feb. Sold (Iron condor -420/435 Call credit spread and 405/395 Put Credit spread) I took the risk of letting them expire based on the assumption that everything will be out of the money.

The price of TSLA at 4 pm was around 418 while around 4:50 pm new came that Tesla was not included in S&P 500 so it tanked to 392 which put my 405/395 PUT credit spread in risk (under my assumption that option closing price is 4 pm but option settlement time is different - which I dont know -- can someone clarify))

1. I would like to understand the timelines. What is the final settlement time for stock options and how is the final settlement price calculated? Is this settlement mechanism same for SPY too? I plan to only trade SPY and other liquid stock options (AAPL,TSLA,MSFT etc)
2. If both my PUTs are in the money(405/395) then does the assignment/excercise is automatic for in the money options.(probably can vary from broker to broker - mine is TD Ameritrade)
3. If answer to 2) is Yes and both puts end in the money then do I still need to have (405\*100=$40500) in my account for this account automatic procedure to happen or will my broker be smart enough to automatically use my 395 long PUT to sell tge assigned shares and directly debit my account by $1000 ((405-395)\*100)
4. Imagine if I was holding 430 PUT this friday and I got that assigned then what time will the broker inform me about this assignment? Also when will the shares show up in my account. Will it be Monday (T+1 day - assuming it to be working day). I might be under margin call with debit balance since I got assigned. Will I be able to sell to close these 100 assigned shares?

08:45 Anonymous so far: Hello  
08:45 **Sean\_B**: Corporate actions do not flow through to paper money unforutnatley. This throws off your acocunt balances and profit and loss numbers. Did you want me to remove it for you at your brakeven price?  
08:46 Anonymous so far: My son says that we can adjust the amount of shares to what it should be.  Should we do that?    
08:46 Anonymous so far: We have made a good deal on both stocks and I don't want to lose that progress.  This is all a training excercise for him (he's 16).  
08:47 Anonymous so far: He says we can right click on the stock and choose adjust position.  Would that work for us?  
08:51 **Sean\_B**: The easiest way would be to remove them all at breakeven, then adjust gain and add them at the priceyou' d ;like  
08:51 **Sean\_B**: adjust again\*

08:54 **Sean\_B**: Sorry, AAPL is 4  
08:54 **Sean\_B**: TSLA is 5  
08:55 Anonymous so far: We bought 100 AAPL at 383.57.  We should have 400 total at no extra cost.

08:57 **Sean\_B**: You get 4x the shares, and your cost basisis divided by 4

08:58 Anonymous so far: We should simply havve 400 stocks at the current price.  
08:58 Anonymous so far: And 100 in TSLA  
08:59 Anonymous so far: If we gave ourselves 300 AAPL for 0.00 it should be fully accurate, I think.

09:01 **Sean\_B**: That would not be accurate  
09:01 Anonymous so far: Why?  
09:02 **Sean\_B**: The easiest way is to remove all shares and then add it back with the new shares and cost basis  
09:02 Anonymous so far: If ours split our 100 shares would have changes to 400 automatically  
09:02 **Sean\_B**: Because a cpost basis of $0 would give you $125 profit per share  
09:02 Anonymous so far: No, the price of the stock quartered with the split.  
09:03 Anonymous so far: There is no gain or loss with a split.  You get 4 times the stocks and the price is cut by 1/4.  
09:03 Anonymous so far: But if you don't get the split and the price is quartered, that's a massive incorrect loss.  
09:04 **Sean\_B**: Im aware of how a split works. The easiest way is to remove all shares and then add the new shares with yoru new prices  
09:04 **Sean\_B**: So if you had a 10 sahres with a cost basis of 100, you can add 40 with a cost basis of $25  
09:05 **Sean\_B**: If you want to clacualte it out and do it some other way, that fine, That is just the way I recommend

09:05 **Sean\_B**: .I have other chats to get to. Are there any other questions I can answer?

I was wondering if people recommend ATP for day trading? I looked at some videos on YouTube and looks pretty good. Now, I have Apple M1 laptop so looks like ATP won't be supported for a while. I just downloaded it and looked too clunky. I do have an another Mac that's running on Catalina.

My long term investments are all on there and I hear that Fidelity actually fills the orders the best out of any brokers out there. I think this may be true because I remember trying to fill in an order for a quick day trade and Fidelity filled it at a lower price while Webull's didn't fill at all. But it was hell having to refresh just to see the current stock price. 

I like doing swings mostly. I know the Fidelity app itself is also bit clunky already and they don't have a live ask/bid chart like WeBull does on their phone. I wish they can add that.

Thank you if you got this far!",0.0,Neutral,English
2020-12-18,Unacceptable Experiences with Fidelity on opening new account (details),"Unacceptable Experiences with Fidelity on opening new account (details) Details on my unacceptable experiences on a new account setup, funding, poor rep training, disclosures, etc.  with Fidelity :

Pre-research - decent reviews and read their online marketing materials about have both Cash Mgt Account and Trading account and the ability to move between accounts.  The only time-frame I came across was an EFT funding time of 1 to 3 days which even that seemed somewhat long.  No mention of additional significant delays on their main pages.

Day 1 - called and as I created the account using a browser I explained my intent so no mistakes would happen.  The front-line rep answered in less than 5 minutes (good).  I explained I wanted to short a stock as soon as possible.  We discussed the brokerage account and their cash management account and the rep said getting both is common.  so the application would be completed asap.  (**Company Issue #1)

We discussed the margin requirement of $5000 and to apply for the margin account on day 2 so it would be approved asap.  We discussed funding the account and she explained an EFT to EITHER account would allow me to short stocks asap.  When I explained only the trading account would allow me to short stocks after margin approval, she said it didn't matter which account I funded as EFT transfers are available in 2 to 3 business days (wrong in this situation) (**Company Issues #2).  I decided to eft into the cash account since it was coming from my bank it seemed logical with no delay on my intent to short stocks based on the rep's instructions.  Note - the Cash Mgt account does allow you to basic trade within 3 business days, but not short stocks or other services the trading account with margin approval requires, which totally messed up my plans as discussed with their support.

Day 2 - called and reported as over 30 minute wait time.  I wanted to discuss the process of transferring when the funds became available for transfer and shorting.  I requested a callback using their system which never happened.  (**Company Issue #3)

Day 5 after weekend - $5000 deposit showed as available for trading in cash mgt account, but not available to move to trading account as promised by Rep 1.  Called to complain and told that by Day 6 (Bus day 3) the funds would be available to move to trading account or withdrawal (wrong again) (**Company Issue #4).  I explained I wanted to verify the margin account had been approved and was told I would have to speak with a margin specialist.  I also complained about the confusion of the situation.  A 35 minute transfer time ((Company Issue #4) and reached the margin.trading specialist.  He researched and confirmed margin account was approved (good), but bad news is the Fidelity has a ""Collection Period"" on EFT that add an average of 4 additional business days.  Worse News, it actually is now running 6 days so would not be available to transfer until Day 9 which was 8th day after opening account.  I reported: lack of documentation on website (**Company Issue #5), 4 days turning into 6 days (Company Issue #6),3 reps telling me absolutely wrong information (**Company Issue #7) ( and asked for explanation and escalation.  I was told it would be reported.  I explained I was documenting all these issues and would check on the morning 8th day after opening account.  No other escalation was offered (**Company Issue #8)

Day 5 to Day 9 - The stock I wanted to short went down 21%.  Still cannot short due to Fidelity missteps.  Of course Fidelity will take no responsibility for this situation or my unrealized gains.

Day 9 - Funds still not available  (**Company Issue #9)  Called and reach a basic rep in under 5 minutes (good).  Rep now confirmed funds won't be available until 1 more day (Saturday) with no other explanation.  I again requested escalation as this was unacceptable.  I was told due to low call volume the transfer should be less than my last transfer of 30 minutes.  After complaining several more times about long transfer times, over 60 minutes later a transfer was achieved (**repeat #4).  I immediately escalated to manager who merely confirmed the current funding date would be one more day.  I requested escalation or resolution on the call, but none were offered (**Company Issue #10).  I requested escalation to the office of the president or a save account team, none were available (**Company Issue #11).  I explained I would be filing complaints in several ways.  Calls to Fidelity Management were not clearly possible, I even attempted to reach the President Abigail Johnson, who was not available in the phone system.

Summary: Fidelity has so many issues with training, missing disclosure, industry excessive funding delays (not disclosed company-wide or on marketing pages), wait times, lack of escalation, I am working on moving to a different brokerage immediately and sharing my unacceptable experiences to warn others.  No other brokerage I have researched takes with long for EFT full availability and also fails to disclose a 9 day process at account setup.",0.0,Neutral,English

2020-08-10,Portfolio Optimisation with MlFinLab: Estimation of Risk,"Portfolio Optimisation with MlFinLab: Estimation of Risk Risk has always played a very large role in the world of finance with the performance of a large number of investment and trading strategies being dependent on the efficient estimation of underlying market risk. With regards to this, one of the most popular and commonly used representation of risk in finance is through a covariance matrix ‚Äì higher covariance values mean more volatility in the markets and vice-versa. This also comes with a caveat ‚Äì empirical covariance values are always measured using historical data and are extremely sensitive to small changes in market conditions. This makes the covariance matrix an unreliable estimator of the true risk and calls for a need to have better estimators.

Part-4 of ""Portfolio Optimisation with MlFinLab"" series goes through some commonly used methods of calculating the covariance matrices starting from simple methods like Maximum Likelihood, Minimum Covariance Determinant to more advanced ones like Shrinkage, Denoising and Detoning.

2020-08-04,Portfolio Optimisation with MlFinLab: Theory-Implied Correlation Matrix,"Portfolio Optimisation with MlFinLab: Theory-Implied Correlation Matrix Traditionally, correlation matrices have always played a large role in finance. They have been used in tasks ranging from portfolio management to risk management and are calculated based on historical empirical observations. Although they are used so frequently, these correlation matrices often have poor predictive power and prove to be unreliable estimators.

In 2019, Marcos Lopez de Prado published a paper on Theory-Implied Correlation (TIC) matrix which combines external market views with empirical observations to generate better and less noisy estimates of the asset correlations. The additional market views are expressed in the form of a hierarchical tree structure which breaks down assets into clusters based on sectors, market cap, size etc... Due to this, the new correlations generated tend to be in sync with economic theory.

The TIC algorithm is now available as a Python implementation in MlFinLab to be used on financial data - [https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/portfolio\_optimisation/theory\_implied\_correlation.html](https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/portfolio_optimisation/theory_implied_correlation.html)

2020-07-06,Beyond Risk Parity: The Hierarchical Equal Risk Contribution Algorithm,"Beyond Risk Parity: The Hierarchical Equal Risk Contribution Algorithm Ever since the seminal paper on Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP), there has been a lot of new research on using hierarchical clustering for portfolio allocation. I recently came across the Hierarchical Equal Risk Contribution (HERC) algorithm developed by [**Thomas Raffinot**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAIQ2IkBeO9tfg0OUlcAJCdc5hxcr3yT98g). By building upon the notion of hierarchy introduced by HRP and using the same machine learning approach, HERC aims at diversifying capital and risk allocation. Selection of appropriate number of clusters and the addition of different risk measures like CVaR and CDaR help in generating better risk-adjusted portfolios with good out-of-sample performance. In my opinion this algorithm is an important addition to the growing list of hierarchical clustering based portfolio optimisation methods.

I have written a detailed blog post on the motivations behind the method and a mathematical explanation of the steps involved in its working - [https://hudsonthames.org/beyond-risk-parity-the-hierarchical-equal-risk-contribution-algorithm/](https://hudsonthames.org/beyond-risk-parity-the-hierarchical-equal-risk-contribution-algorithm/)

2020-01-15,Renaissance Technologies,"Renaissance Technologies Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.

Founded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average gross return of 66.1% since 1988.

With an average net return of 39.1% after fees.

The Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.

Since, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.

Now, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).

Medallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.

Notice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.

In 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%

**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.

That certainly beats inflation...

So, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?

&#x200B;

**PART 1: The Early Stages**

Early on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.

Remember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,‚Äù Simons said. ‚ÄúA pure system without humans interfering.‚Äù

Simons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information

Straus‚Äô was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.

He became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.

Over time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.

In fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!

At the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.

The return in 2008 is a prime example of that.

Commodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.

The fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.

&#x200B;

**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**

Now in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the ""best math department in the world"".

Therefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.

We are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.

RenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.

The strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).

Simons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.

In 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&P 500 at an unusually low level.

This test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.

It had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.

Magerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.

Finally, the simulator‚Äôs algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.

The resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman‚Äôs calculations.

Only then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....

&#x200B;

**PART 3: Infrastructure**

Now I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.

Big data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.

The problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:

Building a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.

To then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.

RenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.

They have completely automated the process of signal discovery:

They don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.

RenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.

The data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.

The mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.

You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.
