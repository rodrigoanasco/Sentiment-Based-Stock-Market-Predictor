Wait... 30,000, how did that number happen?  My top limit buy was set to 11.18942 for 10,000, that triggered, makes sense.  My second two limit buys were for 10,000 and 30,000 at 11.16277 and 11.13611 respectively.  They did not trigger, makes sense since the low ask price happened at 6:12am CST and was 11.16725.

Tradingview has become a bit too expensive for my taste, especially since I don't chart at all - I just glance at the chart; paying 15 USD/month for 20 alerts seems a bit like a rip-off

I need something to send push alerts to my phone in real time. I am currently using cTrader but there is something weird with its alerts, where they only ping when I pick it up - like it's not really push notifications, but it refreshes only when I unlock my phone.

It has to be server side, as I mostly wanna trade off my phone. Ive considered mt4 on a VPS but I doubt that is the best option really...

Has to be easy to put alerts. Preferably off a chart, not manually entering numbers (i use >30 alerts per day)

It has to be forex oriented. I see a lot of efforts done around stocks but I only trade FX majors

Another idea is to go for lazy, less hands-on, less trades, less mental strain, less of everything while preserving gains.

Here are the benefits as I see them:

### Lazy

* This makes trading easier to do over longer periods of time. 
* A better word for this might be simple. A lazy approach should always be pretty simple. 
* Also, this means that if there is no obvious trade you walk away and you hunt for nothing.

### Less hands-on

* As humans, we are susceptible to a lot of our own whims and moods. I think this is pretty self-explanatory.
* The idea here is to limit how much of our own whims can be imposed on a decision. 

### Less Trades

* Less trading means making few choices which means making fewer bad choices in a lot of cases. 
* Also, the mental anguish of being forced to do too much in order to stick with a system can be a detractor all by itself. 

### Less Mental strain

* As above, fewer trades help with this quite a bit.
* Also when you limit the number of choices you are allowed to make (less indicators, less time frames, etc.) you do improve your ability to notice things about those choices. 
* Automation, when possible automate most of your processes if you can. Reduce the strain and increase the gain.   


For me, the way I achieve this is through taking very specific trades and I do not mind a negative risk-reward profile. 

Obviously, this is not a full trading plan but it is a way to approach building a trading plan that is less rigid and is more easily followed.

The first step that allowed me to implement this trading methodology was to start trading with an uneven risk reward (Negative) most people demand a 1:2 risk reward. Whereas I am ok with a 5:1 as long as my win rate is crazy high.

The way I implement this is by doing some extensive backtesting. The work here allows me to be lazy in the future.  (Automated, lazy work).

Then Optimize where you can without overdoing it. The goal was a single pair strategy that would give me a few trades a week. 

Here is what I ended up with and this is the system I trade live

This system alerts my phone and I enter the trade manually. 

Just to play devil's advocate, I have run the trading backtests using more dynamic stop losses and taking more trades and the % profit does increase quite a bit. 

It looks great but requires a lot more interaction. I am busy and it is just not worth it to me to spend the extra time executing trades.

2022-08-07,what's been your hardware setup over the years,"what's been your hardware setup over the years Ive been doing a bunch of research, testing and getting ready for a new laptop for trading because my current one is a total lemon.  Thought i'd do a little brain dump for what has has or hasn't worked for me.

1. Dont go off buying a bunch of monitors before you know what you're doing.  I know its cool and enticing and its always fun to buy new gear, but its likely unnecessary.  This is what i did when i first started (dual flanking 4k monitors), but without really knowing to to look for, it just ended up being too much info.  Even a single 4k 27"" monitor is too big, too much.  Something about just having it all on a laptop screen, where my eyes dont have to jump around everywhere, helps me focus.  I might use secondary monitor now in vertical orientation for rolling charts or chat apps, but its unnecessary.  I try to keep my desk as clear and simple as possible.
2. If you like just look at one chart at a time, thats really nice, almost any setup will work for you.  Personally I do multiple tf analysis so i like to have multiple charts open at once (no indicators), so i need something a bit bigger and higher rez.
3. My current laptop is a 15.6"" 4k.  4k is too high to view a chart comfortably pixel perfect (the wicks are tiny, causes eye strain).  Having it at 200% (essentially 1080p for the chart) is decent.  Text is super sharp but the chart bars are just a tad too big.
4. Right now i'm eyeing either the LG Gram 16/17, Lenovo slim 7 pro 16, and Lenovo Thinkbook Plus gen 3 as a darkhorse new release.  Testing QHD resolution at the stores at those sizes, it feels just about right.  The thinkbook plus is verrrry interesting but it might be a tad bit unwieldy, matte screen, and battery isn't so good.  Macbook was considered but the resolution is a bit too high and dont want to deal with running into odd software compatibility issues (and they're expensive af).
5. Glossy vs matte display.  I didn't expect this to be a thing but as i was comparing laptops, i never realized how blurry and dull matte displays can be.  They're probably fine for one chart setups, but when you're running your charts at pixel perfect resolutions, there's a slight haze/blur.  Things are razor sharp with glossy panels, with nice color pop.  But if you like to do your charting outdoors or in brighter/busy areas, matte makes it much easier.  Ive gotten use to tuning out the reflections of glossy.  The exception are macbooks, their displays a nice inbetween of both worlds.  Not sure why no one else use their anti-glare coating.
6. I dont use my phone for trading at all.  1, because of multi tf analysis. 2, i dont usually buy market, my zones are precise limit orders.  3, I try to keep my trading and my irl separate.  No trading apps on my phone.  I've tried it and realized im often glued to my phone when im out and about.  I do notice young people really love to trade off their phones though, which is great if it works for you.

Also I currently have no idea what's the balance on the account, for all i know it could be negative (i don't have any experience with forex related stuff, and the reports in the mails look complicated)

I do know that it's O.L.O Platforms FZE because he was logged in to his gmail account on phone, so i can see the reports, confirmations and so on. I want to make sure this account isn't linked to his bank account and want to make sure at least there is no possiblity to enter debt. If possible also to stop all currently open trades and retrieve the balance.

I'm asking this before I contacted them (there are a lot of calls from Cyprus on his phone) because I have a feeling (especially regarding retrieving any money that he had on the account) that it's not going to be easy. I guess I will have to prove to them I'm a relative and that he passed away?  


I guess many people have been in similar situation but I'm not sure where to look for advice on that, or that this is a correct subreddit to post to. Any pointers would be appreciated.

2022-07-08,My strategy and Psycological tips for anyone,"My strategy and Psycological tips for anyone I went from almost, almost burning an account (-70%) (300 dollars account, not a big deal) to consistently recover my equity in 2 months or so looking at the market as if it moves following the next pattern.  


On HTF (Daily to 1H) i look for the bias (very important), i mark the swing with a fibonacci (just to mark the swing, i dont trade levels) and the Point of Interest with a box.

If price reached the box, i ONLY TOOK TRADES AWAY from the box, if price is moving trough the box, i take ONLY TRADES LOOKING TO REACH THE BOX

In LTF timeframes (15m, 5m, 1m) i look for

\- Consolidation  
\- Liquidity  
\+ OB on liquidity take (Entry)  
\+ If price liquidates a distribution straight to an OB, i took that ob as an entry  
\- Distribution  
\+ I almost always look for the last low  


I think that the distribution is ALWAYS around 2 o 3 times the size of the distribution, not more.

An example from a trade that i took today where i made 1RR (i risk usually 10% because my account is very small, thanks to backtesting i know something near 10 losses could be my worst losing streak so i take that risk,i dont recommend it)

Rules that works for me   
\- SL never smaller than 10 pips  
\- Enter always 1 pip earlier  
\- Only trades following the HTF Bias (Most important rule)  
\- Always close 50% on 2:1 (there are only a few exceptions)  
\- Max Daily Loss: 1.5RR => if i loss 1 trade i half the risk   
\- Max Weekly Loss: 3RR  
\- Max Daily Trades: 3 or 4  
Psychological rules that helped me a lot:  
\- If I'm stressed or going through a hard situation, i don't take any trade  
\- Don't have to trade every day (This one is really important)  
\- If i win 6RR on a month, i half the risk   
\- On Fridays i only trade London Session

2022-05-13,"Balancing FTMO challenge and job, August trading","Balancing FTMO challenge and job, August trading Hi everyone.

I've been trading for a fairly short time but I'm doing very well so far.  I have my own strategy for  trend continuation and ranges. Swing trading. I use the 4h chart to draw resistance, trend lines, determine any other areas of value and my entry trigger is on the 1h chart. I would say that I have a fairly firm handle on discipline and psychology.  I was profitable for almost 6 months on demo and I made 5% in my first month live, April. So far for May I'm up 8%.  I'm not saying this to brag, I just want to explain the context of my question.

My full time job is in a factory. I work one week day shift, followed by one week night shift and so on. I usually work 12 hour shifts 5 days a week. My time zone allows me to trade the London open on night shift weeks and the New York open on day shift weeks.  I only enter trades on my desktop computer at home, I will never place a trade on my phone, since I can't do proper analysis that way. But I have the trading view app to monitor my trades. I only really have time to get a good look at them on my lunch hour (the section where I work has bad cell reception). I don't exit trades prematurely, I never look at my open P&L, just the price action on open trades. The app is mostly for my peace of mind at work.

I want to take the FTMO challenge for a swing account in August.  I'm not worried about the 5% daily drawdown limit, I know how to avoid that. The difficult thing for me will be reaching the 10% profit target. I said August because I'll have a whole week off in August. That way I can be at my computer whenever I want. I know I can move my SL and TP to catch some big moves as they happen and reach 10% that way. Obviously I couldn't do that in a normal week. However I've heard that markets in August are really subdued.  I haven't experienced that first hand yet though.

Does the advantage of having a week at home to actively manage trades and catch every opportunity outweigh the slow August price action? Or should I try the challenge in a different month, bearing in mind that I'll be at work unable to actively manage my trades. Again, the 10% target is my concern, not the daily drawdown (that's easy enough with discipline).

2022-05-11,"I’ve become a really good trader, but chasing loses and psychology still letting me down","I’ve become a really good trader, but chasing loses and psychology still letting me down Okay so, here’s a backstory to my journey so far with trading. I’ve been trading forex on and off for the past 3 years, mainly day trading and scalping but have caught some big swings aswell through the years.

I’ve never traded the right way as far as risk management goes… Because I’m starting with 100€ and trying to build up quickly due to not having patience for such little money ( I know this is a bad habit and not sustainable ) I’ve always started from very little and flipped my account 5x 10x sometimes ect and even once flipped 100€ into 5000€ in about 3 weeks which was my personal best.

I’ve been doing this by going near full margin on my account when trading which I know is wrong, and I’ve been trading like this for a few years, but I also feel trading like this has made me extremely precise in catching entry’s and closing trades instinctively ( due to having very little room for error ) which I guess is a plus side to this as I feel this has made me extremely accurate on the market 70 - 80% of the time.

In the last year my win rate has increased massively, and the likelihood of me being able to flip my 100€ account is more common to happen than not.

Okay so there’s the back story.

————————————-

I know this way is completely gambling, and I admit I am a bit of a gambler, but I am becoming what I believe to be really good at this now from my experience of trading through the years, especially being under the full margin pressure for majority of my trading.

Chasing loses is a big thing for me and I think if I can sort my impulses out with it I can be successful long term , I remember with my 5000€ account ( my personal best I flipped from 100€) I lost 1000€ of it bringing my balance down to 4300€ or something roughly, and after that I just freaked out…

Shortly after that I hit 2.5k, probably only about 2 hours later, and then I deleted the app off my phone for a few hours, but the damage was done, I didn’t care about that 2.5k as all I could think about was the 5k, I downloaded the app again a few hours later and as you can predict … impulsive , and excessive trading lead me down to 0€ before the next night.

I know I probably should’ve took a longer break , I’ve heard people say they have rules to counteract chasing loses such as not allowing any more trading for the day after a loss or certain percentage loses for the week etc, but I’d love to know if anyone here went through this , had bad gambling tendencies , and still managed to come out on the other side successful and how did yous beat it? 

I feel now that I have a really good skill and knack for this, and it would be real a talent gone to waste if I cant get over this step.

Btw I know risk management is also a problem, but I just trade heavy at the start to build a decent account from my 100€ and once successful at that I do drop the position sizing down and don’t risk it all every trade , I just risk my 100€ at the start to flip myself up to an account worth trading with and putting in the hours with.

Id love to flip an account to a sizeable amount that I could then start playing more slowly and safely using proper risk management and be able to earn myself a nice side income every week safely, but then there’s also the fear that my old habit of chasing loses will come back, they say it takes years to build an empire and one bad day to ruin it all in this and that saying describes my trading very well, and until I kick my habit of chasing losses, I will never stay ahead for long.

# Introduction to spread charts

&#x200B;

[My custom setup for EUR\/USD\/GBP\/CAD spread charts](https://preview.redd.it/8p955tdb7vu81.png?width=1837&format=png&auto=webp&s=93bcb81edfc4d1c15fddf16241dfff88df87a473)

If you have ever used TradingView, you may have noticed the math symbols next to the search bar:

https://preview.redd.it/yzsbp4ne7vu81.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d028b322661f5bfd1efa0ea6091c73e747ebd9c

If you’re like me, you might have clicked on them a few times, not knowing what they do, and then given up and moved on to something else. However, these symbols unlock an extremely powerful feature called spread charting. In essence, spread charting is taking one asset and re-charting it with some alteration. For example, you can take a chart for USOIL and enter it as 1/USOIL to see an inverse chart:

&#x200B;

[USOIL Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/c9t0cefg7vu81.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=790577a42e1db31e8b44f1f03f62dab15632518b)

&#x200B;

Great! Now, I hear you ask… what’s the point? Well, just like you can flip one chart, you can also add, subtract, divide, and perform other math operations. At a basic level, you could create your own version of the popular FAANG index, but remove Netflix based on their recent earnings bomb. To do this, you would simply search for (FB+AAPL+AMZN+GOOG)/4. This will add all four symbols together and then find the mean by dividing by the number of symbols:

&#x200B;

[Daily Chart for  \(FB+AAPL+AMZN+GOOG\)\/4](https://preview.redd.it/pdah4knj7vu81.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=053f04eb63314ce6cf8da3c410c3614259bdf6a5)

Are you seeing where we are going with this? Spread charts are an incredible tool for trading correlated assets as you can create your own, custom, real-time index that is specific to your trading needs.

# Applying the concept to Forex

On the face of it, one of the issues with applying this concept to Forex is that there is no central “index”, and FX pairs behave very differently from stocks and commodities. While the value of Apple might increase in line with the S&P500, a currency is very different. EURUSD could be bearish, while EURJPY is bullish.  The closest analogue for an index is DXY, but what if we want to know the strength of the Aussie Dollar? One solution would be to have a DXY equivalent for every currency. We could then see how strong or weak any given currency is and use this information to inform trading decisions. Thankfully, this has already been partially created. There are various currency strength sites out there, such as MarketMilk and [currency-strength.com](https://currency-strength.com), which attempt to quantify the strength or weakness of each base currency. With some math, we can then create an index for each major currency:

&#x200B;

* EUR = (EURUSD+EURJPY+EURCHF+EURGBP+EURAUD+EURCAD+EURNZD)/7
* USD = (1/EURUSD+USDJPY+USDCHF-GBPUSD-AUDUSD+USDCAD-NZDUSD)/7
* GBP = (1/EURGBP+GBPUSD+GBPCHF+GBPJPY+GBPAUD+GBPCAD+GBPNZD)/7
* And so on...

We add all the pairs where the currency is the base, subtract where it is the quote, and divide by the number of other currencies indexed against (7). You can do the same for the other majors like CAD, JPY, AUD, CHF, and NZD. In the end, you can start charting strength charts for any currency you like. The benefit now is that you can analyse those charts for relative strength/weakness plays, but you can also apply indicators to them to more thoroughly understand any underlying trends.

&#x200B;

[Finished Setup](https://preview.redd.it/4neoh39y7vu81.png?width=1837&format=png&auto=webp&s=2152db589db47a7bf53f69346edd9586df294e96)

Since I use Ichimoku for my trading, I also apply it to these synthetic charts. Of course, you can apply any indicator you like, or none at all.

# Thoughts and Considerations

Remember when I said Forex is not at all like stocks or commodities? This is very important to remember when you interpret strength charts. In fact, I think looking at these charts will help any trader more intuitively understand how the market works. For example, if you trade stocks and the S&P500 is surging up, it is very likely that if you pick a random constituent of the S&P500, it will also be trading higher. This is not true in Forex. If the EUR is surging higher in strength, it is entirely possible that major EUR pairs such as EURUSD or EURJPY are either treading water or heading down. This is because you also need to consider the relative strength or weakness of USD and JPY in each of those examples. EUR could be heading higher, but so could USD. If USD is stronger than the EUR, it doesn’t matter how much strength EUR has; the market will likely be ranging or heading lower. Therefore, it is critical to use Forex spread charts to look for relative opportunities between each base currency. Some examples of where this method is very powerful include:

* If the base you’re tracking is heading up or down, but a specific pair is holding in a range, this is a strong sign of relative strength/weakness. It is likely that when the base trend reverses, the pair you’re watching will reverse hard. You see this all the time in stocks where the market heads higher, but a specific stock doesn’t move up (indicating selling pressure, despite the macro trend). Once the market reverses, that specific stock usually slams down faster than the market—same concept in FX.
* Identify strong trends. Using spread charts it is very easy to see if one base is heading higher, while the other is heading lower. A great example of this is USD vs JPY. If you open up a spread chart of USD it has been heading higher, versus JPY heading lower. If you see strong trends on spread charts, this flows into the pairs themselves and is a great confluence for a trend trade.

Here is the USD and JPY spread charts from Feb 2022 until now. The spread charts clearly show USD strength and JPY weakness and are a confluence of the strong trend we have been seeing in USDJPY.

That aside I noticed that really successful traders tend to act like lone wolves. Very few legitimate traders are in the marketing business(courses, signals, robots, mentorship). I have taken several trading courses over the past years (some absolute rubbish others very enlightening), and every time at the end of each course, the instructor will take down everyone’s names, phone numbers and e-mails, and will distribute the contact list to every course attendee with the hope that we would  get together in the future to trade and exchange ideas. This is especially common if you show a lot of progress and growth as a trader in the group. But... apart from a couple of e-mails right after the course and maybe follow ups on some of the more outstanding traders in the group, they tend to disappear first, followed by the rest.

Good Forex traders unfortunately do not want to share their secrets. I know some of you may disagree and that's fine. But I mean you can’t blame them. It is a net sum zero game. Only the good one survive. I've never heard of a business model that creates a large volume of competition for itself ultimately bringing its self out of business.

Let me explain.

 Say I trade the Forex market

I have a verifiable track record. I don't want to do business with others. Why would I, when I can do it for myself? I no longer need capital from others. I don't need the famous multiple streams of income (courses, signals). I no longer need commissions from others or from brokers. I can make money on my own or with my big shot private investor. I am free to do whatever I want.

For the same reason, I'd believe it is going to be super hard to find profitable traders to do business with you. Why? Because they no longer need your business nor do they have that time. They are already doing great on their own.

This is not bragging. This is life. It is what it is. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think so, think about it regardless.

The best thing I'd advise people still searching for their edge is invest in a good trading course/knowledge and coaching if possible. You cant avoid this stage. But this is a double edged sword because of the scams out there as well as a strategy possibly just not being for you. Different strategies suite different personalities and lifestyles. So ultimately I'd say build your own and be independent. You'll know when it has a problem and be skilled enough to solve that problem instead of always trying to seek out help elsewhere.  Again that will depend on which part of the world you live in. Like I said about scams, some online figures will just take your money and run or give you something recycled from another course and get you high off lifestyle euphoria.

So a good course, some coaching, practice  and backtest A LOT, followed by forward testing and be prepared to lose some money along the way, until you finally master the art. You will fail a lot, in the beginning, fail some more with experience but eventually if you're learning from your mistakes and actually are self aware and not driven by pride you will genuinely succeed. 

But it will take time, years at worst. And I'll also say don't be afraid to take breaks in your journey. Stepping away and reflecting can help you fix your mistakes, not just in trading but in life as a whole.",0.0,Neutral,English

I have an account with AxiTrader (broker) and am trading with Auvoria Prime (expert advisor). I've had this account since Dec. 2020 and it goes up, down..then up. My initial deposit was £10k. Since the Russia v. Ukraine war within the last month or so, the account balance is going down. 

But my, guess what? On Friday, the account closed as normal (with equity, £3,859.62).. but to my surprise, last night (Saturday) the account randomly went in minus equity. I'm receiving the e-nails from Axi stating to top up my account as the trades have been closed.

I'm worried and not worried as this may be a glitch. I tried to contact them via phone and live chat but their closed on the weekend.

* FS\_Latest(""OANDA:EUR\_USD"")
* FS\_Latest(""FXCM:EUR/USD"")

These 2 functions would return intra-day (1 hour) quote of EUR/USD from the beginning of today (04/01/22) until now:

* =FS\_ForexCandles( ""OANDA:EUR\_USD"" , ""60"" , ""04/01/2022"")
* =FS\_ForexCandles( ""FXCM:EUR/USD"" , ""60"" , ""04/01/2022"")

2022-12-29,Issues/Warning Regarding Tax Loss Harvesting on Fidelity Website,"Issues/Warning Regarding Tax Loss Harvesting on Fidelity Website Good morning FI community,

I advise being very careful when placing any specific lot trades with Fidelity - track the lots, screenshot/video your trades, and keep an accounting of your total shares sold somehow.

I've just gotten off the phone escalating a trade dispute with Fidelity and want to warn other folks so they don't have the same issue I am experiencing.

Fidelity's tax lot trading system is not working properly. The last 2 days I have been selling VTI and VXUS and only selecting lots that showed unrealized losses, in an attempt to 0 out my gains from earlier this year and reduce my income by $3K.

I have been investing daily-weekly for over a decade and thus hundreds of lots. I am not new to the Fidelity system and in fact worked there for some time and very well versed in their online trading system.

I started with $15K in gains I needed to negate and started selling lots sorted by greatest loss in VXUS and VTI and making corresponding occasional buys into ITOT and IXUS. I sold several pages/scrolls of the largest negative lots of both. To clarify, I was sorting the lots by amount of gains and losses. This puts the largest negative loss at the bottom of the list of lots. I would select the greatest loss first and working up for a few scrolls of the window, never getting into the unrealized positive gains, and placing the trades after 2-3 pages of lots were selected.

The preview order page showed estimated losses on every trade I placed. I finished selling these lots over the past 2 days. Today I log in today and see extremely low balances of shares in VTI and VXUS.

I call Fidelity and they review the orders and say lots were being sold for gains. The trader I spoke with told me that many orders placed had unrealized gains (not losses), and that I had a net gain through all of my trades of several thousand dollars. The trader I spoke with talked to their IT team and supervisor and have told me there is nothing they can do as the trades on their end do not reflect what I was selecting in the trade ticket for share selection.

Edit: Not a wash sale issue - I am aware of the rules. Another redditor said it seems like it may be a problem of the specific lot selection screen not updating so it allowed me to sell lots multiple times, causing it to grab different shares that weren't what I selected. This would make sense as it would sometimes update with new lots with losses larger than what I had already sold. I thought this was happening because I was told (Fidelity) I had too many lots for the screen to display them all so assumed it was normal to pull in different amounts. I wanted to harvest as much loss as possible and continued selling until the amounts shown were not high enough to warrant the time.",-0.6479673981666565,Negative,English

Late 30s, married with 2 young kids, Bay Area, ~10 years working after school in various high tech roles

I found this sub around the time I started working.  At the time, I had already been tracking my expenses for a few years through school, so I projected that I would be able to retire by age 40.  This was before I moved to Silicon Valley, got a spouse, got a house, and had 2 kids of course.

*Why not just post in the daily thread*?  I want to broadcast what I feel is a more realistic ""above average"" outcome for tech workers or other skilled professionals, who are probably over-represented here, who are finding success in the grind but will never win the company stock lottery.  I've seen too many of these threads where OP works at a FAANG or had a business take off or whatever and their NW went to the moon.  It's not realistic for 99.9% of people, and consequently **FIRE is a lot longer of a slog than you think**

[1] House remodel

[2] $300k of this is house

[3] One time windfall


**Expenses**

Current expenses are $8,400/mo, broken down as:

* Mortgage (PITI): $3,100/mo
* Childcare: $2,800/mo
* Utilities: $200/mo
* Misc. shared expenses (travel, insurance, groceries, etc.): $1,000/mo
* Black hole of personal expenses: $1,300/mo

Mortgage, utilities, and shared expenses ($4,300/mo) is just the cost of a family of 4 and I think they're fantastic for the Bay Area.  The only vacations we take are to visit family, for example.  The mortgage is for a 3 bedroom house.

Childcare will drop off within the next five years, but we're actually looking at hiring part time help for the weekends, so this number will only go up in the short term.  I have mentioned elsewhere that I literally have to do basic tasks, like mow the lawn, at night after the kids go to bed because they're so difficult

The ""black hole"" category is a bit of a cop-out, and I imagine there's stuff to cut there.  I do eat out a lot for work, to the tune of $500/mo.  Most of the rest is medical expenses (Lasik in one eye, a few $200 doctor visits became >$500 trips to urgent care thanks to Covid cautiousness by doctors)


**Thoughts**

* After 15 years, I have <10 years of expenses saved up (excluding home equity).  This is while making what I consider a high income (average ~$160k in 2022 money).  This is discouraging and honestly makes me doubt the viability of FIRE for the vast majority of families because our ""fixed"" costs are so high.  I am definitely much more pessimistic on FIRE as a movement this year
* My house was a horrible investment.  According to Redfin, my share of the house has appreciated exactly with inflation (20%, or ~150k) since I bought it.  However, I also spent >$200k renovating and expanding it.  That money is, as of today, completely gone
* Speaking of horrible investments, 2018-2022 I traded a few tech stocks (AMD -> TSLA -> NET -> RKLB).  I gained 10X on the first 3 over three years, then lost 75% on the last one in one quarter.  I'm totally out of individual stocks again and will remain so for a while",0.0,Neutral,English

## **Career Progression** - updates in  **bold**!

Year | Job | Title | Compensation | Notes

2011 | Startup A | Internship | $15/hour | Landed an internship through a professor while in college.
2012 | Startup A | Junior Engineer | $60,000 (+92.3%) | Graduated with $70,000 in student loans and stayed at the same company.
2013 | Startup A | Mid-Level Engineer | $70,000 (+16.7%) | Promotion
2014 | Startup A | Mid-Level Engineer | $80,000 (+14.3%) | Performance increase. Also, I bought a house this year.
2015 | Startup A | Engineering Manager | $85,600 (+7.0%) | Moved into a technical management role.
2017 | Startup A | Engineering Manager | $91,000 (+6.3%) | Performance increase
2017 | Startup B | Contract Engineer | $20,000 (-78.0%) | Finished paying off my student loans and needed a break from the grind. Sold all my stuff, rented out my house, and moved to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua where I contracted for a hospitality startup for 6 months in exchange for some cash, room and board, and food. 
2017 | Startup A | Director of Engineering | $110,000 (+450.0%) | Original company contacted me wanting to start an engineering office in Santiago, Chile. They offered me more money and an inflated title to move down and get it running. I got to live abroad, got more money, and got a fancy new title so I took the job. 
2018 | Startup C | Contract Engineer | $20,000 (-81.8%) | I stuck it out for a year but living in Santiago wasn't for me and the job was too stressful. I departed on a motorcycle trip from Colorado to El Salvador. I contacted a friend I had met as Startup A who had started his own digital marketing company and he contracted me for about 15 hours a week.  
2020 | Corp D | Senior Engineer | $267,000 (+1,235.0%) | After an almost two-year motorcycle trip across in Central America and Southeast Asia, I ended up stranded in Sri Lanka for four months due to Covid. Fear of economic disaster prompted me to look for a new job.
**2021** | **Corp D** | **Senior Engineer** | **$277,681 (+4.0%)** | **Performance increase**
**2022** | **Corp D** | **Senior Engineer** | **$294,341 (+6.0%)** | **Performance increase**

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/qBhMYZg.png) is a bar chart of my compensation over time.

Career Progression Takeaways:

- **The Sky is the Limit**: When I was in college, I thought if I could somehow figure out how to make $100k a year, I would be set. And it's true, that's far more money than I need to live. But, around 2017, a friend introduced me to a mobile app called Blind. Blind is a toxic social media application where privileged Silicon Valley tech bros openly and anonymously complain about their overinflated compensation packages. A lot of these guys are making a half a million dollars a year or more. I had an epiphany. The only thing holding me back was myself. I was earning what I thought I was worth and all I had to do was mentally adjust what I thought I was worth. In 2020 I was stuck in Sri Lanka for a few months. I started studying, sourcing referrals from the highest-paying companies, and telling them I wasn't considering any offers under $250k. And it worked.
- **Know What You Live For**: I don't spend a lot of money on stuff but I do spend a lot of money on experiences. Most of those losses come in the form of opportunity costs. Traveling can be pretty cheap but quitting your $300k job for a year means you are not making $300k you could have made. But, experiences and relationships are what drives me. It's hard to get over that mental hurdle but, to me, it's worth it. 
- **Filling the Gap**: In 2017 and 2018 I took ~80% pay decreases so that I could take a break from the grind and do other things. During this time, I sourced contract work. I didn't do that for the $20k. I did it to avoid large gaps in my job history. This upcoming trip, I'm not doing that because my job has offered to take me back when I return and I don't love working on the road. My point is, if you do this, just make sure you are employable afterwards. 
- **Set a Date**: Wether you are switching jobs or taking a sabbatical, set a date and stick to it. I stayed at the first job far longer than I should have because I kept saying I would quit ""next year"". I was working in a stressful environment for subpar pay. This year, I am quitting my job during the onset of an economic downturn. This is the best time to be employed so you can contribute to your investments while the market is down. But, I already set a date and I am 100% sticking to it. 
- **The Switcheroo**: Early in my career, I always made the mistake of thinking my job gave a shit about me. Loyalty is not a valid reason to stay at a job - compensation and work-life-balance are. Each time I have made a career change, my happiness, and usually my compensation - has increased.

## **Asset Classifications**

Classification | Amount | Percent | Note
---|---| --- |----
Taxable Brokerage | $796,564 | 76.2% |
401k | $125,931 | 12% |
Cash | $55,321 | 5.3% | This money should should cover me for the next year. I am buying a parcel in Michigan in case the impending climate emergency gets out of control. 
Roth IRA | $46,494 | 4.4% |
Crypto | $12,935 | 1.2% | Doing a bit of gambling. I hit a 5x last time ($80k) so figured I would try my luck again while the market is down. 
HSA | $8,759 | 0.9% |

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/qsKgajv.png) is a pie chart of these classifications. 

Asset Classification Takeaways:

- **Boring is Better**: For the most part, I have been following the classic Boglehead approach that many of us here are following. I max out by 401k, HSA, and Roth IRA (backdoor) before contributing to my taxable brokerage. It's funny how boring this investment approach is. It's simple and lacks the dopamine hit that stock picking has. 
- **Share the Wealth**: Sometimes I get so fixated on personal finance that I forget who illiterate the average person is. I have been mentoring a few coworkers lately who have hundreds of thousands of dollars just sitting in their savings account. I haven't been telling them what to buy or anything - just explaining basics like the value of diversification and how unlikely they are to beat the index. I think it's one of the best gifts you can give someone.  
- **Luck**: I know what you are thinking. This guys numbers don't add up. A few things note here. 
  - First, I finally sold my rental house. I bought my home in 2014 for $295k. At the time, I was just being a consumer and wanted a fancy house with way too much square footage. I ended up getting super lucky on the market timing. When I sold it last year, there was $250k left on the mortgage and the buyer paid out $600k. 
  - Second, my company stock makes up a hefty chunk of my compensation at my current company. When I started (my grant date), the stock price was at $83. I sold at $200. I ended up pulling between $300k and $400k the past two year. That's how I hit $1M regardless of the market downturn.

##  **Asset Allocations**

My taxable accounts, 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA account for **$977,747**  (or **93.5%**) of my net worth. Let's take a look at what that portion of my portfolio is comprised of. 

 Asset | Amount | Percent
--- | --- | ----
VTSAX | $858,613 | 87.8%
VTIAX | $99,052 | 10.1%
Individual Stocks | $13,544 | 1.4%
VNQ | $6,538 | 0.7%

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/AYjqBtu.png) is a pie chart of these asset allocations. 

Asset Allocation Takeaways:

- **Stop Gambling**: I am down **51.4%** (**~$14,000**) on my individual stocks. I'm so stupid. I should really cut my losses and just sell all my individual stocks but I have such a hard time selling when I'm down.
- **Changing the Plan**: In my last post, I mentioned I was following the ""[Core Four Lazy Portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios#Core_four_portfolios)"". As you can see, this is no longer the case. It's partially out of laziness and partially strategic. Please tear me to shreds if you disagree with any of my moves here. 
  - I pulled out of bonds simply because I'm young and really don't mind the risk exposure at this point in my life. 
  - I stopped contributing to REIT's (VNQ) because I owned a home at the time of my last post and felt like I had enough exposure to real estate at that time. 
  - I stopped being anal about balancing my international (VTIAX) and domestic (VTSAX) exposure. Maybe I'm just being lazy.  
- **Don't Be Biased**: When my company stock vested, I help onto it for a while because I worked at the company and believed in the mission. At one point, one of my coworkers asked me if I would invest in the company if I had cash. My answer was no. I sold the next day. You get the idea.

## **Liabilities**

None! Now that I no longer have a house I am debt free. 

--- 

## **Expenses**

I'm not aggressively tracking my expenses like I used to. I have gotten so comfortable with my spending habits that I don't really see the point in focusing my energy towards extreme budgeting. 

That being said, I created [this Sankey chart](https://i.imgur.com/MH2Mt7S.png) to give you a rough idea of what my extrapolated 2022 will look like. Since I always get a bunch of questions about how I create these types of diagrams - [sankeycash.com](https://sankeycash.com/).

I still cook my meals at home. I still don't buy frivolous things. I still don't have an Amazon account. I no longer have a car. It broke down about 9 months ago and I never replaced it as I have a pretty nice bicycle I built. 

*But*, my bills have increased. 

A year ago I moved in with my girlfriend. I gave up my $600 (including bills) living situation for a $1,000 (not including bills) living situation. I pay for 75% of the groceries, bills, rent, etc. She makes far less money than I do. I care about her, want her to have a good standard of living, and I want her to be able to reach her financial goals as I have been able to. So I am happy to help. 


-- 

## **Final Thoughts**

I would just like to thank everyone in this community for the plethora of knowledge. 

I would also like to acknowledge that everyone has different circumstances: different incomes, different educations, different levels of privilege, children vs no children etc.

I hope that these posts don't come off as any sort of humble brag and I know that some of these takeaways don't apply to everyone. 

I think there's this sweet spot between building wealth and living your life and I hope everyone here finds it because lord knows everyone deserves it. I try to work towards it every day!

That's all for this time.

2022-11-16,I'm done.,"I'm done. I'm a 22M that's been coding since I was 10, lined up a software development job out of HS, in ~3 years became SDE II at Amazon. Total compensation went 90k-115k-125k-260k not including retirement contributions. In total I saved ~$400k, investment growth (happened to almost perfectly time a trade into small value AVUV from VOO which helped a lot) brought me up to my current net worth of $660k.

I got fired from Amazon a few months ago basically because I'm a garbage and defective human being that procrastinates everything to comical lengths thus unable to get any work done. And then pathologically lies to cover it up. I've looked back and realized I deliver negative value by working while personally feeling like shit for doing so, so I'm retiring. I've been trying some other jobs and work arrangements like folks suggested, but the same issues destroyed me every time even trying to work 3 hrs\wk so fuck it, I'm done.

I moved to LCOL and my expenses are staying well within my $28k\yr target. It's pretty easy since all I want to do is play video games and read webtoons, I literally haven't stepped outside in months lol.

[Here's the expense breakdown](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/330538905072041994/1037921166666506250/Screenshot_20221103_212234.png)

All utilities are included in my $825 rent payment, so that's stable. The internet here is pretty great value IDK why, but the $15\mo phone is because I switched to Mint mobile now that I've stopped ever going outside.

I burn $600\mo on food because all of it is delivered from restaurants. I'm the laziest person ever if that wasn't obvious yet.

All my gaming stuff I have rn totaled about $2000 when I bought it 2 years ago, with a 1660ti and i7-9850h which look like they'll handle most stuff coming out for another 3-5 years fairly well. I also got a Galaxy S22 for $700 which is supported for 5 years. I amortize all that to ~$500\yr for a reasonable electronics budget.

The $1250\yr for vacations and $250\yr for clothes is just the average from my adult life, really I'll probably spend less going forward considering I didn't enjoy any of those vacations a whole lot. Healthcare is the most unknown, but according to ACA estimators it should be between free (Medicaid) and $300\yr depending on how much capital gains I realize.

Maid service is only $80\mo because my standards for cleanliness are low enough that I only have it every 6 weeks. Actually at one point I went over a year without cleaning my place at all, only after moving and noticing my allergies? mysteriously disappear did I realize I should spend a little on this if possible lol.

Those with good mental math probably noticed $28k is more than 4% of $660k, and the 4% rule in the first place is quite risky considering how long of a retirement I'm looking at while not even qualifying for Social Security. I explain why it's fine and why I'm really following a 3% SWR [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/xodxgx/daily_fi_discussion_thread_monday_september_26/iq1fep0/).

Even including those attempts to find a bearable job that kept reviving my procrastination, self-loathing, etc the past months since Amazon fired me have been enjoyable...pretty sure they're the longest contiguous time I've been glad that I exist. I finally got time to end my 5 year break from StarCraft 2 and reach Grandmaster rank again (with all races this time :) and to start playing Factorio. I can't remember having as much fun as trying to survive a marathon deathworld, and I haven't even tried any mods yet. My webtoon backlog has also kept growing somehow despite reading dozens of chapters every day. I was scared I might get bored but yeah that's nowhere in sight, I'm finally just happy and excited 🥳",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-11-10,(Coast/Lean?) FIRE'd Yesterday!,"(Coast/Lean?) FIRE'd Yesterday! I've been interested in FIRE from pretty early on in my career. I worked in Insurance/Finance and while I'm good at it, I am not passionate about it, and I have a lot of hobbies that I can easily devote 100+% of my time to.

The company I was working for laid me off yesterday, and while my true FIRE number is a bit higher than where I'm at today, I have enough to take a very long break or to supplement my savings with side-gigs or part-time work. For some detail, I began my career making $63k+10% bonus in Feb 2012, and fairly steadily increased my income to $210k+20% bonus+RSUs by 2021. I'm currently 34.

I'm looking forward to being able to focus full-time on my hobbies as well as to connect more with friends and family (I haven't been terrible at this, but I could do better). I enjoy climbing, chess and running, and have a few goals related to those hobbies. Rough goals are:

-Climb a 5.13 by the end of next year (currently ~12c, but have sent 12d within the past few years)

-Place well in the U1800 section at the World Open in 2023 (I won U1500 at the North American Open and tied for 4th in the North American Open within the past 2 years)

-Run a trail 50k next year

I used to stream on twitch for SC2 before I began my career (back in 2012). I'd love to be able to supplement my savings with some income through that, but have no concrete plans at the moment. Perhaps there's still space for some chess content :)

The numbers:

Assets:

-50k Cash (TBD on how much I want to keep in cash vs. invested at any point in time)

-400k Brokerage Account

-200k 401k

Debt:
-350k Mortgage @ 2.8%, home is worth ~525k

Expenses/Budget:

-1,000 for home costs net of rent (I have two roommates and have room for a 3rd if I need to cut back expenses)

-350 groceries

-150 eating out

-250 phone bill/gym membership/car insurance

-150 gas

-TBD Health Insurance

Assuming health insurance ends up being $300/mo, this puts me at 26,400 in necessary expenses every year. At a 4% withdrawal rate on my more liquid accounts, I have 18,000 to work with. So technically not quite FIRE, but I only need to make 8,400 doing to cover those costs, plus maybe 2-3k to cover things like vacations, entertainment, replacing outdoor equipment, etc.

I'm excited to see how this goes. Worst case scenario I'll have to take a huge pay cut (probably still >$100k) and return to work in a few years. I'll make some follow-up posts here in the following years!",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-10-25,[4 year update] 38/m/single. $2.3 million. Submitted my resignation letter today. Thank you guys for the encouragement all these years.,"[4 year update] 38/m/single. $2.3 million. Submitted my resignation letter today. Thank you guys for the encouragement all these years. Hi, r/financialindependence. I posted about quitting my job in 2018 when I was 38 - I'm 42 now - to travel the world via air and the country via van after living frugally since I started working in my early 20s. Retired with about $2.3 million net worth. Here's the story so far ...

**Year 0**
https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8pv2yd/38msingle_23_million_submitted_my_resignation/

> I started working in my early 20s after getting out of grad school. Salary varied anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 during those 14 years or so. I live in a state with low cost of living and no state income tax, so I knew when I started that I could save a majority of my income if I stayed frugal and resisted lifestyle inflation. I live in the same starter home I bought around 2010 and drive an old Camry. I did a bunch of set-it-and-forget-it buying of large cap US index funds and Berkshire Hathaway and I did some individual buying of large cap bank and technology names before and after the Great Recession

**Year 1 update - I came home after volunteer work in SE Asia**
https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bk1rco/1_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

>I FIREd and quit my job in the US last year, then moved to Thailand to volunteer at a non-profit teaching English to former prostitutes and low-level criminals for tourism industry jobs. I'm an American, ethnically Chinese.

>My apartment and utilities were provided for free by the non-profit and I lived with my fellow expat volunteers. Some were older couples who wanted their privacy, so they booked their own apartments. Costs ranged from as low as $200 a month for a cheap, non-furnished studio apartment to $375 a month for a furnished studio in a newer building near a Skytrain station in the center of town with security. I was pleasantly surprised that because I was in the country on a sponsored work visa, I was eligible to buy health insurance there as a local. It came out to about $150 a month. Getting international expat health insurance here in America would have cost me up to $500 a month, so a huge savings. I also rarely ate at home and never cooked, since Bangkok is one of the great street food capitals of the world. All kinds of Thai, Chinese, Malay, Indian and Arab food served on the street for about 35 to 70 baht each entree (~1 to 2 bucks USD). I ended up not getting a local cell phone or local cell plan, my Sprint plan included international roaming and the 2G data was okay for Google Maps and web/email use when I was away from wifi, which was rare.
So monthly fixed expenses came out to

> * $150 health insurance

> * $200 eating out

> * $100 7-Eleven (drinking tap water actively discouraged by authorities due to corroded pipes. Bottled water is substantially cheaper there than here, thankfully. My problem is that when I went into 7-Eleven every day to get the cheap water, I would get sidetracked by whatever tasty unfamiliar snack I would see at the hot food counter that I would then have to try, hence $100 a month blown. Seriously, 7-Eleven in Thailand is amazing, I highly recommend getting lost in one. All kinds of hot noodle soups and baos and sticky rice snacks and cakes.)

> * $150 Skytrain and subway tickets, Uber/Grab app rides on the back of a motorcycle.

> * $250 random spending money on cheap knock-off clothes or gifts to take home or a ladyboy cabaret show or a concert or pro kickboxing match, etc.

> * =$850/month total. Let's say I had to get my own furnished apartment and pay for my utilities, add another $500 a month. $1,350 a month total is pretty good considering I lived like a king and didn't budget myself at all. I could get that below $1,000 a month if I was more frugal.

> My non-fixed expenses were for airfare and lodging when I would leave town for the weekend to explore the rest of SE Asia. If I could book trips early enough, I could get round trip flights on Scoot or AirAsia to Chiang Rai or Singapore or Penang for as little as $40 round trip. Other than Singapore, Airbnbs and budget hotels were dirt cheap, so those weekend trips rarely cost more than $200 each.

> Also - about three or four months after I moved to Thailand, my former boss called me to see how I was and offered me an online-only job, where I would spend about an hour to 90 minutes a day remotely reviewing other people's work, answering internal emails and listening to ideas he would bounce off of me. I wasn't interested, but he insisted it would not be my old job, that I would still be a digital nomad and never come into the office and I would be eligible for 401k matching and the company's health insurance when I came home. So I said yes and I've been doing the job for about half a year. It's been as advertised, I set aside an hour or so a night on my laptop in front of the TV and it hasn't grown into anything bigger yet. The salary is a small, small fraction of what I used to make but it's worth my time. We'll see how things stand after another year.

**Year 2 update - I was in COVID lockdown**
https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gwhxgh/2_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

> 2020 comes and COVID-19 hits. My trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong was cancelled. A trip to Italy soon after, too. Then separate trips to Nevada and Boston, too. My net worth skyrocketed to over $3 million thanks to the post-China trade deal rally and the market assuming COVID-19 is contained. The abrupt, panicked selloff as the world went into lockdown knocked me back down to $2.1 million. Painful, but I rode the Great Recession all the way down and back ten years ago, so I had that experience to rely on to resist panic selling. I've since rode the April/May rally back up to $2.6 million. https://i.imgur.com/Wg7c74L.jpg

> My current expenses ... I own the house outright so no rent is great. Health insurance is covered by my old employer (while still in SE Asia, I was offered a remote work job by my old boss, like set aside 60-90 minutes a day to answer email and have him bounce ideas off of me. I originally said no but was swayed when told I could get health insurance covered and my 401k matching when I moved back to the states, have done it since. A nice side hustle for a fraction of my old salary.)

> * $480 a month for property taxes and home insurance. That's right, per month. Property taxes are high here, the joys of home ownership.

> * $70 a month for auto insurance, two cars, two drivers.

> * $130 gasoline and auto maintenance. They're Toyotas, maintenance is really easy and the engines will run forever.

> * $220 water, internet and power.

> * $120 a month for four smartphones on a Sprint family plan. Yes, Sprint sucks but it's a great price that I've been grandfathered into for several years. I get a free Hulu sub and a free AAA sub with it, too.

> * $140 groceries. I shop mostly at Aldi and grow several greens and fruits in my backyard.

> * $60 for random upkeep around the house. Replacing a broken sprinkler head, buying wood chips, replacing a broken weedeater guard, batteries, light bulbs, buy a bag of potting soil, stuff like that.

> * = $1,220/month. I'm not including eating out or going to shows or movies because I'm inside the house all day every day. My $20 gym membership is suspended, I don't want to work out in an enclosed space until there's a vaccine or proven treatment.

**Year 3 update -**I didn't post an update because things had not changed much from the year before. Omicron had people home in Texas dropping dead left and right and I didn't feel comfortable flying domestically or internationally again. So I did a lot of camping trips at state parks in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas. It was nice. Lots of exploring in towns like Taos and Durant and Turkey. Spent a lot of time with family.

**Today, Year 4 update** - I finally started flying again in the spring and picked up right where I left off in 2020. I went to a friend's wedding in New York City and I had such a great time that I later signed on as an unpaid volunteer with NY Cares. I'm currently based in Queens and I'll be here into December helping high schoolers and their Mandarin or Spanish-speaking families fill out their FAFSA applications. Enjoying myself very much. I'm basically a tourist all day and night. Eating lots of cheap $2 pork dumplings and $7 halal food in Astoria and Flushing and Sunset Park. Going to a lot of museums and art galleries in Manhattan.

**Net worth today -** I've been on a wild ass ride since 2018 that has been bewildering and head-spinning. $2.3 million at retirement, rallied to above $3 million at the pre-COVID peak. The lockdown selloff was brutal, I was back to $2.1 million pretty quickly by summer 2020. I then put my hoarded cash to work in more big bank, tech names and leveraged ETF plays hoping to claw back to over $3 million within three years. I was floored that it ballooned to over $10 million on the backs of those leveraged bank and tech plays going parabolic and leading the market as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero (thanks ""transient inflation"") and QE going for substantially longer than anyone expected.

https://i.imgur.com/eJbG1Vx.jpeg

I was shocked by the huge move higher because I grossly misjudged just how many rounds of stimulus Congress was going to pass, misjudged how long the Fed was going to ignore spiking inflation and misjudged how much central banks and lawmakers in other countries would going along with similar measures, further juicing global financial markets. You are welcome to view my post history for the past two years, as I post about some specific bank and tech trades I made.

Well, that's all crashed and burned in 2022. The steady 75-basis point interest hikes beginning in the spring by the Fed to kill the +8% inflation we are enduring have torpedoed the bank and tech names in my portfolio. I'm currently at about $6.1 million, a $4 million loss from the peak. Yes, it has been exceptionally painful. I've done some selling on the rallies and other selling on stop-loss orders being triggered.

https://i.imgur.com/EjmMPz9.jpg

But, whatever. I knew these trades I entered into in 2020 were high risk, high reward. And I'm up over 100% on my net worth since I retired four years ago. If you would have told me then that my nest egg would balloon to over $6 million within five years, I would have done backflips. The fact that it spiked to over $10 million before losing $4 million in value doesn't bother me as much as it should. I'm pretty much over it, at this point. I'm happy with myself that I've always kept at least $400,000 in cash on hand because it gives me the luxury now of looking over my shopping list for new names to enter into 2023. No clue when the bottom will be, I have increased my 401k contributions to the $20,500 maximum in the meantime.

I am still bullish in the long term of the big US banks. Banks because we are in a sharp rate hike cycle, meaning retail banking is very profitable for the first time in over 15 years because interest rates are high and will honestly never go back to being near-zero for so long. Wells Fargo has the largest (proportion) retail banking operation out of them all and has lagged for over a decade because of it, it's been my top pick since the Fed started hiking in May-ish. Reasons to bet against big banks are if the recession is deeper and harder than expected. Obviously.

**Current cost of living -** I'm currently staying in Elmhurst, Queens. It's about $1,400/month for a private room and shared bathroom, I booked on Airbnb. I highly recommend Airbnb for monthly stays, many hosts slash their asking rate 40 to 60% if you commit for that long. Huge pluses are I'm right next to a station for the 7 train and there is washer/dryer in house.

* $200/month for transportation. I ride the subway with an unlimited weekly pass loaded on a MetroCard. And will take the occasional taxi or rideshare. Yes, I know about the spike in stabbings and platform pushers in the news constantly. Yes, there seems like fewer police and more mentally ill folks than before the pandemic. Luckily haven't witnessed anything yet, just need to stay mindful.

* $600/month for food. I am eating out every day, there's cheap ethnic food everywhere in Queens. I can save and diet when I go home.

* $250/month on attractions. I'm not spending much on attractions. There's so many free things to do in the city, it's pretty amazing. You can burn several days touring the free private art galleries in Chelsea or half a day walking the Brooklyn Bridge and back or walking in Coney Island or taking the free Staten Island ferry. The big pay museums have certain free hours blocked off every week. I did buy the occasional Mets tickets or pay to see a local band or pay the table minimum at the Comedy Cellar.

* $120/month for the same four-phone family plan.

* =$2,570/month. Health insurance still covered by part-time remote gig.

2022-10-13,What do folks feel about all the future downward pressure on growth?,"What do folks feel about all the future downward pressure on growth? This isn’t another “what should the safe withdrawal rate” be thread. I’m actually interested in hearing peoples’ opinions about how they have figured what their annual compounding rate will be going forward vs just that 10%ish was the historical rate. The last 80 or so years had several huge things that really pushed growth in ways I don’t see many equivalents for happening in the future:

1. The adoption and widespread use of fossil fuels for industry
2. Women entering the workforce
3. Large growing populations of consumers in the developed world (now we have population collapse coming in most developed and even some developing countries)
4. The invention of the internet and widespread adoption
5. The general slow down of the introduction of “life changing tech” (think iPhones being invented vs Apple just releasing a new model every year)
6. Low levels of debt in all categories compared to the record levels we see today all over the world.

I’m genuinely interested in hearing what people feel will be the big drivers of growth in the next 80 years. I think things like AI, Space Colonization, and a few other things have lots of potential, but I see a lot more things with no wheels like the Metaverse out there as well. I’m not a doomer who thinks there will be no growth, but I am skeptical that we will see the same rates as we did in the past.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-10-13,8 Years of Tracking | Started Investing 3 Years Ago | On Track to FIRE in 26 Years? | 150k NW @24,"8 Years of Tracking | Started Investing 3 Years Ago | On Track to FIRE in 26 Years? | 150k NW @24 Good morning r/financialindependence!

**Advice Needed**

* While I am not for sure exactly what age I want or will retire, I'd like to plan to be able to retire at 50 and withdraw $60k-$80k per year. After reading my situation below, am I doing enough and am I on track to FIRE at 50? I have always generally invested Roth dollars where applicable the past few years but now my income is increasing which will bump me up tax brackets and possibly even phase me out of contributing to a Roth IRA. What can you recommend as far as investing Roth dollars or traditional dollars? I currently max a Roth IRA and I go 50/50 Roth/Traditional dollars in my 457(b). I'm sure there are things that I am forgetting or not accounting for so would like some advice. Can I be comfortable enough with my TMRS, Roth IRA, and 457(b) or do I need to be investing extra dollars into my brokerage?
* I don't come from parents that know that much about retirement so I thankfully have come across this and other subreddits which have taught me so much by reading from others.

**Overview**

* I am currently 24 years old and have a net worth of roughly $150k. I am currently single and rent an apartment (no desire for roommates). I am currently trying to save for a house and new vehicle. I also need to currently re-up my emergency savings (I previously tapped it to invest it during a market downturn (bad decision since it's an emergency fund) and I never put back into it.
* Current Income: $83k pretax not including overtime or contract work (through September 2022 I've brought in around $63k (W2) post tax and $6.7k (1099) pre tax). I estimate to earn an additional $15k post tax (W2) and $21.8k (1099) pretax for the remainder of the year. In two years, my income should increase to around $97k (W2) pretax not including unlimited overtime and I estimate to earn an additional $70k in contract 1099 work starting next year until I decide to cut back.
* Current emergency fund: $1k. Current cash holding: $9k.

**Debts**

* I currently have no debts.

**TMRS Contributions**

* Total balance through September 2022: $33k. I put 7% pretax in (cannot change) and my employer puts in 14% pretax for a total of 21% per paycheck. I cannot manage what this is invested in and by law it is guaranteed 5% interest annually.
* Estimated monthly withdrawal in 2048: (Max: $4.9k Min: $3.9k)/Month for life. The discrepancy depends on if I wish to have survivor benefits at my passing and/or a lump sum payment at retirement. NOTE: This estimate takes into account my current W2 income and does not account for raises (I'll be at $97k without OT in 2 years. Pay caps at $102k if I don't promote).

**457(b) Contributions**

* Current balance through September 2022: $33.8k. Will be maxed out for the year next paycheck and I plan to max this every year going forward. Contributions are 50% Roth and 50% Pretax. No employer match.
* Vanguard 500 Index Admiral 85%
* Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Admiral 9%
* Vanguard Small-Cap Index Admiral 6%

**Roth IRA Contributions**

* Current balance through September 2022: $24.5k. Already maxed for the year and plan to max going forward but if I make my expected 1099 income next year, I assume I'll be ineligible.
* GOOG 5%
* AMZN 3%

Hello, I was excited to make my 1 year update post when I quit my job at the beginning of the year, but I wanted to say something different than just the numbers and our story (don’t worry they’re still below), so I’ve thought about it for more than half the year.

Married couple 40s, 2 kids (5yr and 3yr). Wife working \~100k, husband quit, net worth 1.5 million, USA. Inherited 600k. 253k mortgage owed, house value $320k, 30 year conventional 2.875%, no car payments, no other debt, credit cards always paid in full each month. Paid off $300k in student loans.

While approaching my planned quitting, it was hard to find information on what I should be planning and when to quit other than for traditional retirement. I did find it in fire blogs and YouTube channels after some searching. Most were successful fire personalities with income from that, but they all tended to agree that they found income after quitting and leaving a little before reaching your fi/fire number is good. So I agreed I didn’t need to stick it out yet another year, especially with kindergarten starting this year, and being very ready to leave my job.

On the other side, I think back to when I started a fire type journey, when I started worrying about my finances, back to my first job, and even my first allowance for cutting the grass. I see a lot of younger people interested in fire, so I’ll give my thoughts on it. I have a paper from my last year of college where I listed out my finances and had a negative net worth of $8k. (Could have been much worst, but my wife had 300k in loans we worked on for years after getting married) Even with a first salary of $55k, and my next job even less at $45k, my goals were to focus on my career and work/life balance (never found a job I wanted to stay at or balance, but I do have some good memories, accomplishments, and friends from work). I just wanted to keep my finances under control, not become wealthy, and just end up with enough to retire normally at 65 or something. I had just started at the 2008 crash, in IT, in a finance company. It was hard getting each of my next jobs, usually taking 6 months of interviewing and searching each time. Only towards the last few years did I make twice as much because I was focused on the salary and benefits. The benefits helped with fire more than a large salary, but you often don't know the details until you're already hired. My wife’s student loans led me to learning about all things finance and increased my worries. When she started paying them I could see the loan companies would lower the minimum payment over time and the math seemed like she’d end up owing more over time, a million dollars, not ever paying them off! I decided we needed to do nothing but pay them off and we did over 4 years (a mutual decision and all our finances combined). I did think to keep our finances separate, but I also started listening to Dave Ramsey at the time and decided to do everything together, only after we actually married. I learned a lot from Dave and even though I wouldn’t exactly follow much of his advice today, its a good place to start and still enjoy listening to a show every once in a while. I paid for his advisor once while still paying down loans and needing a new car and the person basically said we already have it figured out, but why keep these small stashes of cash around, pay off the loans (I would keep some extra emergency funds in my bank, money market, etc) and I had to let that go to the loans. Which I did. We had a 200k net worth once they were paid off, nearly all in my 401k's.

I think fire is a noble pursuit and at the same time not exactly right for someone in high school or even college. Yet, I’d recommend it as a goal. Goals are good to have as long as you leave room for flexibility and changes. You can eat rice and beans and forgo vacations in the pursuit of fire and even push yourself, as long as you also let yourself have a break, a splurge, etc. Learning from the corporate world, I made a BHAG (big hairy audacious/aggressive goal) after we paid off the student loans to grow our net worth the same way, but using an aggressive 12% return as the goal in addition to our contributions. We were behind our target every month for another 4 years and then the market jumped up and we surpassed it! We hit $1 million net worth this year (down to $800k with market back down). Looking back I never would have believed it was possible with my career, abilities, and our debt. Having a big goal changes your decisions, lets you see opportunities you normally wouldn’t see or look for, and ultimately changes your path. Yes, we’ve been lucky, bull market, careers, but there was no indication when we set out our goals that we were going to have the recent bull market, so luck favors the prepared.

We took a vacation right away, not because of quitting but because of an invite and timing working out. After a week or two I was starting to wind down from work mode. Not having to be oncall for the first time in like a decade was freeing and weird. I kept snapping back to panicking I don’t have my phone on me then realizing I can leave it on a table.

I thought I’d be eager to get back to doing some kind of work, even as a hobby. Normally when away from tech I want to get back into a project. That hasn’t happened and now I’m feeling less and less likely I’ll go back to the work I did with computers/tech, but who knows. Although my time is now filled with household projects.

I settled into getting things done around the house, food shopping during the week and taking care of more things during the week so we could start enjoying our weekends more.

Then, my dad passed away. I was able to focus on helping him before he passed because I was not working. I’ll never get that back and more than one person said thank god you’re not at that job right now.

We just inherited 600k bringing us to 1.5 million, but it really just gets rolled into the plan, and we may have reached that in 2 years without it. In the inherited IRA I’ll be taking equal amounts out over 10 years (IRS rule they take 50% if you don’t withdraw by end of 10 years). It's taxed as ordinary income so needs to be spread out over the years to reduce our yearly federal taxes. The plan with that is to invest half over 4 years, a bit each month. With this amount, I’m playing with individual stocks now, the majority of our investments are in index funds. The other half, over those first 4 years, will come out each month and go into VTI index in brokerage. At that point, I'll reassess and decide to keep doing stocks with that 20% of our net worth, or just go back to index funds. I’m reading about investing now, one book I really liked is 100-Baggers by Christopher Mayer.

That’s about it for now. I spend my time working on things around the house, projects, spending time with kids, researching investments, and getting used to the new routine. Any questions, please ask!",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-09-24,2 yr Update: I left a FAANG pre-FI for a more fulfilling job and took more than a 50% pay cut,"2 yr Update: I left a FAANG pre-FI for a more fulfilling job and took more than a 50% pay cut TL/DR: I like my job, but also mental health is really important.

Edit: in case this confuses anyone else, the timestamp on my old post is showing up as 1yr ago on some devices. I believe this is because it was technically poster 1yr 11mo ago and some versions of Reddit app round down to the nearest full year. But it was indeed written in October 2020, and this is a (nearly) 2 year update.

In October 2020, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jhe6va/i_left_a_faang_prefi_for_a_more_fulfilling_job/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) here that was fairly well received. I wrote that post 9 months after leaving a FAANG and, as the title says, I took more than a 50% pay cut, pre-FI, for a more fulfilling job. I’ve been thinking about doing an update post for the past year or so, and now the time feels right enough. Quick financial recap: Back then I was 25 years old, NW of around 200k-ish, and I felt I was just about coastFI. Now I am 27 years old, unsure of exact NW, especially now that I have to consider house equity, mortgage debt, and recent market volatility, but it’s gone up a decent amount - maybe to 240-270k depending on how you count the home equity (and if you consider markets from a month ago and not time of posting lol). Basically I’ve been able to save some, but not as much as I’d like - who’da thunk it’s harder to save money on a lower salary.

# What’s happened since October 2020?

I’ll start with some life updates. Apologies in advance for being a wall of text / stream of consciousness. I’ll put reflections later - this paragraph is intended to just be an info dump of the last 2 years. When writing that last post, my partner (now ex) and I were weeks from closing on a house. The closing went well, and I love the house. It is an old house (1910’s), but so far have had no issues. Since closing, property values have gone way up - just got a HELOC based on a valuation about 30% higher than we bought. I should be able to remove PMI next month, at the 2 year mark. My sister, who lives down the street, had my first nibling a bit over a year ago, and being an uncle has been wonderful. I am still working at the same place, still remote. My responsibilities kept expanding until I finally felt justified in asking for a title change to CTO, which was approved without question; it’s not super meaningful at a small research nonprofit (< 8 full time employees, but many part time and volunteers), but my previous title was pretty obscure so it’s great to have something clear and an obvious career progression for me. My salary has increased to about 103k - you may recall that my starting salary was 88k; not too shabby, but not tech sector executive level either! I now manage, at any given time, 3-6 part time engineers and student interns. I manage several projects, write statements of work for the consulting arm I started, manage some IT related stuff (I’m not the primary IT person at the org though), and individually contribute. As foreshadowed before, my partner and I have (recently) split up. I’ll get into that more later, but for now, I’ll just say we are on fairly good terms, and it didn’t financially wreck me.

# Brief review of October 2020 post

While rereading the old [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jhe6va/i_left_a_faang_prefi_for_a_more_fulfilling_job/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I’d say I was (perhaps cautiously) optimistic about the future and the choices I’d made then. My takeaways were that I liked my job more than my FAANG job, but it was still a job. Some gushy statements about values, purpose, and fulfillment, and having faith in the future.

# Do I still feel the same way?

In a lot of ways, yes. In the last year, I’ve actually come to enjoy my new job more. At the time of writing the old post, I was being pushed to work on this one project that I grew to really dislike. Once that was finally over, things got a lot better. I eventually started a consulting arm of our nonprofit, where we help apply our research methods to other academic projects as contractors. I’ve been managing engineers in a much more real capacity, and I’ve found it really fulfilling. I significantly helped in this one grant application, which, if we get, could mean a fairly significant expansion to the org. I am still regularly coding interesting things as well, and generally working easy hours.

The main thing that deviates from the points of my old post is that caring for my mental health was just as, if not more, important than having a job I found fulfilling (and, of course, the two are likely related in several ways). I’ve come to realize that I have had significant depression and anxiety, probably since I was a teenager. While I’d been to therapy a few times even before writing my last post, I never really got much out of it. It wasn’t until the Fall of 2021, when I finally talked to my doctor about it, was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, prescribed meds, and even took FMLA (medical leave), that things really started to improve for me. Just existing is not supposed to feel like a major struggle every single day! It’s such a simple statement but it’s really something that’s easy to forget when you’re depressed, especially when it’s been your “normal” for years or decades.

My meds (an SSRI and a mild stimulant) really helped me from being stuck in such a low place. My improved mental state, therapy, and some shocking life events (the sudden, unexpected passing of my grandmother, and a cancer event with my sister (she’s doing well now!)) really brought some perspective in my life, which eventually culminated with me realizing how unhappy I was in my relationship. Since this is not r/relationshipadvice, I won’t get too much into relationship details, but I’ll say that my relationship was keeping me from doing a lot of things I wanted to do, and kept me stuck in some poor habits (that really fed my anxiety and depression) that were formed when I was mentally ill teenager. I have no ill will toward my ex.

Since this is a financial subreddit, I’ll briefly go over the financial details of the breakup. We were not married, but we shared a house and vehicle. The house was technically in my name only, but we would have bought it together if it wasn’t for my ex being between jobs due to COVID at the time of applying for financing; we split costs and always treated it as co-owned. So, I’ve bought out their equity in the house and the car (subtracting some money that they owed me from something unrelated). All in all, it put me out < 25k; it’s not really a life-changing amount, but it’s nontrivial.

Now that I have significantly better mental health, I am looking back at my career pivot with some more perspective. I still think it was a good choice, and probably the best for me at the time, given my poor mental state. However, I suspect I could have managed working my “unfulfilling” FAANG job if I had better mental health at the time. It was actually kind of an epiphany moment that led me to leave the job (in part from a self-help-ish book that I still very much appreciate), but given my extreme history with depression, what I think I needed more than anything was medication! Don’t get me wrong, I made great strides with self-reflection and learning to process my emotions. But, at least for me, my upbringing as an LGBTQ individual in a Catholic Texan family did not leave me well equipped to handle life without some significant intervention.

So, I am doing much better now, mentally, and am more optimistic than ever about the future. I am back into a good fitness routine. I am going past my comfort zone and making new friends - something I found extremely difficult to do before with my anxiety, depression, and being able to use my relationship as a crutch. I don’t regret my career choices, and I really enjoy my job now. I also feel that, if I wanted or needed to, I could probably go back to the tech sector and get a pretty good job, coming in as a CTO with the diversity of experience I now have. Or, perhaps I’d be able to freelance / househack my way into coasting. (Or, as a young new single, marry rich!)

A caveat to all this good, though, is that from a pure financial perspective, these QOL improvements might not be a good thing; my poor mental health in a lot of ways gave me tunnel vision for FI. Now, I am spending quite a bit more and saving less as I explore a lot of things I had not before. But, maybe that’s as it should be ?

# Conclusion?

I don’t know that I have a clear takeaway here, other than *really* investigate your mental health whenever you feel you really *need* a big life change. I’m not saying you shouldn’t trust your perceptions, knowledge, and beliefs, but if you’re fortunate enough to have decent food, a non-toxic home, and a non-toxic job that pays enough, yet still feel like it’s a struggle just to exist in the world, something isn’t right - and it might not be as straightforward a fix as a new job or new chore schedule.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-08-31,WSJ: How To Retire During A Scary Stock Market,"WSJ: How To Retire During A Scary Stock Market It’s basically an interview with Wade Pfau on the 4% rule and the sequence of returns risk:

Re­tir­ing dur­ing a mar­ket down­turn and soar­ing in­fla­tion can feel like sail­ing into the wind in­stead of the sun­set. 

The mar­ket’s per­for­mance in the first few years of re­tire­ment can have a big im­pact on how long a nest egg lasts, partly be­cause losses take a big­ger bite out of a port­fo­lio when it is typ­i­cally at its largest, ad­vis­ers and econ­o­mists say. 

Of course, it isn’t al­ways pos­si­ble to time your re­tire­ment to co­in­cide with a bull mar­ket.

But those near­ing re­tire­ment right now can take some com­fort in re­search that shows that even peo­ple who re­tired in the worst time to do so since 1926 would have made their money last 30 years by stick­ing to cer­tain rules. As the sto­ries of the four re­tirees The Wall Street Jour­nal pro­filed this week show, even those who re­tired in 2008 have done fine pro­vided they man­aged their money well. 

Neg­a­tive re­turns at the start of re­tire­ment, when a port­fo­lio is usu­ally largest, cre­ate a prob­lem be­cause the com­bi­na­tion of mar­ket losses and with­drawals can leave a port­fo­lio too de­pleted to last decades.

“The five years af­ter re­tire­ment are a piv­otal pe­riod for de­ter­min­ing a sus­tain­able life­style in re­tire­ment,” said Wade Pfau, a pro­fes­sor at the Amer­i­can Col­lege of Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices in King of Prus­sia, Pa., and au­thor of “Re­tire-ment Plan­ning Guide­book.”

Con­sider a 62-year-old who re­tired on Jan. 1 with $1 mil­lion and is fol­low­ing the 4% rule to de­ter­mine how much to spend in re­tire­ment. (Such an ap­proach, which has been ques­tioned re­cently, calls for spend­ing 4% of a bal­ance in the first year of re­tire­ment and ad­just­ing that amount in sub­se­quent years to ac­count for in­fla­tion.) 

Af­ter tak­ing the first an­nual with­drawal of 4%, or $40,000, the in­vestor would have $960,000 left. With a 15% loss in the first year, the bal­ance would fall to $816,000. Two more years of sim­i­lar with­drawals and 15% losses would leave about $527,000 to last po­ten­tially for decades.

By con­trast, a 62-year-old who re­tires with $1 mil­lion and ex­pe­ri­ences 15% an­nual gains would have about $1.36 mil­lion af­ter three years of $40,000 with­drawals.

De­spite the mar­ket’s im­por­tance in early re­tire­ment, his­tory shows that the port­fo­lios of peo­ple who re­tire in down mar­kets can re­cover.

Thanks to the long bull mar­ket and low in­fla­tion that fol­lowed the fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2008, some­one with 50% in stocks who re­tired with $1 mil­lion on Jan. 1, 2007, and spent $40,000, ad­justed an­nu­ally for in­fla­tion, would have had about $874,000 left af­ter two years, but would have about $1.63 mil­lion to­day.

“As long as you didn’t panic and sell your stocks in 2008 you’d be do­ing fine to­day,” said Mr. Pfau, who crunched the num­bers for a port­fo­lio with 50% in U.S. large-cap stocks and 50% in in­ter­me­di­ate-term U.S. gov­ern­ment bonds.

An­other les­son for re­tirees con­tend­ing with losses is to cut spend­ing if pos­si­ble, since “if you’re over­spend­ing from a port­fo­lio that is si­mul­ta­ne­ously dwin­dling, that just leaves less in place to re­pair it­self when the mar­kets even­tu­ally re­cover,” said Chris­tine Benz, di­rec­tor of per­sonal fi­nance at Morn­ingstar Inc.

The worst 30-year pe­riod in which to re­tire be­gan in the late 1960s. Those who re­tired then were clob­bered with back-to-back bear mar­kets that started around 1969 and 1973, plus years of high in­fla­tion. These fac­tors caused many to drain their nest eggs faster than they would have oth­er­wise, al­though many in that era were able to fall back to some ex­tent on tra­di­tional pen­sion ben­e­fits.

If mar­kets slide and in­fla­tion re­mains high for the next cou­ple of years, as some econ­o­mists have pre­dicted, Mr. Pfau said it could cre­ate “the per­fect storm,” leav­ing in­vestors with a choice be­tween with­draw­ing more from a shrink­ing port­fo­lio or cut­ting spend­ing to try to pro­tect their nest eggs even as prices rise.

Here are steps re­tirees can take to im­prove their odds of mak­ing their money last:

Cut spend­ing when mar­kets de­cline

The 4% rule would have pro­tected re­tirees from run­ning out of money even in the worst 30 year pe­riod since 1926 in which to re­tire, which turned out to be from 1966 to 1995, ac­cord­ing to Mr. Pfau.

For cur­rent re­tirees, Mr. Pfau rec­om­mends for­go­ing in­fla­tion ad­just­ments fol­low­ing any year in which your port­fo­lio in­curs losses.

“A very small change in spend­ing can have a dra­matic ef­fect,” said Mr. Pfau.

For ex­am­ple, some­one who re­tired in 1966 and stuck to the 4% rule would have run out of money af­ter 30 years. But by spend­ing 3.8% to start in­stead, the in­vestor would have pre­served most of his or her orig­i­nal nest egg by year 30, he said.

Man­age volatil­ity

Peo­ple en­ter­ing re­tire­ment of­ten have 40% to 60% or more in stocks to help their nest eggs grow.

A 2014 study by re­searchers in­clud­ing Mr. Pfau finds that those who start re­tire­ment by re­duc­ing their stock­hold­ings to 20% to 30% of their port­fo­lio and then grad­u­ally push it back up to 50% to 70% in stocks have the high­est prob­a­bil­ity of mak­ing their money last 30 years us­ing the 4% spend­ing rule. 

Those who take a dif­fer­ent ap­proach, ta­per­ing stock­hold­ings from 60% to 30%, are likely to run out of money af­ter 28 years in the worst-case sce­nar­ios, ac­cord­ing to the re­search.

2022-08-04,11.5 Years post FIRE half year update,"11.5 Years post FIRE half year update  This will be cross posted in a few FIRE related reddits, so if you see it somewhere else, nothing is different. Slightly late this time, because I wanted to include a few lifestyle updates that weren't settled at the six month mark.

I always begin these updates with the same disclaimer that I don't have a specific FIRE date since I was self employed before retirement and slowly dissolved my business over time and started investing in real estate. I use the 2010 time frame for reference because it is around the time I hired a property manager (thus leaving me zero active work to do unless I choose), but it certainly isn't exact.

This isn't meant as a comparison to anyone else. This is strictly provided to the FIRE community because I know I would have liked to have seen real world example of how people handle their finances when I was trying to figure all this out many years ago. Another reason I post these is to show there is more than one way to do FIRE. I was able to accomplish this without ever making a high income during my working years. I simply lived very frugally and put the money I saved into individual stocks (hey, it was 80s - 90s...I didn't know better and stock investing was a completely different animal back then) and then converted that to buying rental properties in a low cost of living area in the 2000s.

Quick stats: I'm 56, single, no kid's, about 11 years post FIRE.

**WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE MY LAST UPDATE**

Turns out a lot has changed this time!

Bought a new car. A 2022 Hybrid Elantra. I swore I would never buy a new car, but this time the math actually made sense. The warranty is an incredible 10 year bumper to bumper, then lifetime drivetrain. So realistically no expenses outside of gas and routine maintenance (even that is covered for 3 years). So far I'm getting over 65 mpg...so between zero repair bills and much less in gas, it should pay for itself over those first 10 years. (for reference I was averaging about $2k per year in repairs on my other cars) Since I've been driving much more over the past couple of years, the savings should really add up. We'll see. My total all in price including licensing, taxes, and the extended warranty was right at $31,000. I chose to pay it off in cash after getting the $500 financing rebate. Over the next few months I plan to sell off a few of my previous driver collector cars to fully pay for it, but until then I am showing that as an expense for the year. My insurance is going up from the previous $45 to $125 per month (that is with all my cars that are not in storage still covered...I will drop some of those as I sell them.)

I hired a cleaner. This is going to cost me $50 every three weeks...for simplicity lets call that $75 a month. I am not great at the deep cleaning of my house and things like dusting and getting in all the nooks and crannies, although I'm pretty good at keeping the clutter to a minimum and keeping the floors clean. I find it hard to justify a real house keeping service, so hopefully this targeted approach using an independent cleaner will do the job. She starts this weekend, so we'll see how it goes.

I've continued to grow the real estate business, with several new projects now in the works keeping my team busy...while I sit around and enjoy the retired life, lol. In fairness, I do look at potential houses in person and discuss what I want done with my team, but after that I rarely have any hands on involvement outside of the rare big picture decision.

**INCOME**

I'll wait to go into net income details at year end.

**GROWTH AND NET WORTH**

My growth in my investments so far this year. Keep in mind this numbers reflect the sharp downturn in the markets.

High Dividend Stock account began the year at $$169,774.19. I invest $100 per day into it. It currently is at $127,812.49

Broad Market Index fund account began the year at $394,610.11. I invest $200 per day into it. It currently is at $274,030.49

My Fundrise account started the year at $78,778. I invested a total of $14,000 so far this year. It is currently at $99,867

My real estate (rentals) is very difficult to estimate since I have partners on some of the houses and some I own outright. Not to mention it isn't a liquid asset. I usually just judge it by the income it produces...that being said it does have a value that adds to my net worth. I'll be conservative and say my real estate portfolio is worth $2M - $2.5M. I do not hold debt on the portfolio. Everything is owned outright without loans of any sort. This includes some sharp increases in property values over the past couple of years.

My personal property (the house and 10 acres of land I live on) is worth about $450k - $500k...again as a conservative estimate. A house similar to mine, but in my opinion not quite as appealing, recently sold for over $750,000.

I have misc. accounts totaling around $45K...this is a small Acorn account, another stock account I use for experiments in investing, and my liquid accounts that I use for personal and business expenses. I keep more in a ""cash"" bank account than most because I need to cover business expenses. I try to keep around $20K in there, but it will fluctuate greatly throughout the month to as low as $7 or 8K, to sometimes as high as $30k. I currently have another $4k in a money market fund. I have this for quick liquidity when needed. This also varies greatly and will be as high as $50K at times.

Not going to bother with my cars and other misc. on this update. This brings my total net worth as of this update to around $3,00,000 (using the conservative estimates above)- $3,500,000. So, stocks are down since last update, real estate is up...which results in a fairly significant gain overall.

**EXPENSES**

I spent a total average of $672 per month on all non business related expenses so far this year. This came in slightly under my goal of $800 per month, or $10K per year. This does NOT reflect the new car purchase. I have not averaged that into the monthly expenses since I hope to offset that expense by selling some other cars before year end. It did result in higher insurance, but less gas...so those almost perfectly offset from the previous months.

These numbers are updated to reflect the current expenses, even though these are some fairly recent changes.

Phone/Internet $25 (Visible wireless with unlimited hotspot for internet)

Insurance on my cars $125 (3 cars liability only, 1 full coverage)

Food/groceries $100 (I've done some detailed food budget breakdowns if you're curious how I keep this so low)

Electric $125 - $150 (average throughout the year/ all electric house)

House cleaner $75

I have my own well and septic tank, so no bills for water, sewerage, and trash.

Gas for cars $50. I spent quite a bit more on gas in the last few months before buying the hybrid, so my gas budget went up quite a bit. It was about $150 before buying the hybrid. This is mainly due to looking at more houses for the business, semi local trips for hiking/and or entertainment. (everything within 100 miles, but it does add up)

Entertainment $100. I hate to give this it's own line in the budget, but I do sometimes spend on entertainment, so although this is no way a true reflection of what I spent last year, I am including it because everyone asks, lol. Most of my entertainment ends up being ""free"" or nearly free other than the gas it takes to go places.

Health Insurance is a free (for now) catastrophic plan. Thanks to all my real estate deductions I get to write off most of my income, leaving me just able to qualify for the absolute worst plan available in my state for free. Of course, if one little thing goes wrong at tax time and I step over the threshold at the end of the year, that could change and I'll be left paying for a plan I've never used.

That brings me to $600 or so monthly on ""set"" expenses, that give me plenty for any one time expenses that come up...and that $100 entertainment rarely gets used...so most months I have $300 for whatever comes up. Some months are under, so months are over, but my goal is to keep it under $800. I like my yearly spending to stay under $10K, but if I go over I'm not freaking out. I've been able to stay on budget with my personal spending for many, many years now, though! We'll see if the cleaner hurts my numbers, or if I can offset the car purchase as planned.

I think that covers where things are now.

**WHY DON'T I SPEND MORE?**

I started including this section because I was asked about it so much. Same as last update, so nothing new here.

I get asked this a lot. Why am I still trying to accumulate wealth 10 + years after I retired? Well, I'm still relatively young, and I have some big future goals that includes a large animal sanctuary with its own vet clinic and vegan restaurant. Even though I already have about 40 acres lined up for it, it is going to take a long time to get all the infrastructure in place. It might be 5 -10 years before it actually opens. I'm hoping to build as much as I can in the meantime.

I'm also just frugal by nature. Most of the stuff I enjoy is free or nearly free. Hiking trails, video games, TV, movies, diving down rabbit holes of whatever interest me at the time, etc. Some of my hobbies even make me money. I've managed to buy cars that appreciate. I happen to be a decent poker player. My watches have done really well...same with my art collection.

I don't live like a pauper. I live alone in a 4000 sq ft Mid Century house built into a cliff overlooking a river and beautiful valley with an indoor pool...so don't think my frugality always comes at the cost of the finer things. It is true until I recently bought my dream house I lived in a very modest house most people wouldn't associate with a millionaire (that house now rents for $750 a month), but I was patient and wanted to find the perfect house before I bothered to move. As I briefly mentioned before I have nice things like collector cars, art, watches, etc....I just try to spend as little as possible on depreciating assets or things like food. I appreciate good food, but being vegan makes it hard to eat out in my area. That is probably an understatement. There are maybe a handful of places I can eat at all (at least with more than salad as an option), and most of those only have one or two items on the menu I can eat. So I'd rather prepare great meals at home from cheap ingredients. I've gone into details in other posts about how I shop and prepare food, so won't make this post any longer doing it again.

As always, I'll try to answer any questions you might have. Thanks for reading such a long post!!",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-07-22,The end of the journey,"The end of the journey Teacher/42/married/1.8M NW

Why this post may be interesting to others is that I am a teacher and I did not get a windfall or extra help of any kind on my journey.

&#x200B;

**The Big Picture**

No one ever gave me money for education, car, home or anything else. I was born to a working/lower class single mom. I've worked since I was 14, never stopping even through all of my undergrad and graduate studies. I paid my way through college +some debt, paid for a master’s +some debt and just finished paying/completed a doctorate. All that was financed by myself or debt I paid off myself and I was able to reach my FI target at a *fairly* young age. I’m not blowing my own horn here as much as saying this for the people reading this who are coming from a similar place or similar income. **You can make it.** We often have FI stories from high earner or people who had a leg up and sometimes people wonder, yeah, but what if I don’t fit that description? I don’t fit that description. Here is my story.

As a teacher I never made more than 90k a year at my main job, most years much less. I know some of you are saying, 90k as a teacher? Yes, but I moved countries multiple times and to multiple schools with lots of sacrifice in between to get there. That 90k salary was literally deemed a “hardship post”, hence the extra pay, and that was only for a handful of years. I would guess my average over the years of my career was closer to 60k. I do have a spouse and that has helped in the long run, but at the start it was more of a financial drag than a help to be honest as sometimes they went through long periods of unemployment or sporadic employment. Currently they make 50k a year and they have never made more than that, perhaps a fair average would be closer to 30k a year over the duration of our journey since sometimes they didn't work at all but most years they were earning 30-35k.

We hit our FI target about a year ago but took a year just plugging away as usual before acting on it. We did that both to be sure we were hitting the number and not just barely getting there. Plus, we wanted that extra year to really think about and discuss what this meant for us and what our plan would be. Now, I am about to (semi) RE. My spouse is still deciding what they will do, full or partial retirement.

While my spouse has been a contributing factor to our success, I’ve been the main driver of the route to FI/RE so I’ll focus on my side of things.

&#x200B;

**The Journey**

So how did I get here? A big reason is that I’ve not lived in the US for more than 15 years now. I taught a few years in the US, then started teaching abroad. My salary the last 10 years or so was higher then it would be in the US otherwise *but not in net income.* Cost of living has helped and being outside of the US rat race meant that there was almost no social pressure to do x,y,z that everyone else was doing so I’ve been totally free to not give a damn about the new iphone (never had one) or upgrading my car (haven’t had one for 10 years) or taking fancy vacations (we have travelled to 49 countries and lived in 6, but almost never fancy travel, almost always frugal). That said, I do work with other international teachers who are perfectly happy to spend all their money on all those things and more. Being abroad doesn’t make you immune from affluenza, but it helps you make separation from it since you are already living in a kind of bubble.

When I was in my early 20’s I lived in the US and graduated with a BS in education. I taught for a few years and loved my job, but I only made something like 25k a year. I could barely keep up with expenses and college loan payments. A friend of mine from teacher college was teaching abroad and their experiences sounded good so I packed up and found a job overseas. It was awful. The kids were brats, the school admin cheated people, I wasn’t making much more than at home either, maybe less. It was really interesting though and certainly there were perks you couldn’t get at home. I met a lot of “lifer” international teachers and their tales encouraged me to keep at it. As time went on, I gleaned more and more about how to get to the best positions in the most desired countries and most desired schools.

The international teaching circuit can be very good to teachers, but it usually does take some hardship posts first to build up experience to get somewhere nice. That was the experience for me. I had some tough times in N. Africa, then E. Asia, then SE. Asia moving from roughly 30k a year to around 40k a year. When I was in E. Asia I met a guy that retired at 50 and then became a teacher. At the time I didn’t know a damn thing about finance or early retirement. He explained to me compound interest and how he retired early and I was hooked. I was 26 then with -30k in NW from student loans. I fell down the FI/RE rabbit hole and by the time I was 30yrs old I’d raised my NW to 100k in index funds, no debt. Remember though, cost of living is lower in those places so even though the salary was low I could sock it away with my spouse working too. We would live on my salary, save theirs plus any extra. I worked seasonal gigs doing examining, tutoring, or grant programs in the summers. I took just about every opportunity I could to make extra cash. I kept upping my education, got a masters, and more training knowing that better salaries and places were out there to be had. I worked a lot, like a LOT a lot. I kept my eye on what the best jobs required and what sacrifices I needed to get there. To be clear, there were years where my spouse wasn't working at all but having a partner is worth more than an additional income. We have always worked as a team. They have supported me and we have worked towards our goals together.

About ten years ago I landed a job at a “tier one” school in E. Asia. It isn’t official, but many in the international circuit give three tiers to schools based on salary, location, benefits, teaching loads, etc. My first three postings were tier two, or worse maybe. When I started the job at the tier one school in E. Asia I also started year round part time work online in addition to the seasonal work and other classes I was taking. I was working and studying a lot. Like, a LOT a lot. At that point I really started to pour it into the investment funds and over that period I also bought rental properties. I taught at that school for about five years then jumped to another tier one school in Europe for another 5 years or so. During the 5 years in Europe I continued to sock it away into index funds, some stocks, and buy rental property.

&#x200B;

**Reaching FI**

Mid 2021 we hit our number. In a way it is surreal even though we've been working towards this for a long time. I love my job and although I’m going to take a year or two to just kind of figure things out and take my pedal off the gas, I will probably go back to full time teaching at some point. Once you get to the right place it can be a really enjoyable profession.

Besides what is left on the mortgages for the rental properties, we have no debt. Currently our yearly spending is about 50k. I plan to up that a little bit and also have a cautious withdraw rate. We will both continue to work in some form as well, so we may not even have to withdraw for some time.

Quite honestly winding down is really hard for me to do since I’ve spent a decade or more really pushing myself to do more. For the past 10 years I’ve been working the 50+ hours of regular teaching plus the 10-15 hours a week of part time work, plus often also 10-15 hours a week of graduate classes. Weekends and holidays I’d fill with whatever other work I could find and the online gig which was all year. As my velocity slows down, I was a bit afraid of feeling like I had gaps in my life, but so far, they are quickly filling with other things that I enjoy. So, I’m figuring that out.

In the meantime, we’re moving to my spouse’s home country. I’ll take language classes in my spouse’s mother tongue, keep teaching part time online, and enjoy running and hiking in the local area. I’m not quite sure what my spouse will do yet, but in two years we’ll see where we’re at and make adjustments as needed.

I had some opportunities that I was able to take advantage of but only because I was working hard and focused on my FI/RE goal. I’m grateful for all I’ve learned from this community and I hope others can take some value from my story.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-06-08,Five Years into early retirement from retail pharmacy (final update),"Five Years into early retirement from retail pharmacy (final update) *FINANCES*: I’m going to phone it in again this year with the update. Check prior contributions to see more history if you don’t know what this is about. Spending “budget” was $71,016 (based on 2% of net worth at EOY 2021): a meaningless amount that I won’t come close to hitting. Our estimated net worth went from $1,333,772 to $3,674,059 in five years. The biggest contributors to that (in order) were real estate appreciation, VTSAX appreciation, $200k early inheritance, student loan forgiveness, and semi-passive income. Philanthropy has gone way up. My stack of donation requests (junk mail) was six inches tall after coming back from a month-long vacation.

*YEAR FIVE*: Life is returning to normal post-pandemic. Wife and I have started traveling again. In addition to a few local state parks, we made a quick return visit to New York City. Friend and I went to Los Angeles for a bit. And as I alluded, wife and I just got back from four weeks in Ireland and the UK yesterday (Northern Ireland was country #20 for us). Wife and I have been volunteering with the Cornell University nest watch and bird feeder watch programs. I got back into racing after swearing it off. I was able to pull off a new personal record of 2:42:26 in the 2022 Carmel Marathon (also winning the 40+ division), improving on the time I would have earned without a wrong turn in a 2019 race on a harder course that mentally forced me into quitting. I put in over 6000 miles of training in 18 months to be able to come back and do that. I’ve been decent at dedicating more time to hiking, picking up litter, reading, watching movies, visiting friends/family, and playing games.

*THE FUTURE*: I still want to do less internet. I still want to learn to swim and move over to triathlon. I want to volunteer more, listen to my multi-channel hi-res audio more, and get back heavier into classic cinema. I am determined to improve my weightlifting, which I have already restarted. Lots of traveling. Two weeks in Japan with a friend in August 2022. Three weeks in California with wife in October 2022. Two weeks in Hawaii with wife in January 2023. One week in Japan with a different friend in March 2023. Two weeks in Spain/Portugal with wife in June 2023. Three weeks in (you guessed it) Japan with wife in August 2023. Need to brush up on the Japanese now that I think about it. Finally going to watch Better Call Saul since Breaking Bad was so great. Excited about the JWST. I will return to volunteering more often. And yes, I will do whatever the fuck I want.

*IN CONCLUSION*: I realize that not everyone was able to grasp the fact that much of the humor and abrasiveness in these updates (and comments) was tongue-in-cheek. Let me leave you with a serious final thought though. Capitalism is a cruel mistress. A man who finds himself in a position to squirrel away $100k can invest that amount, do nothing but sit on the couch all day, and still pull in more money than a full-time employee making minimum wage at a soul crushing job. This country does not reward hard work. It rewards privilege, awareness, dedication, and financial discipline. I am so lucky.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-06-05,Two years post-FIRE - reflections on a new milestone reached today!,"Two years post-FIRE - reflections on a new milestone reached today! Today marks two years since I ticked off the last day on my countdown calendar and left my 23-year career behind. Most days, that phase of my life seems really far away, but on occasion it feels rather near. The former makes good sense to me as I feel like, despite the challenges that came with COVID-19, I’ve done a lot of things since embarking on this next chapter in my life. I originally wrote this as a blog post but reworked it (and removed links that could be deemed self-promotional) in the hopes that others on a FIRE path would appreciate my thoughts here. 

If you’ve worked in retail, manufacturing, or in a whole host of other trades, you understand the value of taking inventory. One of the key lessons I’ve learned since leaving the workplace is that this applies to our personal lives as well. What do I mean? I’ve found there is tremendous value in taking time to reflect, allocating the mental space needed to think about what you’ve been up to, your accomplishments, lessons learned, etc. I didn’t do a very good job of that - and often enough during my career, but deliberate reflecting and writing has been a big part of me changing that. And so I thought it would be a fun exercise to take inventory of those things here.

So what have I been up to? While not an exhaustive list, in no particular order, I have…

* **Started a YouTube channel and** **podcast** with my good friend of 35 years. As I write this, Eric and I have released 38 full-length Two Sides of FI episodes as well as many highlight videos, outtakes, and Shorts, which have been viewed nearly *one million* *times*, and we are approaching 15,000 subscribers to the channel. Wow! I recognize that's small potatoes compared to actual YouTube stars, but I’m so proud of this project and remain humbled that people value the content we produce. This has been the most fulfilling aspect of my FIRE journey so far, without exception.
* **Learned\* video and audio production and editing**. The asterisk denotes that this learning is *very* much ongoing. But I feel like I now know just enough to be dangerous re: Final Cut Pro, Garage Band, and the processes needed to put out video and audio content.
* **Completed three iOS app development courses and** **wrote a few apps**. I spent a good chunk of the first 4+ months after moving to this effort, and really enjoyed it. I completely threw myself into this and had planned to do so even before leaving my job. I’ve not done much with this lately but who knows? I may pick it up again.
* **Qualified as a FAA-certified Part 107 commercial drone pilot**. Last year I bought a drone and wasn’t entirely sure of where that would take me. But since the videos were going to be used on YouTube and I had some interest in other commercial uses, getting the license was the right path. Will it ever go beyond simple hobby use? Who knows?
* **Volunteered at my local COVID-19 vaccine clinic**. One of my post-FIRE aims was always to do more service. Due to COVID and other more selfish reasons, I haven’t done really well on this aim – yet. But I did enjoy taking a weekly shift at the town clinic during the big vaccination push in those early months after shots were available. This felt really good and isn't something I would have been able to do were I still employed full-time.
* ""**Worked"" one day a week at a local winery tasting room**. I never saw this coming but my love of wine, enjoyment of education, and need for socialization made a once-weekly tasting room ""job"" a great fit. I’m still doing this nearly a year later with a really great group of people, and I truly enjoy it – as well as the industry discounts! 
* **Given several talks and career counseling to students**. I had the honor to be invited to speak to two groups of undergraduate + graduate students about careers in biotechnology and my own path. Since then I’ve had a number of career counseling calls with students. I get a ton out of these and wonder if it may turn into something I want to do more with.
* **Took the** **longest vacation of my life** **– more than 5 weeks!** Like many, we didn’t get to see family and friends for over a year due to COVID-19. It was wonderful to get such a long time to travel with my wife and daughter, seeing so many people we missed. This kind of trip, along with some shorter road trips, simply couldn’t have happened were I still working full-time.
* **Found a great online community** via a FIRE Discord server. I’ve been a fan of online chat since the earliest days of the internet. But I didn’t realize the value I’d find in socializing with a group of like-minded FIRE folks such as this great group has provided me. Talking about FIRE can be tricky so forums like this, like Reddit, are a wonderful thing to have.
* **Taken several online classes**. Outside of the iOS coursework, I’ve taken classes in topics including financial markets, personal finance, world history (admittedly we’ve been a little delinquent on this last one lately). I love learning and look forward to taking some classes at our local community college or university in the future!
* **Started a homebrewing club with my wife**. Making connections with people and socializing is important. The combination of moving to a new town, not having a “day job”, and COVID made both things tough. It’s been great to combine our love of beer and brewing with the opportunity to meet people. We’re a few months in now and it’s going really great.
* **Done a ton of cooking and learned new cuisines**. I managed to make all seven of the traditional Oaxacan moles, which was an extension of a long-standing bucket list item to make mole negro. Eventually I moved on to Indian cuisine, which was a really fun change-up. I’m still cooking nearly all the family’s meals at this point and it’s something I truly enjoy.
* **Taken hundreds of walks and hikes**. I’ve taken a 3-mile walk nearly every day since I stopped working, and most weeks I also take a longer hike with my wife. Over the last month I took several >20-mile walks, including one that was marathon-length. This has been great for so many reasons: when solo, I listen to books or podcasts, or simply take quiet time to reflect. When my wife and I walk/hike together, it’s great phone-free time to just catch up, talk about future plans, and enjoy quiet time together. I can’t imagine not having this in my life now!
* **Read many more books than I had in years**. While I’ve always been a reader, admittedly the pace of completing books slowed a *lot* for me as my career advanced. I’ve now completely turned that around and between audiobooks, ebooks, and the paper kind, I get through tons more these days. It’s also wonderful having a library just a short walk from home!

I’m sure I neglected to add *many* things to this list. And it’s way too long so I do wonder who will even read it. But even so, it’s been truly rewarding to sit, think, and write this piece. A few thoughts come to mind: While I now have way more “free time” than ever in my adult life, I’ve never been bored (I get asked this a lot). Rather, like many early “retirees”, I don’t know if I’ve ever felt busier. The difference is that now with rare exception, the day is full of the things I/we want to do, and not things at someone else’s direction. But this list does at least help me appreciate why I always feel like I’ve got plenty that I want to do!

Looking at the list, it’s a mix of things I’d planned to do since before I stopped working, along with quite a few I just stumbled into – the YouTube channel is a great example of that. There was absolutely no plan to do that and yet it’s become my biggest time expenditure post-FIRE, as well as the most rewarding part of each week. And this is the benefit of this chapter of my life. I now have the freedom to wander around, trying things, and seeing what sticks. And like with iOS coding, I can simply set things down after trying them – temporarily or perhaps permanently. Who cares?

As I try to acknowledge in any content I put out into the world, I know just how fortunate I am to be where I find myself. I am from modest means, yet I had advantages that most in this world do not. I am thankful for all that I have. I wish you all the best in whatever you aim to achieve. Mahalo. 🙏",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-06-05,Truckin’ to Fi—3 year update,"Truckin’ to Fi—3 year update Almost four years ago I began truck driving across the country at the age of 24. I’m 28 now, with a net worth of roughly $275k. I had an initial goal of $250k to guarantee coast Fi with a projection of $2m by 58. 

A lot has changed since my last post and I still get a lot of messages from people wanting to learn how to replicate what I am doing and if it’s still possible. The answer to both questions is yes. I will briefly describe where I’m at now and my future plans. 

I no longer drive over-the-road (OTR). I’m a local driver and no longer homeless. After this next paycheck that is about to post, I would have earned $52,500 YTD. I’m averaging about $4,375 bi-weekly. I should easily clear about $110k or higher, plus a 8% 401k match. So total comp around $120k +/-.

My expenses are higher now then they were three years ago as I am paying rent, enjoying the fruits of my labor more and taking international vacations. But I still max out my 401k, IRA, HSA, ABLE accounts and save a little more in the brokerage. About $60k a year is what I want to save at a minimum. 

In 2 years, or about at the age of 30 I plan to partially retire. Let me explain, I hope to have about $500k at 30, which I won’t touch at least until 50. But I still have an urge to work a little because of all the years of compounding interest still ahead of me. Equally, the other half of me wants to enjoy his youth. So I will take one year off, work for one year, take another year off and repeat until the age of 40. 5 years of working, while taking 5 “gap” years or sabbaticals. Why? Because I want to max out my 401k, ABLE & IRA for every year between the ages of 30-40. I can make 100k a year easily. So if I work from July—July, I would have earned $50k every year for the next 10 years. $43k saved in tax advantaged accounts, after 10 years I should net around $600k+ with interest added in from these 5 years of working. So by 40, hopefully 1.6m total NW. 

During the “gap” years I will spend time with my family, travel long term internationally (slow round the world travel). I want to experience other cultures, learn new things, new languages and focus on my health. I’ve had a few surgeries the past year, nothing serious but I want to watch myself and focus and my general well-being. I’d plan on budgeting around $3,500 per month during each gap year. I receive disability compensation from the government from when I was in the military. I also have child support payments that has to be paid monthly, otherwise I’d be able to budget $5-6k during the gap years. I will also be homeless again in two years and carless, maybe just a storage unit and my phone will be my only other reoccurring expenses. My working 1 year intervals will be OTR (living in the truck) to minimize expenses. 

So robots are still not close to putting me out of work, as is always mentioned from people outside of trucking and won’t be for the long foreseeable future. The truck driver “shortage” is larger than ever. Really it’s a pay shortage, but anyway, it’s easier then ever to earn over $100k as a truck driver. It’s better to specialize; hazmat, refrigerated, tanker, oversized etc. almost anybody can get all the qualifications and be licensed to start working within 60 days. 

Also I’d urged anybody who has been diagnosed with a significant disability before the age of 26 to learn about the benefits of an ABLE account. It’s geared towards SSI recipients but anybody who meats the age and disability requirement can contribute to it. There is no income limit on it as they want to encourage any working person with a disability to use it. States run different types of accounts sort of like college 529 account. There’s different investment options and caps on the entire balance before you can’t make any further contributions. $16k can be contributed per year up to around $550k total balance cap (highest allowed state that I know of) after that interest can continue to grow. All withdraws are tax free but most only be used on yourself for your “basic” needs. 

I really do owe a large debt of gratitude to this community. I wouldn’t have known this was possible or how to do it without reading the endless threads and real life stories from people like you. I hope my post can inspire others like you all inspired me. Thank you. 

Also these are my plans as of today. It might change tomorrow. But I’ll try to give another update in 3 years. See ya all in 2025.

Woot woot. 

There are multiple tabs on the sheet: 

·  **Responses Cleaned:** The survey results after I removed incomplete responses and normalized currencies (edit: by normalized currencies, I mean I normalized the currency NAMES. The amounts are in their original currencies). Note that I only removed responses as incomplete when they were nearly all blank. 

·  **Clean Up Log:** My notes on the clean-up work I did. 

·  **Responses – All RAW:** The raw data as delivered by the survey software. Currencies are not normalized and includes incomplete responses. 

·  **Summary Report – All:** Summary that the survey software automatically kicks out (this is what folks were seeing after taking the survey).

2022-04-05,Found a great analogy for low cost index funds,"Found a great analogy for low cost index funds So had a very interesting phone call from my Aunt tonight. She had fallen into a windfall from a home sale and was told my by father that I am the one in the family to call about figuring out what to do with the money (not credentialed at all, just an avid PF/FI reader/investor). 

What she wanted to do with it- she had heard (From her grandson!) that TSLA was only going up and that she should put the whole thing into that. I told her why I thought this was a bad idea and that the better was a low cost index fund of something like the S+P500 and then tried explaining what a low cost index fund was. Turns out, this is a hard thing to explain to someone who has no context of financial literacy. 

So I came up with the following analogy. Imagine you are at a casino and each individual table is a stock. Some nights TSLA, AKA the roulette table does amazing, and some nights a couple players get hot and the table ends up losing a bunch of money. Overall, it is very volatile and will swing by more than most individuals can stomach. Instead, I like to invest in the whole casino AKA a low cost index fund. That way I am getting the gains of all of the tables. Some nights the Roulette table will get crushed, but is made up for by the fish over at the craps table. In the long run the casino, just like the low cost S+P500 index fund comes out ahead. 

She told me that it all makes total sense and that this is what she wants to do with her money. I am going to help her set up with a Vanguard account mostly invested in VOO/VSTAX in the morning. 

Cheers to all of you, who like the tech nerd in the family (my brother), gets calls about the families financial solutions.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-03-24,My Personal Pay-Off-Mortgage vs. Invest The $s Experiment: Final(ish) Results,"My Personal Pay-Off-Mortgage vs. Invest The $s Experiment: Final(ish) Results Hi everyone, u/FullyCommittedMaybe here. Long-time-no-post. Speaking of which, I hope this meets the criteria for its own post! I've been collecting data for just over 3 years, and I finally reached a big milestone, so I figured I would spend a minute longer than usual and share real-life (albeit anecdotal) results of my mortgage vs. investment experiment. Up front, I do want to acknowledge that I have been *very fortunate* in many ways, and of course that your milage may vary.

**Background:** in January 2019, I set the goal to pay off (or have enough money to pay off) my mortgage by 1/2025 (as you might have already guessed...I beat the timeline by more than 2.5 years). I moved into the house 4/2016, so the original target would have been quite early relative to your typical 30 (or even 15) year plan, but I wanted to be aggressive. I was 31 when I set the goal, and I owed $130.5K at 2.875%.

At that time, there were regular comments (maybe there still are?) in the daily discussions with folks asking which was better -- pay off the mortgage early? Or keep the mortgage and invest surplus income in an attempt to outpace the mortgage interest rate? My gut told me to pay off the mortgage...I'd have plenty of money to invest once the payment was gone, I'd be 100% debt free, and I'd sleep better at night knowing I owned the house. But I just couldn't pull the trigger knowing that I had a great income, my interest rate is mega-mega-low, I am (sort of) young, and I can easily take on (what I would consider to be) a relatively low risk. I chose to invest the money, and I'm so glad I did. As of this month, I have enough to pay off the mortgage. So, how did the investments do vs. had I paid down the principal and saved the interest?

**Results:** 

*Scenario 1:* If I had made payments as usual (no side-investments, no extra mortgage payments), I would have paid:

* $130.5K principal
* $24.7K interest
* **$155.2K total**

*Scenario 2:* If I had used what I'm calling my surplus income ($88.8K over 39 months) to pay down the principal early (and made the payments on the same dates that I made my investments), I would have paid:

* 130.5K principal
* $7.7K interest
* **$138.2K total ($17.0K better than Scenario 1)** 

*Scenario 3* (what I actually did): I made regular investments over the course of the last 39 months in VIGAX and VTSAX until the account was large enough to pay off my mortgage (after capital gains taxes). 

* $30.5K principal (regular mortgage payments)
* $10.9K interest (regular mortgage payments)
* $88.8K investment
* **Total ""paid"" by me**: $129.7K
* Total growth: $21.0K (which will generate roughly $3.2K in taxes)
* If I sell, pay taxes, and pay off the mortgage in full today, I will have $6.1K remaining
* **Total cost to me (since I have $6.1K remaining) = $123.6K ($31.7K better than Scenario 1, $14.7K better than Scenario 2)**

**Takeaways:**

1. Given the market is down YTD, this is perfect timing to conclude and reflect on the experiment. Many of my friends and family feel that there is too much uncertainty in the market to put a large chunk of extra cash into it. COVID, gas prices, attempted reversal of a presidential election, war, etc. Lots to be afraid of, and the news will always remind you of that. But the gains of the last few years (which were, admittedly, tremendous) overshadow my YTD results in a big way. I'm glad I did not miss out on all those gains!
2. My investment loss is -$12.5K YTD in this investment account. So even with all the uncertainty and the losses, I still came out way ahead in the long run. I know this is only a 39 month experiment, but it's a good reminder that my personal philosophy is to focus on long-term strategies.
3. The reason the title says ""Final-ish Results"" is because I am not cashing out. In scenarios 1 and 2, the payoff dates would not yet be here. The money still has time to grow (or shrink!) before I hit the payoff dates in those scenarios. My suspicion is that it grows and I'm even further ahead.
4. Obviously I am fortunate beyond belief in terms of the market, income, stimulus, etc. Just want to acknowledge that one more time.
5. Looking back, it seems silly that I ever considered *not* doing this. It is such a small risk relative to the potential reward, in my opinion.

What did I miss? Any questions? I do not have Reddit on my phone anymore so I will check in on this post later. Good luck out there, everyone!",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-02-22,Three Year Update: 40 y/o FIREd,"Three Year Update: 40 y/o FIREd February 22nd 2019 is the last day I worked so it's been 3 years now.

Last year's post is here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/lppel7/two_year_update_39_yo_fired/

**Expenses**

So unfortunately I've changed the way I spend money and it's not compatible with Mint anymore, so I don't have the full category breakdowns with charts / graphs I've had in the past, but I'll do my best.

**Taxes:**  $50,245. I paid $40,000 in quarterly Federal estimated taxes and $8000 in quarterly State estimated taxes, in addition to the $655 I owed for Federal and $1575 I owed for State last April.   (I realized a bunch of capital gains last year and had some significant interest income.)

**Home:** $3460.  $99 per month for HOA, $515 for the year for Insurance, and I've started investing my HELOC so I have about $185 per month in Interest from that, plus the $50 yearly HELOC maintenance fee.  $1520 in property taxes.

**Healthcare:** $4840.  Health Insurance was $327 last year and $345 starting this year with Dental going from $26 per month to $28 per month.  Got a Crown last year that cost me $565.

**Utilities:** $2450. Electric for the year $842 (just over $100 in the four A/C months, and $50 the rest of the year).  Gas for the year $456 (~$70 in the four winter months, $17 for the rest of the year)  Internet is still $73 per month ($876).  Phone bill is $275 for the year.

**Automotive:** $2175. I spent $1059 on gas last year and drove a total of 5200 miles.  Auto Insurance was $506 per six months, twice, so $1012.  $105 oil change.  No other maintanence, but I'll probably be getting my brakes done and need new tires this year, so that will be a hit.

**Entertainment:**  $657.   $13.77 for Amazon Prime, $7.99 for Disney+, $17.99 for Netflix, $9.99 for Spotify, and $5 for Clash of Clans.  The Prime, Netflix, and Spotify are all reimbursed (~$430 per year).  I also spent around $120 on other video games last year.

Debit Card: $12,592. Now the categorization problem.  I switched over to using a pre-paid debit card (5% cash back) but it does not have Mint integration, and I'm not going to categorize the 400+ lines by hand.  I did a quick run through and just threw a ""1"" next to lines that looked like food / dining / snacks, and a ""2"" against lines that looked like ""misc spending"" whether that be gifts, clothes, shoes, bidet, etc.  That $12,592 is the grand total I put on the debit card over the year with about $2600 of that total already categorized above (e.g. Prime/Netflix/Spotify, Internet, and some other stuff is all on the Debit Card).

**Food:** My ""Food"" tally was $8590.  This more/less matches the $8000-$9000 in spending I've had the past two years.

**Purchases:** $1408.  This included things like my $566 bidet, $80 shoes, a few hundred dollars in Christmas gifts, movie ticket purchases, my $115 concealed pistol license renewal, and other Amazon purchases.

**TOTAL**  Ignoring the Taxes section, my total expenses add to $23,580.  This pretty much jibes with my expenses from last year ($28,000, but I had several big ""one-timers"" last year like the $2000 roof assessment and $3500 TV I bought).

---------------------

**Investments:**

I'll just add to the Table I posted last year.

Type|Retirement Day|1 Year|2 Years|3 Years
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
*Traditional IRA*|$299,000|$348,000|$380,170|$410,285
*Roth IRA*|$14,500|$18,150|$70,236|$75,800
*Brokerage*|$18,400|$22,900|$37,108|$179,110
**Total Vanguard (3 Above)**|$331,800|$389,100|$487,515|$665,195
Other Holdings, Crypto/Bitcoin|$145,000|$291,000|$1,315,000|$985,000
HSA Investment|$6000|$7400|$8760|$9453
Cash|$20,000|$9000|$135,000|$9345

Crypto is down a little bit from where it was 1 year ago, but that still puts me at around $1,670,000 in financial accounts.   During the bull run last year for Bitcoin I sold off a bit and moved the money into my brokerage account, which is why I'm going to have a $40,000+ tax bill this year.

I also started getting into the DeFi, Crypto Lending / Interest Earning systems.  I ended up having interest income of ~$52,000 last year, which is pretty nice given my expenses are in the $25,000 range.  And that was just for the partial year, I'm expecting closer to $80,000+ this year.  

It's a bit risky and out of many peoples comfort zones, but I'd been working out okay for me so far.

**The Living Part**

Is this pandemic thing still going on?  Has it been another whole year already.   

I'm still not going out a whole bunch, but it's certainly not as locked down as before.  My D&D buddy and his wife had another kid last year and the pregnancy was pretty rough (just constantly tired / nauseous.)  So D&D was on hold but I was still going over and playing other games.  Going hard on Gloomhaven, and lately we've been playing Terraforming Mars which was surprisingly good.  Now that the kid is born and Mom's feeling better, last week we had a quick 30-minute ""Session 0"" to re-establish where we are in the world, do some in-town tasks (buy new horses since a Troll ate ours...) and what we want to do going forward.  I just got a text today inviting me over for D&D this weekend, so yay!

Home life is same old.  I'm kind of on a 6-8 hour sleeping cycle many days.  Get up in the morning, drink some water, hang out listening to a podcast or watching a video, then going back to sleep for a few hours.  Lots of periodic napping.

Two of my cousins are planning on a cruise getaway in the fall which I might go on.  I've never been on a cruise but I want to, and this might be a good chance.  My one cousin (36F) has been cruising solo for the past couple years, and now it's her and her brother (34M) who are arranging this thing in the fall.  This might be a good opportunity to reconnect.  The Cousins have never really been close: we all get along and are excited to see each other, but it was really only a twice a year 4th of July and Christmas situation, which totally evaporated the past two years for obvious reasons.

**Moving House**

One last topic, I guess.  I'm considering moving house soon.  I've been in this 800 sq ft condo for 12 years now and I'm thinking about moving to 1) upgrade and 2) be closer to my circle of friends.  [Rough Map](https://i.imgur.com/6PqU5Ky.png)  ""B"" is the D&D friend and one I hang out with the most but is 30 miles away.

As we all get older I can only assume we'll be hanging out together more and more often, especially once these guys start retiring too.  I want to move into a bigger (and nicer) place that is more centrally located to my inner circle of 4 close friends.

There are some really nice areas over there and I'm looking at places that are currently in the $350,000 to $450,000 range.  Things keep coming up for sale and I have my eye on a few neighborhoods, but I'm just not ready to pull the trigger just yet.  I'm not **really** in any rush, there's nothing pushing me other than a mere desire.  So I can wait.  Wait out the pandemic, wait out the... whatever it is the market is doing right now.  Wait for the next Crypto bull run later this year or next year.  But I'll keep looking at Zillow and refining what exactly I'm looking for.  Maybe one will pop up that I just cannot refuse.

2022-02-17,Review of Projectifi for financial modeling and forecasting,"Review of Projectifi for financial modeling and forecasting Real quick in advance: I don't build, work for, etc. [Projectifi](https://projectifi.io/). It's just a new tool I've been using and absolutely loving. I have joined the early access and beta testing group, though.

I use [YNAB](https://youneedabudget.com/) for budgeting, and if you're not familiar with it, it focuses on ""giving every dollar a job"" and only on the money you currently have. There's no forecasting.

I had PersonalCapital but I found it to be of limited utility. It was more for entertainment purposes for me--it was nice to see the net worth forecast charts and the AA, but I often found it to be inaccurate. I also don't love free tools where I become the product (in PC's case, for them to sell my data and/or use it to try and sell me services). I also also realized that it only assumes around a 3% return even with the most aggressive projection settings, and I think they make it overly pessimistic (again) to try and sell services.

Over the last ~4 years that I've been learning about and pursuing FIRE, I've had a lot of big questions. To me, there's a somewhat scary aspect to retirement planning, which is that I have to figure out and start doing the right things 20+ years in advance, and if I don't, then life is going to be harder. I have to be careful with what I do today so that we have a better future.

This makes me worry about every big purchase or plan. Can I afford this home improvement? What if we have to buy a new vehicle? When you combine that worry with threads like ""[Can I afford this large one-off purchase](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/nufs4d/can_i_afford_this_large_oneoff_purchase/)"" by /u/monodactyl, I kept looking at those charts and thinking, ""I can't buy anything until we retire...""

[Projectifi](https://projectifi.io/) has you plug in all of your information: accounts, income, assets, expenses, cash-flow priorities, anticipated returns, etc. etc. It takes a ton of input, and that can be a bit overwhelming at first. But once you have it set up, you can create multiple ""plans"" and do all kinds of what-if scenarios.

I've posted some big questions to Reddit in the past and the responses are all over the place. Spend money now, save more, invest more, build an emergency fund, invest your emergency fund, etc. etc. With Projectifi, I can just plug these things into my plan, or copy my plan to change it, and see exactly what will happen.

Here are some questions that Projectifi has answered for me in the last month that I've been using it:

* What will the impact be on my retirement date and net worth if I save up 1 year's worth of expenses in cash now?
* Can I afford to buy cars for my kids before they go to college?
* Let's say I want to switch jobs... how much of a pay cut can I take and maintain our current standard of living and retirement date? If my pay goes down further, what else do I need to cut?
* [What if the real return for the rest of our lives is only 1.5%?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sl6wtv/the_goal_of_investing_is_to_achieve_a_real/) What changes, if any, do I need to make?
*  What happens if I stop investing now and put everything into cash? (lols)
* Can we actually afford to travel internationally as frequently as I want and still hit our retirement date?
* Should I take social security as early as possible or wait? What impact does that decision have on our net worth?

There have been a couple of surprising things it helped me figure out, too. The first was that I should stop putting money into my wife's traditional IRA. I had lost sight that we were now over the tax credit limit for tIRAs, so I was confused that it started showing that cash-flow priority as ""abandoned"" until I dug in a bit more. I'm also planning to start an HSA this year for the first time ever and wasn't quite sure how to fit that into our budget. Easy, demonstrated Projectifi: decrease 401k contribution, then increase that back to max over the next few years. Impact on net worth is negligible, even with the occasional health expense pulling from the HSA, so don't worry about it.

It also handles money in both ""today"" and ""actual"" terms to account for inflation. For some reason, when I put a long-term goal into YNAB (say, I want to save up for something over the next 10 years), it never occurred to me that it'll cost more 10 years from now than it does today. And I've studied FV and PV and know all the formulas, but I just wasn't managing my budget that way. ProjectiFi is helping me budget and plan more wisely.

The amount of peace that Projectifi has given me is enormous. There are so many financial questions that I used to wrestle with for days or weeks, thinking and second-guessing and searching around for other people's opinions. Now, I have a tool where I can model any question quickly and easily and know exactly what to expect.

Of course, nothing is guaranteed in life. I know that a simulation/forecast won't exactly match real life. But I think it's better than the echo chamber of my head and better than what I was finding in threads and blogs. I can model multiple scenarios for each question, decide what I'm comfortable with, and move forward. I'm sleeping better at night and I'm far, FAR more confident that we will successfully hit our financial and retirement goals.

So I want to share this with as many people as possible because it's just so good. You can use a free sandbox at https://projectifi.io/ to play around with it. I did that for about 3 weeks off and on before I decided to start paying for an account. A paid account lets it save your data, which is a tremendous time saver. I don't know how many times I had set up [the FIRE calculator on engaging-data](https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/) in the past as I tried to model out some new idea or challenge. Now, I just login to ProjectiFi and add or change whatever I need.

I deleted my PersonalCapital account. I like that ProjectiFi doesn't connect to my accounts and doesn't sell or advertise based on my data.

Give it a try. Even just using it for free and keeping it open in a tab for a long time, I think you'll find value in it. I'm over the moon, and I've been talking about it at my wife enough that she's started telling her friends and they've started pointing their partners to me. In terms of positive impact to my life (in the category of online/computer tools and applications), it ranks right up there with email and YNAB.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-01-30,"I have reached a savings rate of 86%+ , have I gone too far?","I have reached a savings rate of 86%+ , have I gone too far? Young doc in Switzerland in my mid twenties. Saving/investing the equivalent of 5,500€ of my post-tax income every single month.  

My monthly expenses are 300€ on rent (2/3 paid by my employer) , ~250€ on basic swiss health insurances, spending 150€ on food (never eat out, enjoy cooking) , 0 to 50€ in transportation (no car, small walkable swiss town) , 0 to 100€ in leisure/social life (more on the introverted side). No water, heating or electricity bills, paid by my employer/the hospital since I basically live on site.
 
So from 700 to 850€  in expenses. 

Meaning a savings rate of 86 to 88%.

2022-01-25,My case study. 50-70% savings rate while only working a little over half of the year and traveling a lot.,"My case study. 50-70% savings rate while only working a little over half of the year and traveling a lot. Hey everyone! I've never had such a high savings rate before, I've never made as much money as I currenly do and I've never been able to take off such large amounts of time from work to do things I love (like travel). I'm just so stoked. I understand that not everyone can be in a position like I am (I also know some people are in ""better""positions). However, I don't have anyone to share this with. None of my friends or family care and my GF just thinks I'm a dweeb whenever I even mention finances.

A little about me...

I'm 34 years old and spent most of my life this far living pay check to pay check.

I prioritize traveling and free time away from work and usually take 3-6 months off a year. Even doing this, I've still been able to max out my 401(k), Roth IRA, and HSA, but not much else. Due to my sporadic income and long periods of not working, I have to do a fair amount of financial planning to reach my goals. Every January I sit down for what seems like days on end and plan out my budget and finances for the entire year and due to my highly variable monthly expenses, income, and living arrangments, it's not a quick task. Every month I sit down and add up all my spending, log it, compare it to my budget to make sure I'm on track and adjust accordingly. Every week I go through all my credit cards and bank accounts and make sure there is not anything fishy going on.

**My Full Time (But Only Half The Time) Job.**

I'm a travel nurse. I work 3 month long contracts so every 3 months my pay changes and it can change dramatically. I'm currently making $5,400 pre-tax a week (I've made as ""low"" as $2,300/week). If you had told that 24 year old me as I was contimplating dropping out of nursing school that I would be making six figures a year while only working half the year all on a community college associate degree education, I would have laughed. I mean, at that time I was working 3 minimum wage jobs to get myself through nursing school. I was so exhausted that one morning on my way home from a long night shift at the nursing home, where I worked as a nurses aid wiping butts and changing adult diapers, I fell asleep driving. That alone would have been bad enough, but I ended up hitting a cop (I will be forever grateful that it wasn't a pedestrian or child). It was there, as I sat on the side of the road during a cold, wet Washington morning that I contimplated quitting nursing school. I hated it. I hated death, I hated shit, puke, infected ulcers, flaky skin, I hated everything about nursing. But I ended up not quitting nursing school, although I did quit one of my 3 jobs and scaled back the other two. This is when I really made finances more of a focus. I had effectivly cut my income by 1/2 but I still had to pay for school and my apartment. I had to budget hard, but I never had money issues. I could always cover expenses and have a little fun but I never really saved. Even when I finally became a nurse and only made $1,400 after taxes every two weeks, I was living paycheck to paycheck. It wasn't until I started travel nursing that I really got into this financial independence movement.

**My Lifestyle**

The nature of my job forces me to move around a lot, which I love. I'm currently living in South Dakota (I go where the money is). Come May, I will go live in Colorado and work for a while before heading off to Spain for a month, followed by Vietnam for 2 months and then back home to Washington State to see family and friends and spend what's left of the holidays.

Since I move around a lot, sometimes I stay in luxury hotels, other times I sleep in my campervan. I've stayed at an AirBnB for the last 3 months. I've slept in people's back yards, long-term-stay-motels, and even in empty beds at the hospital that I'm working at. When I travel abroad I'm often staying at hostels and last year I literally slept in a tent for 6 months while walking across the country. Nothing about my lifestyle is ""stable"" and ""predictable,"" which makes planning my finances a difficult task.

However, this year I'm making the most I've ever made and saving the most I've ever saved, while still taking a planned 5 months off (3 months abroad).

TOTAL 2022 END NET WORTH: **$360,490**

&#x200B;

**PLANS MOVING FORWARD**

I don't really know. I'm still quite awestruck that I will be making and saving this much. My numbers might be off, but I honestly think I overestimated my expenses and underestimated my income. For example, if I decide to extend my current contract at my current rate I would make $24,000 more than I budgeted. However, even if my numbers are off and I end up spending more than I planned (or make less) I have a pretty significant cushion.

**Buying a Home**

I'm at a point in my life where I want to start testing the waters. I don't want to be a nurse for my entire life. I'm sure I'll want to settle down eventually. So this year I'm looking for a multi-family property that I can use as my home address for tax reasons (it relates to my tax free stipend I recieve as a travel nurse). I will hopefully be able to rent out the other unit(s) to cover my mortgage while I continue traveling. Since this will be my first home and it will be owner occupied (at least on paper if not literally... again... I travel a lot) I should be able to qualify for a FHA loan with 3.5% down. I'm looking at around $300k-400k price range, which is what they are going for in South Dakota. Down payment will be \~$15k leaving me another $15k for repairs, renovations, and wiggle room.

**Growing a Side Hustle**

I have a website that gets me some passive income. I know that if I just spent a little time and effort on it, it would grow. I could hire some writers and maybe a social media expert and I think I could grow the website to a $1,000-$2,000/mo income stream. It currently gets me around $300-400/month with no effort on my part and I only started it a year ago. Perhaps I'll put some money towards this and perhaps I'll look into something else.

**Goals**

I don't really have goals financially. Sometimes I flirt with the idea of ""retiring by a certain age"" or ""having a net worth of $1million."" But honestly, these things don't mean anything to me. All I want, is to be financially independent; to not have to work to live... and I already kind of have that. I work when I want, take off time when I want, and make a really good living doing it. However, like I said, I don't really like my job other than the freedom (and money) it provides me. Nursing has really sucked my passion and empathy dry, especially these last few years. So, ideally, I just want to get out of nursing but still live the lifestyle that travel nursing has allowed me. There are some non-bedside nursing jobs that I might look into. There are even some remote work nursing jobs and although they pay significantly less than what I make now, they would allow me the freedom and time to pursue other ventures.

Really though, and this might sound silly or stupid, I just want a job where I can wear a suit and tie and hand out my business card like I'm in American Psycho. Maybe it's because I've never had a job where I get to dress up or maybe I'm just weird. I don't know. If you made it this far maybe you're the weird one, but thank you and Cheers!",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-01-21,It is extremely hard to be an investor and a doomer.,"It is extremely hard to be an investor and a doomer. There are two forces that are battling each other inside me every single day. 

I know that the prime directive to achieve FIRE is to VTI and chill. There are so many studies that show that even during wars, economic collapses or bubble bursts the overall stock market in a long period of time was always going up. But can we be sure about it? 

 I help out climate researchers in my spare time (as a volunteer ) for a couple of years now and sorry to say but the future looks blant and tragic. Every study, article or every friend tells me that we are in a worldwide decline that will hit us like a truck in just a couple of years. I even helped prepare some data models for the future regarding water use, energy needs and society response. After years of trying to convince people, I'm now too numb to tell you that it is too late. You can't have an unlimited system that goes upward all the time on a limited resource that is our planet. This is not something that can be prevented because it is already happening and we can only maintain the organism alive but not heal it completely. This is not a war that can be stopped, this is not a society problem that can be changed by a government or a new law. This is a life-altering mass collapse of everything coming our way and people don't care. 

And here I am, waking up every day and thinking about how I need to invest more of my money because inflation is eating it up. And every day, when drinking my tea, I look at the latest ecological publications and I wonder if the society will collapse in 2030 or maybe 2035?

I know it is harsh but I feel like you need to be a hopeless optimist to believe in FIRE. You need to believe that everything will be all right, that the world will be good and prospering, and that technology (not developed yet) will save us. I can't.

Preventively I will tell you that I invest most of my money into Green-tech and green solutions whatever that means. And it doesn't work great may I say it? Global clean energy ETF is -25% since a year, Solaredge -27%, First solar -17%, Sunrun -58%, Enphase -23%. If even green tech stocks are down how can we believe in saving our way of life? 

And no, this post was not made because I'm red on the last couple of days. I'm -20% in a year now and I don't really care anymore. This post was made because for the last 10 years I see the writing on the wall but everyone is telling me I'm the doomer, the crazy one and VTI and chill. It makes me sad",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-01-07,11 Years post FIRE yearly update,"11 Years post FIRE yearly update  

This was cross posted in [r/leanfire](https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/) a couple of days ago and r/Fire today, so if you have already seen it there, nothing is different.

I always begin these yearly updates with the same disclaimer that I don't have a specific FIRE date since I was self employed before retirement and slowly dissolved my business over time and started investing in real estate. I use the 2010 time frame for reference because it is around the time I hired a property manager (thus leaving me zero active work to do unless I choose), but it certainly isn't exact.

This isn't meant as a comparison to anyone else. This is strictly provided to the FIRE community because I know I would have liked to have seen real world example of how people handle their finances when I was trying to figure all this out many years ago. Another reason I post these is to show there is more than one way to do FIRE. I was able to accomplish this without ever making a high income during my working years. I simply lived very frugally and put the money I saved into individual stocks (hey, it was 80s - 90s...I didn't know better and stock investing was a completely different animal back then) and then converted that to buying rental properties in a low cost of living area in the 2000s.

Quick stats: I'm 56, single, no kid's, about 11 years post FIRE.

**INCOME**

Total net income for the year.

$124,040 (this does not count reinvested dividends)

If you think they should be counted, my total in dividends is

$10,089

**GROWTH AND NET WORTH**

My growth in my investments so far

High Dividend Stock account began the year at $98,892. I invest $100 per day into it. It currently is at $169,774.19

Broad Market Index fund account began the year at $193,640. I invest $200 per day into it. It currently is at $394,610.11

My Fundrise account started the year at $44,479. I invested a total of $16,000 so far this year. It is currently at $78,778

My real estate (rentals) is very difficult to estimate since I have partners on some of the houses and some I own outright. Not to mention it isn't a liquid asset. I usually just judge it by the income it produces...that being said it does have a value that adds to my net worth. I'll be conservative and say my real estate portfolio is worth $1.5M - $2M, although the amount I've personally invested into it is well under $500k.

My personal property (the house and 10 acres of land I live on) is worth about $450k - $500k...again as a conservative estimate. A house similar to mine, but in my opinion not quite as appealing, recently sold for over $750,000.

I have misc. accounts totaling around $25K...this is a small Acorn account, and my liquid accounts that I use for personal and business expenses. I keep more in a ""cash"" bank account than most because I need to cover business expenses. I try to keep around $20K in there, but it will fluctuate greatly throughout the month to as low as $7 or 8K, to sometimes as high as $30k. I currently have another $4k in a money market fund. I have this for quick liquidity when needed. This also varies greatly and will be as high as $50K at times.

Not going to bother with my cars and other misc. on this update. This brings my total net worth as of this update to around $2,618,162 (using the conservative estimates above)- $3,000,000

**EXPENSES**

I spent a total of $8,531 on all non business related expenses. This came in slightly under my goal of $800 per month, or $10K per year even though I did have an ""expensive"" car repair in the first half of the year.

Phone/Internet $25 (Visible wireless with unlimited hotspot for internet)

Insurance on my cars $45 (3 cars liability only)

Food/groceries $100 (I've done some detailed food budget breakdowns if you're curious how I keep this so low)

Electric $125 - $150 (average throughout the year/ all electric house)

I have my own well and septic tank, so no bills for water, sewerage, and trash.

Gas for cars $50 - $100. I spent a little more time driving in the last few months of the year, so my gas budget went up quite a bit. This is mainly due to semi local trips for hiking/and or entertainment. (everything within 100 miles, but it does add up)

Entertainment $100. I hate to give this it's own line in the budget, but I do sometimes spend on entertainment, so although this is no way a true reflection of what I spent last year, I am including it because everyone asks, lol. Most of my entertainment ends up being ""free"" or nearly free other than the gas it takes to go places.

Health Insurance is a free (for now) catastrophic plan. Thanks to all my real estate deductions I get to write off most of my income, leaving me just able to qualify for the absolute worst plan available in my state for free. Of course, if one little thing goes wrong at tax time and I step over the threshold at the end of the year, that could change and I'll be left paying for a plan I've never used.

That brings me to $470 - $555, that give me plenty for any one time expenses that come up. Some months are under, so months are over, but my average even after the car repair this year was $711. I like my yearly spending to stay under $10K, but if I go over I'm not freaking out. I've been able to stay on budget with my personal spending for many, many years now, though!

I know it is controversial, but since my house is appreciating faster than my actual investment into it, my house falls under the investment and not expense category in my accounting just in case you noticed no house payment was listed as an expense.

I think that covers where things are now.

**WHY DON'T I SPEND MORE?**

I get asked this a lot. Why am I still trying to accumulate wealth 10 + years after I retired? Well, I'm still relatively young, and I have some big future goals that includes a large animal sanctuary with its own vet clinic and vegan restaurant. Even though I already have about 40 acres lined up for it, it is going to take a long time to get all the infrastructure in place. It might be 5 -10 years before it actually opens. I'm hoping to build as much as I can in the meantime.

I'm also just frugal by nature. Most of the stuff I enjoy is free or nearly free. Hiking trails, video games, TV, movies, diving down rabbit holes of whatever interest me at the time, etc. Some of my hobbies even make me money. I've managed to buy cars that appreciate. I happen to be a decent poker player. My watches have done really well...same with my art collection.

I don't live like a pauper. I live alone in a 4000 sq ft Mid Century house built into a cliff overlooking a river and beautiful valley with an indoor pool...so don't think my frugality always comes at the cost of the finer things. It is true until I recently bought my dream house I lived in a very modest house most people wouldn't associate with a millionaire (that house now rents for $750 a month), but I was patient and wanted to find the perfect house before I bothered to move. As I briefly mentioned before I have nice things like collector cars, art, watches, etc....I just try to spend as little as possible on depreciating assets or things like food. I appreciate good food, but being vegan makes it hard to eat out in my area. That is probably an understatement. There are maybe a handful of places I can eat at all (at least with more than salad as an option), and most of those only have one or two items on the menu I can eat. So I'd rather prepare great meals at home from cheap ingredients. I've gone into details in other posts about how I shop and prepare food, so won't make this post any longer doing it again.

As always, I'll try to answer any questions you might have. Thanks for reading such a long post!!",0.0,Neutral,English

Trying to do one of these every year/at milestones. This is the second one. At the beginning of my last semester of undergrad in 2012 I signed up for Mint, and I’ve kept it pretty up to date ever since. This was way, way before I started getting educated about personal finance and decided to take some career gambles, so the Mint graphs show all of that pretty clearly.

GENERAL NOTES
* After around March 2019 the chart starts to reflect household income (added spouse’s assets/debts after the wedding).
* The huge random spike in December 2017 is just a glitch from when my student loan accounts got booted off Mint for a few weeks, so it wasn’t subtracting my giant student loan balance (discussed below).
* I am a transactional lawyer in biglaw. Spouse is an MBA student who will start full time at a FAANG company in 2022.
* After waffling on it for a few years I decided to NOT aggressively pay off our student loans. Between my spouse and I, we currently have ~$270k outstanding and will add ~$20k more over the next few months as we round out the MBA. Instead I created what I call a student loan collateral account, which is a taxable investment account where I’ve basically matched dollar-for-dollar our approximate student loan balance of for a total of $300k (exclusive of unrealized gains). Once COVID forbearance rolls off, I’ll maybe refi most of the debt down to a ~3% interest rate (currently it’s something like ~7% at the federal rates) then make minimum payments on a 10 year plan. Assuming 7% market returns, I’ll net 4% each year. And if shit hits the fan, spouse and I get canned, and I can’t otherwise service the debt, I can always incrementally sell down the collateral account to make the payments (even at a loss if things are really bad). I think the risk of that happening is pretty low, though, and in any case outweighed by the upside of leveraging that money into the market for a decade. I think mathematically it’s the most advantageous approach. Plus there’s a (vanishingly small) chance some or all of it gets forgiven.
* I don’t go too crazy with budgets or anything. We’ve got a nicer apartment, like to eat at restaurants and like to travel (the last one obviously making less of a dent this year and last), but otherwise live pretty simply without trying too hard. I think we’re well north of a 60% savings rate.

HISTORY
* Pre-2012. Grew up in the middle of nowhere. Solidly working class. Parents didn’t go to college. Mom didn’t work. Dad had a trade job. Basically zero personal finance/career guidance from family. I wasn’t going to go to college but a mom of one of my high school friends talked me into throwing in some applications. Ended up at a community college while working full time at various fast food places. Got an AA. Decided to keep going for a BA and got into one of the big state schools. Majored in a social science because I thought it was interesting, but didn’t really have any plans for what I was doing. At some point I googled what kind of job you could get with a social science degree and it said you could be a lawyer. I thought, lol no way they’d let me be a lawyer. Turned out they would. Started reading a law school forum and gunning to get into a top school.
* 2012. Graduated with BA and worked for a year for local government. Made about ~$20k/year.
* 2013. Got into a T14 law school. Decided to roll the dice and go despite the insane cost ($270k all in) because I didn’t really see any other opportunities. Was definitely a gamble since ~50% of people who go to even top law schools don’t end up making enough to be able to service that kind of debt load.
* 2014. Living off student loans in law school. Got a summer gig after first year at a small firm that paid $20 an hour. Most I’d ever made.
* 2015. Still living off loans, but this is where the gamble started to pay off. Got a summer associate job at a biglaw firm that pays on the NYC comp scale. I got super lucky—I only got 1 offer. Could just as easily have been 0. Made like $10k for working that summer, which was the most I’d ever made (basically made 50% of my peak annual income in one summer). Most luckily of all, I got a full time return offer.
* 2016. Graduated law school. Passed the bar. Racked up some heavy credit card debt since I wasn’t getting student loans any more but had to cover COL for several months. Started full time at the firm. Salary $180k/year (but just for the back end of the year, so really just like $30k in 2016).
* 2017. Still at firm. Salary still $180k+$15k bonus. Paid off credit card debt and about $50k in student loans (this was before I settled on the strategy noted above). Threw about $5k into crypto.
* 2018. Still at firm. Salary $200k+$32.5k bonus. Discovered the personal finance sub. Maxed all tax advantaged accounts for the first time. Got married.
* 2019. Still at firm. My salary $220k+$50k bonus. Spouse’s salary $60k. Discovered FIRE. Started piling cash into SPY/VTI/VXUS. Added spouse’s assets to calculations (+$140k NW). 
* 2020. Still at firm. My salary $255k+$92.5k bonus. Spouse’s salary $60k. Got spouse on board with FIRE. Spouse started a part time MBA at a top 25 school to try to boost household income in a couple years. COVID student loan forbearance kicked in so I was able to invest that money instead of making minimum payments.
* 2021. Still at firm. My salary $305k+$160k. Spouse quit job to do an MBA internship, so between the partial year of pay at the old job and the summer pay at the internship probably made around $50k. COVID student loan forbearance was in effect all year, so we were able to put a bunch of money into the market. Plowed about $10k into crypto.
* 2022. Planning to stay at the same firm, but looking at in-house positions since we’ll have to move for spouse’s post-MBA job. My salary will probably average out to around $300k if I jump in-house, higher if I stay longer. Spouse will start a $200k post-MBA job part way through the year.

NW BREAKDOWN
* $25k cash/emergency fund
* $980k equity index funds
* $50k crypto
* $0 real property
*  ($278k) student loans/monthly CC balance

2020 NW: $396k

2021 NW: $784k


FIRE TARGETS
* $2mm NW. This is where I’ll feel comfortable that we have a safety net to be able to take some career risks. This used to be my FI target.
* $5mm NW. This is my new FI target.
*  $10mm NW. this is where I’ll consider RE (used to be $5mm).

2022-01-01,"FIRE calculators that do different and interesting things, YEAR 2!","FIRE calculators that do different and interesting things, YEAR 2! Jan 1, and I have updated my spreadsheet!

I check my spreadsheet twice a year, and a guilty pleasure for me is to take my numbers and spend a couple of hours running them through different FIRE calculators to see how I'm doing. I am visual guy, not a numbers guy, so they really help me understand things in a way that my spreadsheet does not.

The calcs below all have slightly different approaches, but here's a list of ones I like and why.  Please feel free to suggest any calcs you don't see there. Thanks!

I posted this list back in July of 2020, but now seems like a good time to update it because there are new calculators coming out all the time.

This is the one I use the most, that I compare all the others to. I don't like how the inputs are on different pages, but I like the graphic output, which is easy to understand.

[https://firecalc.com/](https://firecalc.com/)

This one is interesting because it includes actuarial information about death rates. So, yeah, I have a 3% chance of running out of money at age 85, but I have a 30% chance of being dead, so 3% doesn't look that bad in comparison.

[https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/](https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/)

I like this one because it allows you to set a goal for how much you want left over. Some of the calcs will show you 100% success if you end up with 1 dollar at age 100. This one lets you set how how much nest egg you want left over for your kids. (Or your cats. Let's be honest.)

[https://www.nesteggly.com/fire-retirement-calculator](https://www.nesteggly.com/fire-retirement-calculator)

This one shows your nest egg in terms of how many days per year of freedom it will buy you. So if you have 500,000k saved and plan on spending 75k a year, your nest egg will pay for 97 days of freedom per year in retirement. That's kinda cool.

[https://engaging-data.com/freedom-calculator/](https://engaging-data.com/freedom-calculator/)

This one lets you show the effects of various rates of inflation which I don't see in other calcs. I just don't like the graphic it produces as well as the other calcs. [http://www.cfiresim.com/](http://www.cfiresim.com/) EDIT: Updated link from limpingrobot

[https://alistair-marshall.github.io/cFIREsim-open/](https://alistair-marshall.github.io/cFIREsim-open/)

This one differentiates between standard, tax deferred and Roth accounts to help you plan your withdrawals better.

[https://www.i-orp.com/Inflate/index.html](https://www.i-orp.com/Inflate/index.html)

This one it has sliders for some of the inputs which are fiddly, and you need to specify different income streams at the bottom. On the plus side, it has room for spouse income and is very clear and interesting graphically.

From Joy090, once similar to Networthify

[chodthewacko](https://www.reddit.com/user/chodthewacko/) suggests this one. It separates tax deferred/tax free/. It needs to be downloaded or run through Java to work.

[jrjjr](https://www.reddit.com/user/jrjjr/) (Creator of nesteggly) also suggests FICalc. It has different withdrawal strategies, and lets you export or share your results. For historical data, it shows which start years would have succeeded or failed for your portfolio.

[https://calculator.ficalc.app/](https://calculator.ficalc.app/)

cranescult suggests this calc, which has a place for sequence of return risk which no other calc I've seen has.

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/financial-goals)

This one allows for interesting back testing of other withdrawal strategies than the 4% model.

Project FI was suggested by [**RedditF1shBlueF1sh**](https://www.reddit.com/user/RedditF1shBlueF1sh/)

[projectionlab.com](http://projectionlab.com/)

I like it! They have a free sandbox, or a pay version. You have to pay to be able to save your data, 48 bucks a year.  It is very fine grained about sources of income, with starting and stopping dates, which I like. I have a side gig I will continue when I RE, and I will probably stop when Soc Sec income comes on line. ProjectFI handles that income nicely.

2022-04-18,Solicitation for Comments/Questions re: the emerging “web3”/”Metaverse” value chain,"Solicitation for Comments/Questions re: the emerging “web3”/”Metaverse” value chain  **tl;dr** — I’ve been researching these two related themes while trying to construct conceptual frameworks towards a more rigorous industry/competitive analysis of the space (with a focus on value chain analysis), much along the same lines as my [previous industry analysis on the hyperscale cloud oligopoly](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/t60u7v/planetaryscale_computation_an_industry_primer_on/) that I posted in this subreddit last month. Regarding “web3” and “The Metaverse”, the relatively uninformed participants (people on social media, many of the journalists covering the space, etc.) communicate more noise than signal while the more informed participants are \[understandably\] biased towards talking their own book when facing the public. Therefore I am hoping that those interested in less biased, more rigorous thinking around this emerging “megatrend” might share some of their questions, musings, criticisms, comments, apprehensions, etc. regarding all things web3 and Metaverse here (or through my dm’s if preferred) so that we can consider some independent perspectives for framework and thesis construction around this space. As thanks, I’ll do my best in providing point-by-point responses (whether by comment reply or through dm’s) to all questions/comments written in good faith.

### Longer Version

It is entirely possible that the web3/metaverse vision fails to materialize in the near term in any meaningful way for any number of reasons, be they dramatic (e.g., faster than anticipated advances in quantum computing threaten encryption schemes that aren’t post-quantum encrypted, geopolitical tensions leading to dramatically lower semi supply, left-tail risk from nuclear war, and other strings of words that might have sounded ridiculous two years ago) or entirely mundane (e.g., people just get bored of the entire idea and move on). On the other hand, it is entirely possible that this digital megatrend *does* materialize in a meaningful way in the near term future — it is this latter case that I am concerned with fleshing out in a more rigorous manner.

I would argue that the various \[publicly accessible\] thematic reports that research desks have recently initiated and publicly disseminated regarding all things “web3” and “metaverse” ...

... are probably not as rigorous and comprehensive as the research desks might like to be because:

1. They’re still concerned with offering somewhat *balanced* perspectives around these themes and convincing their clients to invest in the theme.
2. They haven’t yet had time to assess bleeding edge projects and opportunities in the space because of their limited bandwidth and because they don’t yet (and arguably might never) constitute “equities” (i.e., on the sell-side you don’t get a bonus for pitching a potentially consequential pre-seed Crypto Start-up XYZ to your MD because the team can’t officially add non-equities to the official coverage list nor can the brokerage desk help in buying/selling the name).

When I say the existing thematics are not “rigorous” what I mean is that their purpose is primarily to communicate vision and therefore do not dive into the boring details that matter for a proper competitive analysis of the space. For example, a lot of the current talk about whether or not Facebook’s proposed 47.5% \[25% of the remaining 70% after platform fees, undoubtedly initially presented as 47.5% to highlight 30% iOS/Android platform fees and induce an anchoring effect\] cut of digital items on their platform is “fair” when the more salient question (for investors, at least) is whether this proposed 47.5% (or even 25%) cut would be achievable or sustainable given Facebook’s competitive position along the value chain. Many people think Apple’s 30% take rate is *unfair* but this is besides the point as it has been undeniably *sustainable* thus far, given the iPhone’s integral position within the mobile value chain — a similar, detached analysis of Facebook’s competitive position requires a deeper look.

[A strong set of industry-wide open standards in AR\/VR serves to modularize the value chain. Developers can therefore more easily create experiences and apps that are platform-agnostic without having to be wedded to individual platforms\/devices.  ](https://preview.redd.it/0ps36r725bu81.png?width=3352&format=png&auto=webp&s=676ea3d8a252e9704d11be142b1d52ab47e56ee7)

The Khronos Group is the primary standards setting body for AR/VR industry and they help in the creation, development, and management of industry-critical (or “Metaverse-critical”) standards and file formats such as glTF, OpenXR, etc. An understanding of the role of Khronos and the ongoing inter-company coordination efforts in open sourcing these standards would eventually lead you to the conclusion that Facebook can not be a price setter (i.e., take rate setter) for the industry in the way that Apple was and is for mobile.

Yet if you ctrl+f through any of the thematic reports you will find 0 mentions of “Khronos” or “OpenXR”, etc. While all of these thematic reports recognize the importance of standards and interoperability for the web3 and the Metaverse, not a single one of them have a single mention of the AR/VR/XR industry’s dominant consortium for “*developing, publishing and maintaining royalty-free interoperability standards for 3D graphics, virtual reality, augmented reality, parallel computation, vision acceleration and machine learning*” (*Wikipedia*: [The Khronos Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khronos_Group)), let alone the actual standards themselves and what the implications of having open standards will be for the value chain of “The Metaverse.”

This is what I mean when I say the primers/thematics are not rigorous enough. Once again, this is not because the research desks are unaware of these details but that their focus at this point is convincing many of their clients that the theme is even investable in the first place. Too much detail upfront might muddy the narrative.

One subnarrative circulating around this still-amorphous idea of the Metaverse is that, however this thing takes shape, the computing requirements of it will be of an unprecedented scale — most everybody is in agreement about this. Where these subnarratives go too far, however, are when proclamations like “[Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse will require computing tech no one knows how to build](https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/metaverse-zuckerberg-computing-infrastructure)” (from *Protocol*) are made without taking into consideration certain *boring* details like how Amazon is already using their existing “computing tech” (i.e., AWS) to power their MMO, New Worlds, using distributed scale out architectures across EC2 instances \[*I write about this in my Cloud Computing primer* [*here*](https://www.notion.so/Mass-and-the-Law-of-Economic-Gravitation-9e0a3896fe0d4fcd86670b284292fbb7)\]. Or how we already know about the kind of computing currently done at Facebook (e.g., DNN-based recommender systems, transformer-based object detection, etc.), the rough breakdown of what workloads occupy Facebook datacenters, and roughly what the trajectory of both the software and hardware of this \*already functional “\*computing tech” is headed towards. The author of the *Protocol* article points to [Intel commentary](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/powering-metaverse.html) on how an immersive Metaverse “will require even more: a 1,000-times increase in computational efficiency from today’s state of the art” but doesn’t go further. The article can hardly be said to be rigorous or detailed enough to back its primary claim that “no one knows how to build” metaverse computing tech — many clues exist for people who choose to dig into the boring details \[*my full rebuttal of the Protocol article can be found* [*here*](https://www.notion.so/Mass-and-the-Law-of-Economic-Gravitation-9e0a3896fe0d4fcd86670b284292fbb7) *within the Cloud Primer*\].

Another subnarrative circulating in the web3 and Metaverse discourse is around how this nascent ecosystem is empowering creators, giving them the necessary tools, distribution, and monetization vectors in order for creators to create more value and capture more economics than was previously possible before in web2. This subnarrative is, in fact, one of the cornerstone propositions of the intersection of web3 and the “Passion/Ownership/Creator Economy” and much anecdata perpetuates this subnarrative, from Substack successes to seemingly overnight NFT hits. But, if it is indeed true that things like creator tools, content publishing platforms, distribution, smart contract creation, etc. lower the barrier to entry for being a creator, what mediates the sustainability of the creator economy? In other words, if *everyone* is a creator, how can *everyone* also have “[1,000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)”? This problem is further compounded by the accelerated improvement of AI/ML models that can produce multi-media content such as GPT-3, Codex, DALL-E, etc. (text, code, and images, respectively) as well as tools from Facebook and Nvidia (among others, no doubt) that make scene and object creation in VR environments easier and easier \[Ben Thompson recently called this “[Zero Marginal Content](https://stratechery.com/2022/dall-e-the-metaverse-and-zero-marginal-content/)”\]. Where, therefore, can the sustainable competitive moat for the average creator be found? Will the economies *really* end up going to creators writ large, or will the economics continue to go disproportionately to the top 1% of all creators in a Power law fashion?

Identifying where value accrual, potential for differential returns, and profit pool formation/sustainability might emerge in this space requires taking a stuctural, value chain perspective. Several overarching themes and questions in this emerging industry currently seem to me to be the most informative in thinking about the direction and implications of this space’s evolution:

* **The Open Metaverse** | What is the “Open Metaverse”? What is required to bring forth that vision? How path dependent is this vision? Is an “Open Metaverse” likely?
* **Web2’s Disruption** | Which traditional tech (aka “web2” lol) companies and verticals does web3 seek to disrupt? Which web2 companies are more susceptible to being disrupted and which ones are likely to be able to adapt? If [web2’s take rate is *really* web3’s opportunity](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645842552086532?lang=en) as Chris Dixon claims, which take rates are to be impacted, to what degree, and for what reason?
* **Value Chains** | How should we think about the value chain for the converging web3 x Metaverse ecosystem? What subordinate value chains are embedded in this overarching web3/Metaverse value chain? Are there any potential points of integration along the value chain that can’t ultimately be modularized?
* **Competitive Moats** | If the cryptopians seek to decentralize and effectively commoditize nearly every stage along web3’s value chain, media creation eventually becomes a ZMC activity because of low/no-cide and AI/ML, the dominant “Metaverse” standards and formats are open, and all of the code is open source and forkable, then are there any sustainable moats in the industry? Where will the industry’s economics and value accrue — does the value simply just manifest as consumer surplus? Will the inherently fiercer competitive tactics of this space (the “last aggregator” problem, vampire attacks, etc.) rapidly compete down the industry’s cost of capital? Does the [fat protocol](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) thesis still hold? How can [aggregation theory](https://stratechery.com/concept/aggregation-theory/) be applied to web3?
* **The Creator’s Trilemma** | How can it possible for a Creator Economy in web3 to simultaneously have low barriers to entry (ML-assisted content creation, commoditization of tools through entire media value chain, zero marginal cost distribution) AND be economically sustainable for creators as well as the materials-based (i.e., “real”, not in the Metaverse) economy writ large AND not exhibit massive Power law inequalities in attention/earning distribution? What would a resolution of this trilemma this look like?

And, in no particular order, some \[underdeveloped\] lower-level questions/themes/points and threads that can be weaved into the aforementioned overarching narratives:

* What are the monetization routes for the BAYC franchise? How much of their current valuation and success hinge on achieving mass adoption? What happens if the brand never becomes widely popular, despite attempts to inject it into mainstream culture through movies, celebrity partnerships, etc.?
* How would a vampire attack on existing web2 social networks (e.g., *George Hotz*: [Twitter](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2022/04/16/vampire-attack-twitter.html)) work? Do DeSo (decentralized social media) protocols hold structural advantages relative to existing platforms?
* In what ways can NFTs have “utility” beyond ostentation?  
   * financialization: using NFTs as collateral for borrowing against, “staking” them for yield
   * access: web3 having inventory/wallet-dependent views in which the user’s view of any website/app/game can be modulated depending on ownership of different tokens (e.g., using tools like Unlock Protocol and [Livepeer](https://youtu.be/9cynlI61YE8?t=1114) to enforce and manage token-gated streams, obviating the need for traditional sign-on for media platforms).
* [Decentralized frontends](https://blog.sia.tech/announcing-homescreen-decentralized-frontends-for-web3-113a3564530d) and personalized yet private (in-browser, not cloud based) ML recommender models (see: [PrivateAI demo](https://youtu.be/GaWE33EJFBg?t=841)); online marketplaces for different recommender algorithms to choose between (i.e., imagine you were able to choose what your Twitter timeline algo was)
* How can a “Play-2-Earn” (P2E) economic model ever achieve long-term sustainability in a way that doesn’t simply become Work-2-Earn and resists automation from in-game AI agents (Altered State Machine one such “AI-NFT” project that promises to deliver AI agents into games — how can P2E games ever be work if AI agents can automate the game task to earn the in-game currency?)
* Where does the chain of trust break down in web3? Aren’t you ultimately trusting your wallet interface (e.g., Metamask, Fantom, Rainbow) to parse transactions and requests accurately? How can a user ultimately verify that their cold wallet (e.g. Ledger) can be trusted and hasn’t been tampered with? In a world where web3 interfaces exist as VR overlays in the Metaverse, how can you know that in-game actions that call your wallet isn’t doing anything malicious, especially in an “Open Metaverse” that hosts all manner of user-generated programs?
* What opportunities exist for capitalizing on web2 → web3 ecosystem onramps?  
   * [OpenSea accepting credit card payments](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/140115/opensea-rolls-out-credit-card-payments-for-nfts) for NFTs allows them to earn a spread between what a user would have paid (i.e., fees for converting fiat to crypto, then fees from transferring crypto to MetaMask, then gas fees for the purpose) by bundling transactions together on their end.
* How long before [8K resolution](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/virtual-perfection-why-8k-resolution-per-eye-isnt-enough-for-perfect-vr/) per eye for VR is achieved? Would this advance in optics represent a meaningful competitive moat due to IP and/or manufacturing complexities?
* Will community and culture (and developers) turn out to be the only competitive moat in web3 once everything else along the value chain is modularized and commoditized?
* Decentralized compute/network/storage vs centralized hyperscale cloud infrastructure players  
   * Will the oligopolistic structure of hyperscale cloud lead the Big Three to eventually fight for becoming integration partners for decentralized compute/storage services? Which CSP will be most amenable to integrating IPFS and Skynet into their cloud ecosystem?
   * Are there advantages that distributed computing protocol like RNDR or Golem or Akash have over centralized CSPs? Can advantages from being distributed and decentralized overcome the scale advantages inherent in centralized hyperscale cloud?
* How can zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and differential privacy technologies be used to make VR eyetracking and biometric data collection palatable to privacy-wary consumers?
* How can privacy-preserving “data cooperatives” like Ocean Protocol maintain the privacy of their datasets while at the same time allowing algorithms to run functions on them? How much of a hidden dataset can be reconstructed through looking at the output?
* cc0, copyleft, VPL, GPL, and other IP-related minutiae. Trademarks vs copyrights. Transferability of IP during NFT sales.
* WASM.
* What can an “on-chain education” look like? How can cryptographic timestamping be used to build on-chain proof of competency for students in an increasingly digital world? What’s the role of games in helping students learn? Can the integration of educational value (via simulation games, physics-based simulation, designing in-game economies, programming contracts into various protocols) into games be one way to make P2E models sustainable?
* What will be the role of open source AI/ML models (Eleuther’s GPT-Neo, Salesforce’s CodeGen, etc.) in the web3/Metaverse value chain?
* Is it possible for an open source hardware ecosystem to emerge for VR hardware? Community fabs, HackerSpaces with 3D printing, recycled materials from old electronics, etc.
* DLSS, eye tracking resolution, edge server rendering.
* Games integrating backwards into the value chain after acquiring a consistent userbase (e.g., Axie Infinity integrating backwards by creating their own Ronin chain).
* GSMA 5G telco standards for edge devices.
* Where do new nascent, internet-native modes of organizing labor and capital (investment DAOs, gaming guilds, streamer houses, token-gated communities, etc.) fit in the web3/metaverse value chain?
* [Hyperstructures](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html).
* Liquid democracy, digital democracy, quadratic voting/funding, etc.

In summary, I think fleshing out a more rigorous, detail-oriented framework will add to understanding how this space might actually evolve more than simply by following every new project or narrative that comes out of this emerging ecosystem (especially given that a new project/protocol/fork/sidechain/game seems to come out every day). If you’re thinking along the same lines and feel like sharing your questions, musings, criticisms, comments, apprehensions about this emerging ecosystem I’d love to trade notes.",0.0,Neutral,English

2022-03-03,Planetary-Scale Computation: An industry primer on the hyperscale CSP oligopoly (AWS/Azure/GCP),"Planetary-Scale Computation: An industry primer on the hyperscale CSP oligopoly (AWS/Azure/GCP) I wrote a multipart primer on the public cloud infrastructure industry and the relation of the industry's three-member oligopoly to the broader cloud ecosystem (ex-China).

Although I recommend the Notion view, both are available.*\]

This primer's main section, ""*Three-Body: Competitive Dynamics in the Hyperscale Oligopoly*"", is the section of most relevance from a business/industry analysis perspective. This section is extensive so I've made a partial outline of this section for convenience (i.e., what I think might be of most interest to analysts):

* ***Initial Positions and Laws of \[Competitive\] Motion*** addresses ...
   * current strategic positioning of the Big Three; the effect of COVID on positioning
   * an attempt at explaining the triopolistic (as opposed to fragmented or monopolistic) industry structure of cloud infrastructure \[i.e., ""Why *three* hyperscalers?""\]
   * on the applicability of Christensen's modularity theory towards the cloud computing industry; how an analysis of cloud computing is a natural extension of Christensen's work on the computing industry in *The Innovator's Solution*
* ***Mass and the Law of \[Economic\] Gravitation*** addresses ...
   * global public SaaS revenue run rates at 2-3x that of public IaaS+PaaS; napkin math on how aggregate enterprise value of cloud software companies is roughly 2.7x that of hyperscalers'
   * framing evolution of IaaS industry margin as a function of evolution of compute demand and of compute supply/capacity
   * framing compute demand as primarily a function of computation per capita (CPC) & claiming that the subdrivers of CPC will be based on
      * use-case agnostic overhead from privacy-oriented cryptography and AI/ML workloads
      * key use cases in the form of personal finance, personal health (incl. genomics, biometrics), and ""Metaverse"" workloads
   * a look into Facebook's existing workloads & my hypothesis on why they partnered with AWS
   * deep dive on *already existing* (i.e., not hypothetical) computational realities of ""Metaverse"" workloads from recent AWS re:Invent keynotes and breakout sessions regarding their new MMO, *New World*, and a simulation case study from AWS; highlighting current AWS thinking around ""the Metaverse"" as explicated in recent interviews \[*interviews that few people are paying attention to as evidenced by viewcounts*\]
   * a look at CapEx and server/equipment depreciation
* ***Velocity and the n-body problem*** addresses ...
   * parameterizing the X *eating* Y narrative (i.e., Software eating world, Cloud eating software, Multi-cloud eating cloud, etc.) as X modularizing and commoditizing Y to reintegrate into X's interdependent value prop
   * a value chain breakdown/mapping for the public cloud industry through a modularity/interdependence perspective; my personal views on the Cloud ecosystem
   * a summary of the a16z ""cost of cloud"" debate; why the ISV/hyperscaler frenemy dynamic & the move towards multi-cloud has acted as a motivator for continued vertical integration by hyperscaler CSPs
   * on hyperscaler vertical integration, both backwards and forwards; on what ""industry cloud"" is and how integrated hardware/software for AI/ML ""solutions"" might act as a point value chain reintegration for hyperscalers

An exhaustive point-by-point breakdown of the entire primer can be found in [this Figma map](https://www.figma.com/file/inQyEHVgPyjNYKKu7VifdT/directory-for-cloud-primer?node-id=0%3A1) for people who want to skim/explore the primer's claims without committing to reading it.

This primer's focus is competitive dynamics *first* and financial analysis *second* **—** financials and metrics are employed towards painting the competitive landscape and not the other way around. Beyond the general lack of primers for cloud infrastructure and hyperscaler IaaS, a large reason why I am publishing this primer is because I feel that the space is more interesting than what prevalent surface-level discussion might suggest \[*i.e., Every earnings season you'll find the exact same ""AWS/Azure/GCP grew X% on a Y billion base beating/missing expectations by Z%!"" takes as last quarter*\]. The highly modular nature of the cloud computing industry \[*i.e., Computing is the ultimate ""modular"" industry, which is probably why Christensen focused so heavily on the computing industry in articulating his modularity theory*\] and the oligopolistic structure makes it a perfect case study for both Christensen's modularity framework and Porter's frameworks around oligopolies which he develops in *Competitive Strategy* and an industry case study titled *Capacity Expansion in a Growing Oligopoly*.

My thesis is that a combination of these (and other) competitive frameworks can be employed to provide a unifying context for multiple distinct narratives about the Cloud, including but not limited to: ""commoditization"" of IaaS, [The Tech Monopolies Go Vertical](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/the-tech-monopolies-go-vertical?s=r), [how the cloud will be reshuffled](https://erikbern.com/2021/11/30/storm-in-the-stratosphere-how-the-cloud-will-be-reshuffled.html), [Trillion Dollar Paradox](https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/), ISVs vs Hyperscalers, hybrid/multi-cloud, the emergence of [Cloudflare's modular cloud](https://stratechery.com/2021/cloudflares-disruption/), etc. — this primer is an attempt to link all of these disparate threads together. I also try to answer overlooked or ""obvious"" questions like: Why *three* hyperscalers? Why *those* three? What prevents industry overcapacity? Why do CSPs even replace servers if they don't actually break down in 3-5 years? What keeps every company from simply switching over to Graviton if the price-performance is so good? Etc.

This is an ambitious project and I would not consider myself an expert, so feedback is welcome.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-01-23,Thoughts on CFVI & Rumble.com,"Thoughts on CFVI & Rumble.com Recently, the video hosting platform Rumble gave notice that it was merging through Cantor Fitzgerald's CF Acquisition Corp [*(NASDAQ: CFVI*](https://story.rumble.com/rumble-inc-the-neutral-video-platform-to-go-public-through-combination-with-cantor-fitzgeralds-cf-acquisition-corp-vi-nasdaq-cfvi/)*)* (a SPAC). 

The main value proposition appears to be an uncensored video platform. The Rumble platform appears to be targeting a few different markets. 

# Target Markets

* Video hosting - [Rumble.com](https://Rumble.com) 
* Subscription service for content creators - [Locals.com](https://Locals.com) ([Rumble merged with Locals](https://story.rumble.com/rumble-acquires-locals-to-help-build-a-bigger-creator-economy/)) 
* Web / Video hosting Infrastructure - Mentioned in multiple interviews, not launched

# Unique Value Proposition

* Pro-free speech and opposed to censorship, incorporating on those grounds
* Opposed to demonetization
* Data will be owned by the users (as opposed to say, YouTube), particularly for [Locals.com](https://Locals.com)
* Stated intent to provide infrastructure and tools

In multiple interviews the CEO has stated they intend to have the community & prominent 1st amendment attorney's build a Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. Locals already provides legal ownership of all data to the creators. 

# Investors & Future Collaborations 

They also appear to have gained some critical investors such as [Peter Thiel](https://nypost.com/2021/05/19/facebook-director-peter-thiel-invests-in-conservative-rival-rumble/). Recent news also indicated they'd [be supporting Donald Trumps new social network](https://thepostmillennial.com/trump-rumble-distribution-deal).

* 35 million views per month
* Est 525 million minutes watched per month

For comparison, see YouTube below...

**YouTube**

From various websites\[[1](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/youtube-statistics)\]\[[2](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/)\]:

* Claim: Est >1.8 trillion minutes watched per month
* Claimed 1B hrs viewed per day (60 minutes \* 30 days -> 1800B minutes / month)
* [**81%**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat2) of adults in the US use YouTube.
* In 2020, YouTube Premium hit[ **30 million**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat3) subscribers. ($11.99/month)
* YouTube had a[ **49%**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat7) growth rate in the first quarter of 2021.
* [**70%**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat9) of watch time on YouTube comes from smartphones and tablets.
* Globally, YouTube has around[ **2.24 billion**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat10) users.
* [**23%**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat13) of adults in the US regularly use YouTube as a news source.
* [**51%**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat15) of YouTube users visit the site daily.
* YouTube creators upload approximately[ **30,000 hours**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat17) of video per hour.
* The average YouTuber makes around[ **$18 per 1,000**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat21) views.
* The most viewed video on YouTube has more than[ **9 billion**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat25) views.
* YouTube ad revenue per view is between[ **$0.05 and $0.10**](https://serpwatch.io/blog/youtube-statistics/#stat27).

**Direct Comparison**

* YouTube appears to be worth / valued somewhere between $100 and $200B \[[3](https://looxcie.com/youtube-worth/)\]
* YouTube appears to have $360+m revenue / month from 30 million subscribers
* Rumble valuation appears to be $2.1B
* That places Rumble at about 1-2% the value of YouTube. 
* Rumble viewership is 0.02% of YouTube 
* [Locals.com](https://Locals.com) appears to have at least several million subscribers to communities. Unclear how much revenue is coming from this currently.

# Conclusions

It appears Rumble is targeting free-speech advocates, conservatives, gamers, comedians, conspiracy theorists, anti-vaccine groups, etc. YouTube appears to be targeting those same groups and purging them. 

At least 100 million Americans fall into those groups. As the election season heats up, I have a sneaking suspicion that Rumble may be one of the only places where those Americans can view content they want. This would further drive growth. 

YouTube appears to be worth / valued somewhere between $100 and $200B \[[3](https://looxcie.com/youtube-worth/)\]. That places Rumble at about 1% the value of YouTube. Rumble viewership is 0.02% of Youtube.

[Rumble is also suing Google for billions](https://financialpost.com/technology/rumble-sues-google) for altering search results. 

It seems like a decent opportunity, given: 

* Upcoming election cycle
* Trumps draw (he had tens of millions of twitter followers)
* Improved terms on Rumble (they are better than YouTube for creators)  
* Thiel's investment history 
* Locals seems to be growing and have a good revenue stream

2022-07-21,Amazon 20 to 1 Stock Split: What You Should Know,"Amazon 20 to 1 Stock Split: What You Should Know In a fearful economy where many stocks are undervalued due to massive selloffs, Amazon is achieving a noteworthy feat. They still wear the e-commerce crown and stand as one of four trillion-dollar U.S. companies but they are doing it while being grossly overvalued. One could think that Amazon is undervalued because, like other stocks, its share price has plummeted as investors panic over rising interest rates. 

However, Amazon is not a victim of a bad economy. Amazon is a victim of being a bad company. Their negative price movement, awful earnings performance, stiff competition, and unfavorable public perception all point toward a grim future. The positive price performance stemming from their 20 to 1 split only lasted a few weeks. No matter how affordable the stock appears it would be wise to steer clear of Amazon.

2022-01-13,Introducing Reklaim (OTCQB: MYIDF),"Introducing Reklaim (OTCQB: MYIDF)  **Company Overview**

Founded in 2018 and with offices in New York & Toronto, Reklaim is a company driven by the evolution of data and privacy. Reklaim aims to democratize data for consumers by providing them with an ecosystem where they can view, edit, opt-out, and be compensated for the use of their data. Today there is no destination for consumers to participate in the use of their data. **Reklaim aspires to be the destination that consumers visit to reclaim control of their online data.**

Available on the web and in both the iOS and Google Play stores, Reklaim allows consumers to opt-in to share specific pieces of data with brands, agencies, and companies in exchange for compensation from the use of their personal data.

All Reklaim data is 1st party, global, and privacy complaint (CCPA/GDPR).

# 

# Reklaim for Consumers

* Option to control the data they want and profit off the rest
* Passive income in the form of Device Rewards (Location, Profile, Shopping Rewards) paid into Reklaim accounts
* Active income from completing surveys and polls

# Reklaim for Companies

* CCPA compliant
* 1,000+ Fair-TradeTM Audience Segments
* Ubiquitous distribution to all major DSP's and DMP’s
* Link to Reklaim’s paywall to pay consumers for their data
* Create Fair-Trade data segments from opted in user base

# Value Proposition

Every adult on the planet over the age of +16 has a digital profile currently being sold for approximately $6k per year via a legitimized black market of human arbitrage. In this multi-trillion-dollar data market, there is zero consumer inclusion, transparency, or compensation. Corporations have gotten increasingly rich by taking advantage of consumers.

Privacy legislation is sweeping the world, placing the consumer at the center of new privacy policies that require explicit consumer inclusion, the opposite of what exists today. We are on the verge of a wave of massive data disruption where consumers will demand what’s rightfully theirs. COVID tracing, Tik Tok & China, Facebook vs. Apple - all front-page stories, all based on data and privacy.

Reklaim’s goal is to democratize data for consumers and place this transparency, control, and compensation in their hands. Reklaim aspires to become the defining consumer brand of data that is absent in the market today in the same way Uber redefined transportation, and Robinhood is attempting to democratize trading.

2022-01-11,Rivian (RIVN) - Summary of the Bull and Bear Case,"Rivian (RIVN) - Summary of the Bull and Bear Case In light of today's announcement by electric carmaker Rivian that their COO has resigned, I thought it might be useful to see a quick breakdown of the bull and bear case for the stock which I compiled yesterday:

**Bull Case:**

* **High Quality Product -** Rivian's R1T pickup has received rave reviews. Both Motor Trend magazine and Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) (15.2m Youtube subs) said it was the most ""impressive electric truck"" they've ever seen.
* **High Demand -** The company reported in their recent letter to shareholders that consumer pre-orders have increased from 55k to 71k units. Amazon is also a major investor and has pre-ordered 100k delivery vans. These vehicles will have deep software integrations with Amazon's AWS cloud service.
* **Aspirational Outdoor Brand -** The Rivian brand clearly appeals to an affluent demographic who have both concerns for the environment and a love for the outdoors. Google trends data also shows high search interest for Rivian and at one point was at similar levels to searches for rival incumbent, Tesla.
* **Vast Cash Reserves Raised -**
   * $13.7bn from recent IPO.
   * $5bn from the private markets.
   * 1.2bn in convertible notes.
   * Total: almost $20bn!

**Bear Case:**

* **Vehicle Manufacturing Complexity** \- the automobile business is notoriously capital intensive and the manufacturing process is not kind to new car startups. In fact no car startup has survived in the US in the last 100 years (apart from Tesla).
* **Ambitious Product Development and Factory Plans -** Rivian wants to launch 3 different vehicle types at the same time. This is a gargantuan task. Tesla struggled and almost failed on numerous occasions just to deliver one. The company also wants to build and operate two major factories simultaneously. Capital expenditures are likely to skyrocket.
* **Unprecedented Negative Cash Flow -** at the current burn rate, most of the $20bn in cash will have run out in 3 years. Rivian's cash flow statement shows losses of $1.15bn in Q3 2021 alone.
* **Retail Investor Exuberance -** recent stock price movements indicate that retail investors may have rushed into the IPO too fast without understanding all the risks. The stock dropped by 10-20% on news that Amazon plans to buy electric vans from rival Stellantis. But this was mentioned as a risk in Rivian's S1 filing before going public.

2022-12-06,(Future tech idea) get all food nutrients without eating anything,"(Future tech idea) get all food nutrients without eating anything I think in the future there could be something you could attach to yourself that would eliminate the need to have to eat food to have enough nutrients to be healthy. Sort of how today in hositals there are 'IVs' (Intravenous lines) that are placed in a vein like in your arm that give someone nutrients through blood if they are unable to eat, 'or a gastrostomy tube' which delivers nutrients directly to your stomach.

I know some people wouldn't like the idea of not having to eat anything, because it tastes good however if I had the choice I would use this tech for sure instead of having to eat things, mostly for productivity reasons. Think about how much time is needed everyday to eat, let alone prepare the food to eat. 

Just googling 'how much of our lives do we spend eating' it says 'an average American spends 67 minutes per day eating and drinking beverages' which probably doesn't include actually making the food. 

This sort of thing could be adjustable so you might have an app on your phone that can adjust different types of nutrients like protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals to you or your doctor's liking. For example if you were trying to build muscle you could change the settings so that you were at a calorie surplus.

2022-12-04,Brain computer interface / Neuralink,"Brain computer interface / Neuralink Right now it seems, there's going to be 2 kinds of BMI's, the ones that go inside the skull (cranium) and is attached to the brain directly, with connectors thinner than hair. The other one is outside the skull and works with LED light thru the cranium. The inside cranium - version is installed by a robot. 

First BCI's would be used to control computers. Mobile devices belong to this category. But when one ponders the prospects of Neuralink and other devices of it's kind, many more ideas surface.

Like Android/Iphone Neuralink could have apps. It will have an API, programming interface. Which means third party companies are able to develop their own software for the BCI'S! There could be a new section in Gplay store, dedicated to this new wave hardware.

Interfaces like Neuralink have the ability to both read and write in the brain. The leader of the Neuralink project Shivon Zilis said, it's all just electric signals going back and forth, you just need to find the correct places to connect to. 

If one ponders this, there could be some really cool apps. This is just a list of ideas I have, hope other ppl can add to this... :

 meditation app, to empty the mind of thoughts. Most people have minds that race all the time, watching movies/series makes this worse, since that person never spends any time with his own mind. This app could suppress or fade away these distracting thoughts. One would be able to spend time without thoughts, so even the body could rest and get better, since too much thinking gets in the way of healing. 

 Messaging via thoughts. At first one would use computers for messaging, just like you use your phone now, but the phone would not have touch screen, the whole user interface would be controlled by thinking. Later the interface would move inside the cranium completely. Since we would have the ability to send visuals and sound directly to the brain! This is far in the future, but I think it's a realistic prospect.

 Work enviroment. All the computers would be Neuralink/BCI controlled. It would be a lot faster way to work. Even machines like aeroplanes, excavators, loaders and cranes could have this interface, with safety protocols implemented. This would create jobs that require the employee to have a brain machine interface installed in order to get hired.

 Games! Lol, imagine controlling your fav titles with your thoughts. Later, perhaps, directly in to your visual and audial cortex, just like in the Matrix.

 Spotify in the brain.

 Dating apps. You could allow the BMI software to scan your thoughts and thought patterns for a few weeks 24/7 and then enter your ""deep thought"" dating profile to an dating app. This way it would be possible literally to find your soulmate, no matter where he/she is located at, no country restrictions!

 The arousal app. If a person has ""hard time"" with getting things down there to act accordingly, this app could offer some assistance. It could work in various ways. Like stimulating the brain with certain kinds of thought patterns, even customised ones. This would lead to a revolution in the Pr0n industry. 

 Brand new language! People with these interfaces could develop a new way of communication, an internet language. It would be universal, no matter what country you are from. No more learning of complex age old languages, just one way of mind chatting via the thought speak. Or Thospe for short. 

 Mind matters app. It would make thought profiles, a bit like the dating app. But this could be used to profile convicted criminals, who have committed serious crimes or have a long history of criminal activity. The court could make a decision to send this criminal for a Mind Matters evaluation and profiling session. Remember, some of the interfaces attach outside the cranium. Detectives could use this kind of mind databases to predict and prevent criminal activity.

 Thought controlled drones for the Ukraine army! 

You could drive your car by thinking. This would require some training and getting used to. New cars that support BCI's natively are needed. New traffic laws are needed. Very complex thing to go thru, takes years!

 Think with your pet app. You could train yourself and your dog to think alike! You could ""hear"" your dogs thoughts in your mind. Give commands and tell him he's a good boy, great mind bonding. A new era of man's best friend. Not for guinea pigs! 

 Concetrated thoughts app. You can be working, driving, doing sports, home work or just walking in the woods. Concetrated thoughts brings your attention to what you are doing, it fades out other distracting thoughts that slow you down or make you less efficient. Getting this done correctly and in a way that advances your skills, can have a nice boosting effect on self esteem also!

 Adblock for the benefit of your precious brain by Raymond Hill. Save your gray cells from the poisons of the big G.

 Open source and Linux! The open source community could later on develop their own non-corporate dependant version. You can be 100% sure your thought data stays with you, until you choose to share some of it. 

If you have ideas for apps, please continue this list of the future. I have more detailed ideas and some other ones that I will preserve for the days to come!",0.0,Neutral,English

2022-10-24,A perspective on mixed reality and industry directions,"A perspective on mixed reality and industry directions In this post I'm going to show a perspective on the future of mixed reality that might help clarify what you're seeing in industry news. Specifically the perspective that mixed reality experiences are the mainstream goals and companies are simply keeping pace with one another until hardware is available. Most of these observations aren't new, but I think it's important to see a possible big picture. First some terminology so we're all on the same page.

* Virtual reality (VR) - A virtual world with no connection to the real world except for headset tracking and user inputs.
* Augmented/Mixed reality (AR/MR) - Augmenting reality with virtual elements like user interfaces and objects. While augmented and mixed reality are largely interchangeable, mixed reality is sometimes used to explicitly refer to blending of the virtual and real world. To do this, geometry in the real world is scanned allowing virtual objects to seamlessly exist in the real world and interact with it. Users can manipulate virtual items like they would real ones. Examples are like placing furniture in your house from a store to see how it would look before buying it.
* Pixels per degree (ppd) - The horizontal resolution divided by the horizontal field of view per eye.
* Foveated rendering - The eye has foveal vision at the center which is high quality and peripheral vision that's less high quality. Eye tracking can be used to ensure high quality rendering where the eye is looking and lower quality outside of foveal vision. The brain is none the wiser if this is done correctly and small artifacts are ignored. This can be exploited such that even though a display is massive in pixel density (say 16K per eye) the rendering cost is primarily at the center of vision, so only a fraction of the pixels are rendered at a high quality. (See DeepFovea which renders 10% of the pixels). This also lowers the bandwidth required when streaming content - assuming a low-latency connection. It also lowers the power usage by requiring less rendering.
* Inside-out tracking - The headset tracks itself using cameras on the device allowing it to track over a large or infinite area.
* Geometry reconstruction - Using inside-out tracking to 3D scan the world and place a tight fitting triangle mesh or point cloud over everything.
* Scene understanding - Identifying objects in the world. This can be simple from floors, ceilings, and walls to more advanced systems that attempt to identify everything.

**Companies**

Currently the following companies are iterating various technologies related to mixed reality. Some are a lot more public with their research, but all have various teams dedicated to the R&D.

Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Google, HP, HTC, Lenovo, Magic Leap, Meta, Microsoft, Panasonic, Philips, Pimax, Qualcomm (reference designs), Samsung, Sony, Ultraleap, Valve, and Varjo

Pimax and Valve might be the outliers currently for focusing on just VR without evidence of further visions. (Though Deckard is a standalone VR headset with inside-out tracking so Valve is definitely still iterating toward MR features). Sony might seem similar, but they have mentioned having goals beyond PlayStation.

So what do these companies picture happening and why is mixed reality a big deal?

**Monitor replacement**

A headset capable of over 60 ppd can begin to render virtual monitors that appear identical to physical ones. Think about how much you, your work, or others spend on computer monitors, phone displays, and TVs. Essentially most of the market for these can be taken by an adequate MR device. Any industry using a display can be disrupted by this. Game consoles like Nintendo Switch and handhelds like Steam Deck are good examples. As MR devices become mainstream casting to them becomes the standard such that having a separate display makes little sense. Imagine a future console that was built into an Xbox Elite controller and cast to your headset. Furthermore, older features like split screen on a console would instead cast to multiple independent MR devices. So when mainstream adoption spreads all the money that went to the TV manufacturers begins going to whoever sells the MR headsets. It's no surprise then that almost all TV manufacturers have R&D in this area not even specifically for the display hardware, but to control the headsets as well.

This might beg the question, what about people that don't have a headset and can't view a shared display? As with most technology the initial cost will be large, but as MR grows and eats into the marketshare of other displays the costs will drop. Simple cheap lightweight display glasses might exist for viewing monitors at a desk. It's also probably that cellphones can be used to view MR content during the transition period. If you don't like glasses, it's likely there will be [contact lenses available](https://www.roadtovr.com/mojo-vision-smart-contact-lens-ar-hands-on/) also. The hardware required for the glasses is so tiny that the jump to contacts isn't as large as it might seem, though it might have disadvantages.

**Extracting information from the world**

In order for virtual objects in a mixed reality environment to look seamless the real world must be analyzed (usually by machine learning techniques) and information extracted. The following information would be extracted:

* Light sources and properties: Their location, color, temperature, intensity, and the shape of the light.
* Material properties: From a rendering perspective this involves calculating metallic and smoothness values for the surfaces.
* Reflections and transparency: Identifying mirrors and shiny and transparent objects can prove challenging. A number of papers have tackled this to some degree.

The computation required for this is expensive. Various companies above have solved pieces of this; however, nearly all solutions are held back by computing currently. The hardware required for high quality results will happen, but not for a while unless it's offloaded to a powerful desktop or more specialized and expensive chips. What this means is while many basic applications are feasible some advanced mainstream applications that customers might want are simply not possible right now.

**Basic Applications**

Wikipedia has a list of [possible applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality#Possible_applications) ranging from simple to advanced.

One application is overlaying information on the world and buildings. Looking at an intersection and seeing clearly defined street names. Another common example is overlaid directions on the ground when walking someplace or in a store when searching for items. [Google has been able to do this for a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogfYd705cRs&t=5128s), but holding a phone up has never quite been elegant. Google is very aware of this.

**Collaborative seamless working**

Casting oneself virtually to another person's environment would offer a nearly identical experience of being there. Even a physical whiteboard or document could be instantly shared by looking at it by either party. With eye, face, and pose tracking realistic avatars can offer seamless presence. Companies (especially Microsoft and Meta) have long envisioned and prototyped these kind of seamless social interactions at work and home. Their hardware however has fallen short of mainstream expectations, but it is clear they have a direction they're going for.

**Extreme data collection**

In some configurations a headset can always be recording and collecting data. This means it can scan the world and store a persistent memory of everything that can be recalled. When combined with machine learning this allows for retrieval of information. ""Where are my car keys?"" ""You placed them on the sofa yesterday. Their last known location has been marked for you."" Historical queries have been possible with services like Google Timeline for a while to discover somewhere you visited a year ago but forgot the name of. MR allows such queries, but at a much finer detail depending on the data that's stored. It should be noted that video isn't required for this. A temporal knowledge graph that simply remembers descriptions, times, and locations of events can be sufficient for creating compact histories that can be searched.

**Interfaces everywhere inside**

In addition to replacing larger displays, the displays on various Internet of Things (IoT) devices can offload their interfaces to an MR device. Home and office automation software would handle the permissions and security as normal like when accessing from a mobile device. The difference being that instead of using a phone or tablet you'd simply look at a device like blinds or a light and activate the item.

**Interfaces everywhere outside**

A standardized Bluetooth Beacon can offer MR interfaces for various devices when in range. Walking up to an elevator for instance could display elevator buttons and a wayfinding system. In a secured building using the interface's elevator controls could unlock floors identically to how hotel cards do in some buildings. These Beacons can also be used at restaurants to transmit menus without QR codes.

In the further future stores could display all prices using virtual price tags.

**Gaming experiences**

In general the idea of overlapping a fantasy world over our own captures many of these experiences. With edge cloud computing utilizing 5G and machine learning the idea of creating a world over our own procedurally is realistic. This includes identifying objects in the real world and replacing them with themed versions. With powerful enough hardware an MR headset could perform face and pose tracking on regular people changing their appearance. A game set in a fantasy setting would then look like it was in a fantasy setting replacing fire hydrants with wooden posts and people with villagers. Others players could be rendered with their armor and items.

Pokemon Go had a number of people imagining what one of these experiences might look like later. The idea of real-time battles in 3D space among different players and NPCs. An actual MR game could interact with the physical environment and introduce procedural virtual elements.

Humans vs Zombies is a game played with Nerf guns. In MR, defining boundaries (safe zones) and rules is easier. It's also easier to create powerups, abilities, and more complex mechanics. In practice one could remove the Nerf guns entirely and use virtual weapons allowing players to scavenge ammo and identify zombies and survivors from their headset. Players could also play virtually moving around separate from their physical location, but still visible to others as an avatar.

These kind of gaming experiences can be computationally demanding. Different pieces are easier than others. Various companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft have invested research into pose tracking. Getting it to run quickly and not drain one's battery is still an open area of research, though Google's work is fairly performant. It's not mandatory, but it would go a long ways to making an MR device feel feature complete.

**Mixed reality operating systems**

There's always a concern for privacy and how much will be on the cloud. As monitors are replaced at work and home, users will connect to PCs with their MR headset. This connection in theory will remain connected and is only limited by network latency and bandwidth. Operating systems on the headset and on user's PCs could move toward supporting MR devices in this way. Similarly entertainment systems that would normally control TVs and projectors would cast to one or more headset through WiFi or the Internet. It's probable that an MR device could offload compute to multiple connected PCs if one had a work and home PC based on latency and resources required.

On the actual device, this area of research is still fairly open. Meta and Magic Leap use Android which seems like it will evolve into an MR operating system over time. Apple has rumors of building a new RealityOS. The big difference between a cellphone and MR device is how multitasking can function. While a cellphone has one or maybe two foreground applications running, an MR device can have multiple pinned applications in one's FOV active at a time. For example having sticky notes on your left pinned to a wall while your work monitors are running and a weather app runs. Many of these can be in a paused state, but it's also possible to have a bunch of Bonzi Buddy/Tamagotchi apps active on one's desk. MR OSes have to handle these cases especially when one looks away or walks to another room. Some applications would also follow the headset and be in a more persistent state like if you have Google Maps directing you when walking while also playing a game. All of these applications have to take turns rendering and in many cases exist at different depths. A complex example would be an application that generates snow with snowflakes that fall in front of and behind other objects from other applications. All of this can be quite expensive on hardware and requires special rendering.

**Mainstream hardware**

So what hardware are these companies waiting for? The goal for a truly mainstream device is one that looks like a pair of glasses, lightweight, allows real light in, discrete cameras, eye tracking, face tracking, hand tracking, long battery life, and a powerful computing unit either on the device or connected wirelessly (think a phone without a display). The hardware for each of these is at various stages.

Displays: MicroLED allows for 16K per eye displays at 240Hz+ which are effectively perfect for single focal plane rendering where objects appear static in the world as the head/eyes moves. At 210x135 degrees field of view per eye that gives over 60 ppd not taking into account optics which might skew the pixels closer to the center resulting in a higher ppd where it matters. The brightness of MicroLED is also sufficiently high enough to work in any environment including direct sunlight. Companies (like JBD and Samsung) are well aware of hardware timelines and the cost associated with mass producing MicroLED displays. They require foundries on the scale of chip fabrication, but this is doable albeit expensive right now.

Optics: Metalenses are small nanostructure that can focus light. These structures are incredibly tiny and can be tuned for specific wavelengths for subpixels on a MicroLED display. Right now this technology is probably the most promising for producing glasses thin configurations. Similar to MicroLEDs these require specialized manufacturing similar to chips and might need to be printed directly over the top of MicroLEDs further complicating things. Alternatively they might need to be printed on the lenses. Another avenue is more advanced waveguides, but various companies have ran into limitations with them.

Opacity filter: This terminology might not be right, but this refers to an optical component between incoming light and the display light source. The opacity part refers to the ability to gradually block light that's incoming. If this is done on a per pixel basis it means the display can render darkness and thus shadows. Without an opacity filter all the light in the world is visible to the user and the display can only add light to the scene. Since the goal of mixed reality is to simply add objects and not disrupt the normal view of the world there's no way to make shadows unless an opacity filter can darken areas of the world by removing incoming light. This per pixel transparent piece of hardware has not yet been invented. The closest is dimming regions like in Magic Leap 2. As the component gets smaller it's believed there will be diffraction issues to deal with making this quite complex.

Cameras: [Event cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera) allow for extremely fast tracking at around 10K Hz for inside-out positioning and eye tracking. Rather than producing full pictures every frame they emit events for intensity changes at individual pixels. Their ability to detect small pixel changes makes them ideal for pretty much all tracking including face and hand tracking. It is not necessary to have a full picture of the face to extract information as muscle movements cause detectable changes elsewhere in the face. What this means is eye tracking cameras that can see a cheek might be enough to extrapolate full face movements. Also since event cameras don't necessarily deal with full images the computation required can be lower and thus more energy efficient. (There are other technical things that can further reduce power related to how they operate, but I digress). Event cameras for hand tracking are almost mandatory as tracking the hands and generating depth masks at 240Hz+ is generally not feasible using standard cameras due to motion blur. Specialized depth cameras might be doable for this, but they have to produce high quality masks. A user would expect their hand to render on top of objects and visually pass through them without appearing fuzzy on the edges. For eye tracking this high sample rate is ideal and can even be used to predict eye movements. As mentioned eye tracking is required for foveated rendering and mandatory when dealing with 16K displays as rendering that much at high quality is infeasible. Currently no company utilizes event cameras, but both Samsung and Sony manufacture them. It's unclear what plans either has for them. For reference, Apple is rumored to have 14 regular RGB cameras on their headset, which requires a lot of image processing. I'd say this indicates most companies are still a far ways off from a compact glass's friendly solution. An event camera headset I'd expect to have 4 wide angle tracking cameras and 2 eye/face tracking cameras for a total of 6 cameras.

Power: Computing in a decade will be more powerful and energy efficient. By ~2030 there will be solid-state batteries offering higher energy density, increasing the battery life for headsets. In addition wireless power phased array transmitters exist and per the FCC are allowed to operate at 15W with approval. Utilizing one of these it's possible to have a very small battery and charge continuously in an office or living room allowing unlimited use. If such wireless power is ever widespread is yet to be seen, but as the hardware becomes cheaper to produce it might be inevitable.

Computing: It's probable a standalone computing unit would connect wirelessly to a headset. This would allow the headset to be very lightweight. In the further future a 5G low-latency connection could offload work to edge servers or a person's own computer simplifying the computing requirements. Another part of all of this is offloading operations to custom ASIC chips to both free up general computing units and lower the power requirements on the device. Things like headset tracking, eye, and face tracking can be handled by a dedicated chip. Creating these chips are expensive, but the benefits of having them means a huge competitive advantage. A number of the larger companies are well-versed in producing such chips. It's also possible after a time Qualcomm will simply offer such chips. That said, it cannot be understated that some advanced scene understanding tasks using machine learning are very expensive. I foresee this being a roadblock for a while for more ambitious ideas.

Controllers: Hand tracking is one form of input, but using hands for prolonged periods of time is not ideal for many applications. Using eye tracking to select menus and a small clicker to select might be sufficient for simple applications. Both Quest Pro 3 and Magic Leap 2 have inside-out tracking cameras on the controller which paints a good direction for where controllers are going. Valve Index has a hand strap to hold the controller without gripping the controller. Combining these two setups will probably result in a future controller. An inside-out tracking camera on the back of the hand strap along with other inside-out cameras could see in all directions for each controller allowing the controllers to assist in full body pose tracking. That is the users arms and legs would be tracked by the controllers when not visible by the headset. Furthermore such camera configurations means an avatar could be generated by simply moving one's arms around for a second to get a scan. Similarly moving one's hand over something to capture data would be enough to get a detailed scan. This would use event cameras as mentioned before, so probably 3 per controller. With the headset's 6 that would be 12 total cameras that could scan the world as one walks around.

There are other hardware designs that could work for a mainstream device, but I'd argue they'd be of equal complexity. The big picture is when the hardware is ready and widespread, no company wants to be behind. Missing even one piece of the MR puzzle could be disastrous and put a company behind on market share for a long time. I will say there will be a point when Qualcomm and others offer reference designs that fulfill mainstream requirements, but companies that have a brand and widespread adoption on storefronts might be difficult to unseat. That's assuming that a company that falls behind has the cash to comeback after years.

**Metaverse**

[One of the points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse#Feasibility) raised for a metaverse type environment not taking off is the lack of the above mainstream affordable hardware. Companies like Meta weirdly ignore this point, presumably to gain brand and market share awareness by starting with VR and simpler experiences. A VR-based metaverse seems unlikely to become mainstream. [Apple's Tim Cook succinctly explained why in 2017](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41590323) when he mentioned AR doesn't isolate. Essentially an MR headset and applications can always be active while the user does other things in the world. There's no VR and the real world dichotomy where a user simply disconnects from one to use the other. A phone is a closer example where you still kind of interact with the world with a hand holding it. The primary difference is MR is more immediate and hands-free. In a conference call you can see your coworkers as they are and only the clients virtually. It's not isolating and is instead minimally virtual. This is even more minimal than a regular conference where you see their backgrounds. You just see the people.

**Conclusion**

While some companies have VR products at the enterprise or consumer level, the big picture is MR and ensuring they keep pace with competitors. It's very likely having these long-term research projects are seen as waste and thus VR products are pushed out the door to get money back. (Not that this is bad, since it's creating pancake lenses and refining controller designs). The actual mainstream MR hardware is still a ways off from being affordable to produce. Even when it's first available it'll be 5K+ USD just from the MicroLED displays I suspect. It's hard to estimate though as there are no real data-points for a lot of this hardware. I digress, but companies are definitely working toward a science fiction level device, but all the various pieces from hardware to software are 5+ years away.

As a side-note it's fascinating watching Meta burn through billions and seemingly not unlock the hardware aspect of this. (Though they do have connection to MicroLED R&D, but they are very silent on it. Their machine learning research does seem fruitful). Perhaps that shows money isn't necessarily the solution right now but time is.",0.0,Neutral,English

2022-10-04,Are the youtube platform AI and many others social media AI are corrupting the young generation?,"Are the youtube platform AI and many others social media AI are corrupting the young generation?  I've been a social media users for about 10 years now, moving from twitter to facebook, instagram and finally here reddit along with youtube. I realised, the reasons that i got depression along with porn addiction and how my life and most of the victims of depression start to fall apart during my secondary and high school was because of using social media and youtube  
i noticed that the twitter, facebook, youtube and especially tiktok AI tend to show the users news about dramas, school shootings and others inappropriate content to highschoolers or even tennagers to make us spend more time on the platform making most of us addicted to it, BUT for the tiktok AI it crossed the final line for me. It tend to show sexual content more often than most of the other platform with girls twerking, doing inappropriate things to get followers, views. when a kid see that they will get curious and watch it over and over again at the result more videos get suggested making an infinite loop of lust and depression. another the example was the tiktok trends.

All of the things above caused our generation the gen Z to dive in too deep of what called ""the virtual world"" always checking for new followers, new videos, new porns, stopping us from actual social communicate and face to face activities, causing hundred and thousands of people to get depression, to become criminals, homeless, to kill our selves  
dragging us away from the real world, from what's actually matters to us our familes, our works, our studies and most of all our FUTURE  
and since i started to notice that i deleted all of the social media apps on my phone and start working on what's actually important to me in the real world. After that all of my problems disappeared.  
I'm writing this to ask for you guys opinion about this matters to see how those platform has affected to each other life. looking foward for the answer",-0.5175977349281311,Negative,English

2022-08-29,Do Sticky Notes Improve Newcomer Behavior? A test with r/futurology,"Do Sticky Notes Improve Newcomer Behavior? A test with r/futurology Can clear community policies against harassment reduce its prevalence in a community? And what side effect (if any) do they have on freedom of expression?

In 2020, our team worked with moderators and community members of r/futurology to test the effect on newcomers of sticky comments that list community rules. This study was a replication of a 2016 study with r/science [(you can read it here in PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1813486116)). We now have results for r/futurology, as well as two other communities who tested the ideas in parallel.

In this thread, we're sharing the results to discuss the preliminary analysis. This is a space for you to ask questions, interpret the results, and  discuss how (or if) these results should influence what the community does next.

I'll be available all day to field questions. We will compile what we learn from this conversation when writing up and submitting the results for peer review with an academic publication. Thanks!

## Resources:

* [Full Study Results: How well do harassment prevention interventions transfer between communities?](https://citizensandtech.org/2022/08/)

* [Research page with full links](https://osf.io/ymv9h/)

## What we did with r/futurology

Starting in January 2020, our software observed when new posts were made and assigned discussions to receive either a sticky comment with the rules or no sticky comment at all. We then measured how many newcomer accounts commented and whether the first comment from newcomers was removed by moderators or not.

In r/futurology the message read:

&#x200B;

>Welcome to /r/Futurology! To maintain a healthy, vibrant community, comments will be removed if they are disrespectful, off-topic, or spread misinformation ([rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/wiki/rules/#wiki_6._comments_must_be_on_topic.2C_contribute_to_the_discussion_and_be_of_sufficient_length._comments_that_dismiss_well-established_science_without_compelling_evidence_are_a_distraction_to_discussion_of_futurology_and_may_be_removed.)). While thousands of people comment daily and follow the rules, mods do remove a few hundred comments per day. Replies to this announcement are auto-removed.

## What we learned

In r/futurology, we did not observe an effect of rule posting on newcomer behavior.

Chart: [https://citizensandtech.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2022-08-22-newcomer-norm-compliance-replication-576x576.png](https://citizensandtech.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2022-08-22-newcomer-norm-compliance-replication-576x576.png)

Across all subreddits on average, posting the rules increased the chance that first-time commenters would follow the rules. However, r/science was the only community with a statistically-significant effect both times. With r/ffxiv, we think the reason is that rule violations are fairly rare. With r/futurology, the cause might be the sample size issue or something else. We are eager to hear your ideas in the thread.

What effect did the sticky comment have on newcomer participation? While newcomer comments increased in the first r/science study in 2016, we did not find an affect on levels of newcomer participation in the follow-up studies. We discuss possible reasons for this in the post.

Finally, we found that the effect on moderator workload depended largely on whether the intervention increased newcomer participation or not.

## Caveats to discuss

Due to a software glitch, the study didn't have as large a sample size in r/futurology as our projections indicated we needed—we had to remove 3,600 posts (26%) of the posts from the study. We're working to see if we can gain access to historical mod logs to fill in this gap.

## Note on Ethics

Note: The study was reviewed by the moderators of the subreddit and approved by the Princeton and then the Cornell University ethics boards (Cornell protocol #1909009059). If you have any concern, we encourage you to ask it below or reach out to us directly. If you do not feel comfortable doing so, you can contact the Cornell Institutional Review Board [here](https://compliance.cornell.edu/reporting-concern).

Submission statement:

This submission is not just about stupid AI's, but about how many services, critical to our lives, detect user abuse through automated systems with no customer facing human centered appeals process.

I think the Internet is missing basic consumer protections that would demand that companies in certain industries, or running social media accounts who have such automated abuse detection, punishment systems have to have some soft of timely, open, transparent, human focused appeals process

So telecom companies, email companies, cloud storage companies, payment processors and banks, and even social media companies must support a phone number and email address where people can discuss and appeal their punishments including bannings with a human, and that the appeals and their resolution must be recorded and made available to the user",0.0,Neutral,English

2022-08-11,"TD API Callback URL ""does not conform"" issue","TD API Callback URL ""does not conform"" issue I'm trying to design a [bubble.io](https://bubble.io) app that can talk to the TD Ameritrade API. I am stuck on the initial login authorization, where you have to login to TD Ameritrade, and then an access code is given back as part of the response URL, which can then be used to obtain tokens and make calls. If I grab that code manually, I can issue the calls as needed in bubble. But where I am stuck is the callback URL that is entered into the app details in [developer.tdameritrade.com](https://developer.tdameritrade.com). It will accept localhost or [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1). But entering anything other than those localhost settings isn't accepted by the TD developer app setup. The error it gives is ""The Callback URL element does not conform to the indicated pattern.""

This was when I tried to use the special bubble redirect url I am supposed to use that is tied to the app. But as an experiment, I set up a few different callback test pages with different services so that I know for sure that they work, and TD's app setup would not accept those either. Same error. It will accept nothing other than localhost. It will allow me to put anything after localhost, like this: [http://localhost/anything\_blah\_blah\_blah](http://localhost/anything_blah_blah_blah) but that does not help what I am trying to do.

Does anyone know what to do? Thanks!

2022-05-17,"TDA turned off my ""advanced features"" so ToS doesn't show me accurate figures anymore, and disabled all my trigger orders so I lost trades, without telling me.","TDA turned off my ""advanced features"" so ToS doesn't show me accurate figures anymore, and disabled all my trigger orders so I lost trades, without telling me.  found out that for 3 days my trigger orders haven't been filled because TDA transferred me back from what support calls the ""orange"" server (ToS, with ""Advanced Features"") to the ""green"" server. They never told me they were doing this, and it removed the symbols from all my study-based trigger conditions, so the orders became invalid, but I had no way to know or see this until I happened to notice one position had moved against me very badly and a trigger order that was supposed to change my position to protect against it hadn't fired this morning, so I opened the order to examine why it hadn't fired, and saw this:

https://preview.redd.it/shqt0dp7e2091.png?width=1205&format=png&auto=webp&s=c74f9674a7c8332634b1a1f81188dec65cb69d9a

I checked, and every single one of the dozens of trigger orders I currently have set up to protect my positions is now like this. They've all been silently disabled. I have no idea how much money I've lost due to this, and support is telling me it's my problem and to reenter the orders (from memory, presumable, since I didn't write them down, because I had no close TDA was going to do this.) They aren't interested at all in my complaints that they did this without notifying me at all and that it trapped me in losing positions and I lost real money.

At least this partially explains why ToS is suddenly telling me I both have $15,000 in buying power, and, not enough buying power to buy a $200 debit spread. I mean, there's no adequate explanation for why a broker would ever give its customers false information about their account, but at least it gives some idea what triggered it to start happening. I did call and report this to them, too, and they basically shrugged. They said they didn't know why it was happening or what to do about it, and when I complained that that wasn't really solving the problem and it was keeping me from trading, the TDA phone support guy sat there saying nothing until I finally hung up.

&#x200B;

Out of respect for civility I will refrain from further editorializing but you might imagine my feelings towards TDA and ToS right now. I may be typing civilly but in my mind I am cursing like a sailor with a rash.

This is far from the first time TDA has done something that constructively sabotaged my profitability in trading.  Can they really legally just go changing around my account, disabling my trades, etc., without even bothering to tell me?

I'm thinking along the lines of: SEC complaint, FINRA complaint, call a lawyer, Better Business Bureau complaint, complaint to my state Attorney General's Office. But I'm very emotional right now, and still fairly new to dealing with the stock market and brokerages (came here last year after being a long time crypto trader) , so I'm not sure if complaining or talking to a lawyer would even accomplish anything or if it would be just wasting more time. I'd welcome any suggestions for dealing with this constructively.

The unfortunate thing is, I've just spent several months, hundreds of hours of work, building my own trading platform on TDA's API, because I can't stand ToS's bugs and limitations, and that effort has just recently gotten developed to the point where it's finally making me profitable (in this, market, yes.) So switching to another broker would mean throwing out months of work and all these advanced tools that I just got working, and rebuilding much of it again from scratch with a new API. I'm kind of stuck with TDA until I can get all that reprogrammed and make a smooth transition, which will take several months, at least. Otherwise, I'd switch brokers today. This is all too much. (I haven't even gone into detail about the 3 different unhelpful support calls last night and this morning, totaling two and a half hours on the phone, just trying to get TDA to tell me what even happened, which was a maddening multiverse of misadventure unto itself. Really, I am very over this brokerage. I've never felt so disrespected and totally uncared about by a company I was giving business to in my life.)

(Ooops, I guess I editorialized a little. Sorry, I am not happy right now.)

So, what do y'all on the internet think? Is it worth complaining to the SEC? Calling a lawyer? Switching brokers? Or is this kind of nasty surprise just what trading on the stock market is always going to be like?",-0.590438187122345,Negative,English

Imagine it's 9:30AM EST, $AAPL rises above resistance of $170 and this triggers my buying 10 contracts of 172.5 CALL at market price, my position immediately turns green, but the market is volatile, so I want to protect my profits. After trimming 2 contracts at above 20% profit , I set stoploss order on the rest of my position at entry price. $AAPL goes up more, I want to trim some more calls, but here's one problem, if I hit sell button and confirm, it invalidates the stoploss order I previously set, if the stock price suddenly drops my position may turn red. So after each trim I'll have to set my stop order again, only to be cancelled the next time I trim my position. This is very inconvenient for day trading especially when the market is volatile.

I believe that I did everything required to begin trading such as verifying bank account and identity, however a few days after I transferred money It seems I've been completely locked out of my account. 

  They didn't contact me with any information on why either through email, phone, or mail so I really don't understand the reasoning behind it. Due to this I'm not sure if I'm officially locked out or if it's just a technical error, I only had a few thousand dollars on my account at the time so I don't see any reason why it would be frozen for fraud or anything. All I know is when I try to log in on my computer it gives me a pop up saying “**You are logged out.

I checked my account, for past several months, I have been paying ""Margin balance interest"" due to I ""borrowed money from broker and thus margin balance interest"".

Until yesterday, my margin balance is **-782.18(see picture 1)**, so I guess this is the amount I owed to the broker so I transferred \~$2700 to TD, hoping to get everything clear and free of this debt ( and some left money for future investment someday)

Today, (picture 1) the web portal shows that the margin balance current value is 0.0, however, through the phone app (picture 2), it shows **a positive $1717**, which is just the same as ""cash & sweep vehicle""!!   I do expect there should be a positive balance at  ""cash & sweep vehicle"", as I transferred more than I (supposed to) owe, but :

a. why do I still have this positive ""margin balance"" at my phone app ?? b. why does the same terminology ""margin balance"" shows the difference between Web/Phone app? c. what is ""margin balance"" definition on web/Phone, are they the same? if not, which one is the correct one?

I used to use TD Ameritrade phone app only and whenever I need to investigate and had a positive margin balance, I buy some stocks.  This is where I believed I got into this ""you borrowed money from the broker and you owe our interest"" trap.

However, given the current situation( the same terminology but for different definitions and numbers through the different portal), I don't know if I feel comfortable using TD Ameritrade.

2022-08-29,Experiences as a Fidelity customer while being a transient,"Experiences as a Fidelity customer while being a transient I sold my home in June 2022 and for next 6 weeks was transient staying in hotels and Airbnbs while looking for a new home to buy.  

I changed my address to that of a virtual mail box where mail gets delivered.  I can have it forwarded to my physical location or have it scanned in and emailed to me. 

During this process, especially while  the stock market was down, I wanted to roll my ex-employer’s 401k to pretax and Roth 401ks. The request to do the rollovers triggered Fidelity’s fraud detection and locked my accounts. 

Fidelity demand I provide government issued photo ID and a rent bill, utility bill, or mortgage bill on my new residence.  

I uploaded my drivers license and my cell phone bill.  I also uploaded a letter explaining my transient situation.  Fidelity rejected these without saying why.  

I reasoned that my drivers license was rejected because it had my old address. I instead uploaded my passport card and my cell phone bill.  The former was accepted but the latter was rejected. 

So it was clear: Fidelity wanted a utility bill from an entity that had actual physical lines.  By the end of July I had my first such utility bill at my new residence. I uploaded that.  

By the first week of August my accounts were unlocked. 

Fortunately I didn’t need my assets from Fidelity to live on or to buy my new house (paid cash) during this time. 

At no time during this process was I offered the opportunity to go to a Fidelity office to straighten this out.  Or to call Fidelity.  

But the experience produced  several lessons:

1. Fidelity does not want transients for customers 

2. Fidelity does not want customers who live off the grid 

3. Get a passport or passport card 

4. If you must be transient, rent the cheapest apartment or room you can find anywhere in the USA for a month to month provided there is a rental agreement and the landlord provides rent bills.  

5. Don’t have all your assets at Fidelity. 

6. Don’t have income like wages, social security, or pension direct deposited to Fidelity 

My bank was easier to deal with.  It did lock me out for an hour when I used its app to wire transfer for the earnest money on my new home.  A simple phone call resolved that.

Fidelity’s mobile app is horrible for day and swing trading. You can’t execute bracket orders, the charts are a joke, the premarket availability and inability to place good-till-cancelled trades that include both regular and extended hours is a major handicap, and in the time it takes to adjust or cancel a stop loss or limit order the stock price can move against you substantially. The icing on the cake was not being able to trade AH today (Thursday before Easter holiday) while I could on Webull. 

Webull’s app is in another class entirely for mobile trading. You can place bracket orders, adjust limits/stops and alerts in realtime on the chart with a slider feature, and you can create limit orders at any time to be executed in extended hours trading (including premarket right as it opens). The only drawback I’ve seen with the Webull app is not being able to sell specific tax lots. 

I’m staying with Fidelity for long-term investing, but the mobile experience needs a serious revision for short term traders (the Beta version is huge step in the wrong direction imo). I’d even be happy if the mobile UI stayed exactly the same but simply allowed bracket orders and included extended hours in limit orders (which are available on Active Trader Pro).

2022-03-12,What are Fidelity's security measures for storing your password?,"What are Fidelity's security measures for storing your password? As I understand, security best practice is for companies that have password-ed logins never store your password directly on their side, only a hashed version of the password. When you enter your password, it is then hashed by the same algorithm and your entered hashed password is compared with their stored hashed password. This is so if their servers ever get hacked, hackers won't have direct access to user passwords.

I assumed this is how Fidelity works. However, when I called them recently, I was surprised when they had me enter my password via the phone keypad, with numbers for the corresponding letters (2 = ABC, 3 = DEF, etc.) and I forgot whether the pound or the star symbol for special symbols. Because of this simplified input, there's no way that the password I entered via phone keypad is comparable to the hashed version of my actual password.

Now they closes my IRA accounts again without any notices (which I opened a few days ago), and when I trying to withdraw money, I'm limited at 100k per transfer/day.

So I've started to work with millisecond data, but when I try to compare 2 stocks with each other, I realize that is rare/impossible to see a quote at the exact timestamp of another. What I mean by this is; 

AAPL - 100.42 @ 09:30:00:015

MSFT - 270.01 @ 09:30:00:027

This makes it difficult to compare in pandas, especially when using the datetime as an index. This, plus  the fact that the API (Alpaca) doesn't return the same length quotes makes cleaning this in pandas very tricky.

  
However, this would be rather easy (but tedious) in Excel. I can easily just manually match up rows based on my own judgement and then I can just read the sheet in pandas. Do you sometimes just have to grind it out in Excel to get things done? Have you ran into this before?",0.0,Neutral,English

First, as I said in original post, I understand this is not true HFT, stay away trolls.

After testing the bottleneck in my latency seem to suggest it was some combination of internet traffic and my OS ( windows server). After some suggestions I took the plunge reached out to Rithmic and rented 2 cores in a colocated VPS runnix linux.

I am not a professional programmer, python is a hobby, I learned c++ for speed. It was extremely unpleasant for me.

* I did not (and still do not) know much about Linux. I was hoping for the same Ubuntu gui my coworker has shown me. Instead they sent my an SSH login to an older CentOS without a gui. 24 hours after activating I had to embarrassingly send them an email asking to reimage because I screwed things up.
* I wrote my windows code in c++ 20, using many of the fancy new features because visual studio supports it all, GCC does not. Even the latest versions of GCC are still missing many of c++ 20's features. And the older CentOS 8 did not have latest GCC. Getting the code to compile was the hardest part.

But once it came together it was beautiful. I ran some performance test based on my algorithm, and even though my windows VPS was more powerful (more cores and faster clock), the linux machine out performed. No GUI overhead I guess.

Most importantly was the latency, I measure latency by recording when I received the tick(NTB synced clock) and comparing it against CME official tick time. I sample every 1s during RTH. With my chicago based VPS the best average latency I saw was 12.5ms, but usually much higher, Tuesday it averaged 250ms. And the standard deviations were very high. With my rithmic VPS I averaged 4ms, with only a 3ms standard deviation.

To measure turn around time I record the CME trade time for the trade the triggers my algo, and then record rithmics official time my own trade was filled. Today I averaged 9ms. I had a 17ms outlier, and a few trades had 5ms complete turn around. Consider that IBKR brags about 5ms fill times ( not including the time it takes for the order request to reach there servers), I think these are good numbers especially for only a low priced VPS.

I feel comfortable working with patterns in the 100ms bar size timeframe. As a retail trader I do not think there's any other was to decrease latency without an explosion in cost.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-12-07,Not getting the same results from Interactive Brokers TWS chart data and API data,"Not getting the same results from Interactive Brokers TWS chart data and API data Hey guys, hoping some experienced quants or fellow Algo traders who use IB could help me out 

I created a trading algorithm that looks for a specific intraday candlestick pattern using 1 minute and 5 minute candlesticks on US stocks. ( There’s a lot more to it but identifying this candlestick pattern is the key first step). Since I look at dozens of stocks at the same time, I use the reqMktData function but the OHLC data that the API receives are sometimes much different that the candlestick chart seen on TWS.

Eg AAPL at 3:50 pm 17/11/2022

TWS: 150.45 150.60 150.24 150.42

reqMktData: 150.49 150.52 150.25 150.41

I contacted IBKR and tried to fix this problem and they assured me that any discrepancy between TWS and the API was not possible and any problem may be due by specifying only SMART exchange. I have specified a the specific exchange eg NASDAQ/ NYSE but I am still receiving the same problem .

My trading bot does the following:

For each stock, through the ibapi,:  
 1) Create a Contract with exchange = 'SMART', primaryExchange = 'NASDAQ' (for example)  
 2) Initiate reqMktData stream for the Contract  
 3) FOR CANDLE PRICE: monitor tickPrice (from EWrapper) for incoming data with tickType 4  
 4) FOR VOLUME: monitor tickSize (from EWrapper) with tickType 8  
 5) After each minute (for 1m candles), we construct the OHLC using the aggregate of the data from (3) and (4)

From this, I notice a difference when comparing those candles to those you see in the TWS platform

My question is: Am I doing something wrong? Is there another way I need to go about specifying the exchange or is the problem with the settings in TWS itself? Is there a way that the candlestick charts show only dat from the primary exchange ?",0.0,Neutral,English

2022-10-01,The grey line between market intelligence and execution for trading strategies - a beta solution,"The grey line between market intelligence and execution for trading strategies - a beta solution Hi folks,

Sorry, this is likely going to be a big post that I hope is informative, provokes some discussion and offers an infrastructure solution.

When designing and building the infrastructure for an end to end automatic algo driven trading solution, there is probably a large spectrum of engineering skill sets that are aiming to achieve the same thing.

The end to end for me is defined as (ignoring performance optimization for now):

1. Capturing and processing data from multiple sources
2. Using the data to inform trading decisions/actions
3. Executing the decisions/actions

This is what you need to be in place after some phase of research and testing.

I would say, that unless you are in the world of HFT the **magic sauce or value** is entirely contained in steps 1 and 2. To clarify, this is only for non-HFT trading.

This leaves step 3, the execution, to be a layer that is still vitally important, but is something that should be able to be largely generalised and available in a library/dependency/service format. It is something that you want to be done well, but most likely you are just going to be walking well trodden paths and encountering the same issues/gotchas/solutions as many others before you.

Examples of the issues/solutions in the execution layer:

* Integrating with multiple target Broker/Exchange APIs and services and bringing them down into some general canonical format.
* Building orders in a format and with values that do not violate the constraints of the market:
   * Minimum size/value restrictions
   * price increment/granularity
   * balance/budget checks
* Achieving the best price for your decision to buy or sell within price and time bounds, for example, attempting to be a maker to get a better price point and avoiding fees before becoming a taker.
* Dealing with network and communication errors and not losing track of potentially submitted, but non communicated orders or cancels of orders.
* Not overspending a budget when you cancel and create orders in quick succession - a cancelled order might match and change in the time it took for you to cancel and then submit a new order leading to over spend.
* Scale - executing the same strategy over multiple accounts/brokerages/exchanges.

These are things that we all have to potentially deal with, and getting it right can be time consuming and error prone while not adding to your particular actual value in your trading strategy.

Soo...

I have been building a bit of infrastructure to take care of this, and would really appreciate getting a small set of beta users involved. I think it is pretty solid, but I want/need feedback.

This is only in the crypto space for now, but looking at solutions to try and pull traditional markets in as well.

If you are keen to check it out and get involved please have a look at the **Signals** section of [plurex.io](https://plurex.io)

Note to the mods: I realise this is slightly promotional, but genuinely looking for beta users here to get actively involved with building and improving. Hopefully this is on the right side of the rules.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-09-11,How to construct historical portfolio chart using TD Ameritrade API,"How to construct historical portfolio chart using TD Ameritrade API I'm using TD Ameritrade's API and want to present a historical overview of the user's portfolio. Unfortunately there is no public endpoint that does this, so I'm trying to figure out how the algorithm would look like to construct this out of the user's transaction history. 

I currently have a rough solution that looks like this: 
* get historical data for the user's tickers
* get the user's transaction history
* for each point of time (e.g., every 10mins, 1day, etc, depending on the time frame chosen) I get all shares that the user owned and the price they were bought at. I then compare them with the price for this point of time and use the difference. 

There are multiple problems with this solution though: 
* it's quite computationally heavy - for accounts with hundreds or thousands of transactions and hundreds of different tickers, this could take quite a while
* for a SELL order I don't exactly know which shares were sold. Let's say I bought AAPL at 150 and then at 180. When selling, I assume the latest ones were sold (@180), but that's just an assumption. 
* it's complicated and there are too many edge cases that need to be considered

2022-08-03,My strategy build outperforms the entire market!! A post feedback second look...,"My strategy build outperforms the entire market!! A post feedback second look... **Strategy design write-up: Bands on Autopilot part 2**

Wow, thank you to all of the people who gave me constructive feedback on my last post. Here are some of the main ideas people pointed out: Lack of long-term compiled data, clear definition on what defines beating the market, and how trading fees effect the profits of the strategy. I have read through all of the comments and given some thought to these ideas and I will be addressing them in this post. Let's start off with the lack of long-term compiled data and defining what beating the market means. Also, for those unfamiliar, here is the strategy build in question:

https://preview.redd.it/mghdxbizllf91.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bb8aaa6896ba2bed2efd257b9825e00bc0dd041

For my last post, I compared the performance of ""Bands on Autopilot"" to the performance of the S&P500 during the bear market of 2008 and the bull market of 2021. I also compared the strategy to the assets it was executed on, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL. During both of these periods my strategy outperformed the S&P500 and the assets I traded on. People pointed out that there was some level of overfitting here, so I decided to compile backtesting results from 2008-July 25th 2022. Here are the results:

https://preview.redd.it/pluh7951mlf91.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc9196c1c5f0e64fdf16ab2c9049bc9b22e70027

During this period the strategy returned an incredible 350.86% while my benchmark (S&P500) returned 123.49%. The assets we traded on returned 395.95%. There are a few things to unpack here. Firstly, the risk undertaken by ""Bands on Autopilot"" was significantly lower than that of just holding these four stocks. Yes, I got outperformed by \~45% but my exposure to \~128% less potential losses has to be considered a win on some levels. Second, year over year this strategy was extremely consistent in terms of winning trades despite a lot of market volatility. This gives more certainty for the strategic outlook than just buying and holding. If the 4 assets I traded all lost money for the next 15 years, at least I know my strategy would consistently save me a ton of money during that period.

The next logical step is to test this strategy against some different assets. To select these assets I looked up the most popular stocks on reddit for 2022 (most of which probably came from wallstreetbets). Here are the top reddit stocks listed: TSLA, GME, AAPL, AMZN, AMD, WISH, TWTR, and AMC. I also decided to select five random stocks from five different sectors. The five stocks randomly selected were BA, CHTR, MCD, PG, and XOM. Here is a screenshot of my portfolio for the second round of testing:

[Reddit loves meme stocks!](https://preview.redd.it/8j3zd0q4mlf91.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=c700fb356da0276c57a26a51a614ad993c05f67b)

Here is a 2008-July 25th 2022 breakdown of the results for this portfolio:

https://preview.redd.it/33i3hp1iemf91.png?width=2074&format=png&auto=webp&s=30116e7961e7cf1e3d7a23cef0b4ee3df7f49c22

During this period, ""Bands on Autopilot"" returned 357.98% while the benchmark returned 48.96%. The assets I traded on returned 439.73%. Compared to buying and holding the S&P500, this strategy absolutely rocks. However, buying and holding the assets in this portfolio would have yielded higher returns. These returns would come with a substantially higher risk potential of 455.02% compared to the strategies risk potential of 278.80%. Similar to the other breakdown, the percentage of overall winning trades was widely consistent. This consistency along with the risk mitigation shown instills confidence for future use of this strategy. It should be noted that in periods of heavy market losses, this strategy really shines. Anytime the S&P500 was negative on the year, the strategy was outperforming the assets it traded on by notable margins. It should also be noted that a large chunk of the asset performance came from the meme stock blow up.

Between both strategy breakdowns, the average trade return was typically somewhere between 0.05% and 0.20%. Due to many trading brokerages having fees for trading, scalping such low percentages would make this strategy unviable for long term use as you would lose more money from fees than you would make from the trades themselves. However, a brokerage that does not charge per trade, and only requires a set monthly payment for use would make this a possibility. For users who asked on the last post, slippage is accounted for within these backtests.

In conclusion, extended backtesting with multiple portfolio builds increased the frame of reference enough for me to identify the true strengths and weaknesses of this strategy. Having learned a lot from this experience, I am heading back to the drawing board to create a strategy that outperforms this one in more ways than one. Also, before I get spammed with millions of DM's and comments again asking what platform I used to construct this strategy, its called Plutofi. Just google it, linking it here is breaking subreddit rules. One other thing, thank you to the users who actually respectfully critique these strategies builds and help myself and others improve. I honestly have learned a ton about the requirements for building impactful strategies that will stand the tests of time. Looking forward to the critiques of this one! Peace! <3

2022-07-22,I finally figured out strategy that outperforms the S&P500 in both Bull and Bear markets!!,"I finally figured out strategy that outperforms the S&P500 in both Bull and Bear markets!! **Strategy Design Write-up part 2:**

Hello again,

Thanks for all of the feedback on my last strategy post. Many people pointed out that ""Short Fuse"" had a lot of hindsight bias and I would have been better off just shorting the market and holding. So, I went back to the drawing board looking for a way to find a balance in my strategy that could yield more consistent returns in any market condition. Lol that didn't happen. Given the sheer aggressiveness of that strategy I could not find a balance without completely changing everything, so I scraped it.

All of that said, I am here to present my next algotrading strategy: ""Bands on Autopilot""

**Part 1: The Strategy Build**

https://preview.redd.it/r80srcnd87d91.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=c955d73567e31e8afc876d1c62781f07f8200a63

Bands on Autopilot looks to utilize the 20 bar Simple Moving Average (SMA) by comparing is value to the 20 bar Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Bands on Autopilot also looks to utilize the Middle Bollinger Bands and compare it to the 20 bar SMA. It should be noted that the Bollinger bands are using a standard deviation of 2. To execute a buy order, the 20 bar SMA must be less than the 20 bar EMA. Or, a trade can be opened when the Middle Bollinger Bands are less than the 20 bar SMA.

Great, so we have the tools we need to open a trade, how about close it? Bands on Autopilot executes a sell order when the 20 bar SMA is greater than or equal to the 20 bar EMA. All trades for this strategy are performed on the 1 hour time frame. The strategy looks to the following assets to trade on: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL.

**Part 2: Strategy Performance**

In this section I will review the backtest results of Bands on Autopilot. The two backtests I want to explore are the how the strategy performs in the year of 2008 and the year of 2021. Obviously the year of 2008 was extremely bearish and the year of 2021 was extremely bullish.

In 2008, the S&P500 (my benchmark) returned -38.95%. When the entire market does this poorly, you can bet that practically any individual stocks during this time also perform poorly. The assets I chose to trade on suffered, managing to drop -49.55%. However, Bands on Autopilot is rather good at stomaching these drops and mitigating loses. Here are the results for the 2008 crash:

https://preview.redd.it/ouygcc1f87d91.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c477c03cb63b399bfd4ddd826220bf8ea0bfb84

After looking over the backtesting data provided above, you can see that the 4 assets I traded on lost \~50% and this strategy a decent -22.40%. Not the greatest results in the words but dodging a 25% drop is something to be proud of. Dodging this bullet does come with some risk as my strategy has a sharpe ratio of -0.75. A poor sharpe ratio in this market environment is honestly not super surprising. It should be noted that I only had a risk of losing 33.91% while the assets I traded on lost far more. A poor risk score in this market environment is honestly not super surprising.

Alright, so we established that this strategy can hold its own in a very aggressive bear market, how does it do during the face ripping bull markets? Here are the backtest results for the 2021 bull market:

https://preview.redd.it/ffh9a02h87d91.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=e66b8b59e82ae2712642688806f6853a789c2957

Wow! This strategy really does shine in a bull market, returning close to 40% while the S&P500 returns 26.54%. These returns are backed by low risk potential and a great sharpe ratio of 1.5. Note: the assets I traded on also beat the S&P500 by a solid 11% and still performed worse than Bands on Autopilot.

**Part 3: Conclusions**

I designed this strategy with intention of outperforming the market in bullish and bearish periods while remaining consistently risk averse. This balance comes at the cost of huge gains, but you are rewarded with a level of trading safety that is similar to the S&P500 all while producing higher returns. Bands on Autopilot could likely be pushed further with more experimentation and the introduction of stop losses/take profit functions. I plan to play around with that and make a future post. For now, I would love to hear your feedback on this strategy! ""The best market strategies are ones that perform in a consistent manner during all market conditions.

1) Set a stop limit order through my broker (Alpaca) that gets triggered once the buy price is reached. 

Pros: Simple to implement, guaranteed that the target buy price has actually been hit. 

Cons: If the price breaks through the target too quickly, the order will not get filled (and this will only happen with potentially winning trades, whereas the order will fill for all losing trades)

2) Monitor the ask through a websocket (I use polygon.io) and place a market buy as soon as the ask hits the target buy price. 

Pros: Potentially less slippage relative to the backtest, and a guarantee that my order will execute. 

Cons: The ask could get front run for fractions of a penny and I might end up buying at a ""better"" price which is less than my target price. This sounds potentially attractive, but my trading strategy is based heavily on the thesis that this 10%-above-open price will be hit. In this scenario, I could end up buying into a stock that has not yet reached that price, deviating from my backtests. 

I know that there is no correct answer and that is depends on a lot of factors, but that is why I have made this post. What does it depend on?

2022-07-12,Algotrading strategy I built for aggressive shorting during bear markets!,"Algotrading strategy I built for aggressive shorting during bear markets! **Strategy Design Write-up: Short Fuse**

Hello,

I came up with a strategy that I think is awesome for algorithmic day trading in bear markets. I wanted to do a little breakdown and get some opinions on it. I am going to test this strategy against historical data of AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL and AMZN. I am analyzing historical performance in hopes that it will help me understand how the strategy would perform on the live market. The strategy name is ""Short Fuse,"" lets see how it does!

**Part 1: The Strategy Build**

https://preview.redd.it/b325hkkrj8b91.jpg?width=1260&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d9b24f831edf84870e95c4fd017ec72021c892d

Visual for understanding on how my strategy makes trades

Short Fuse looks to utilize the 25 bar EMA by comparing its value to the Simple Moving Average (SMA). Short Fuse also looks to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to gauge overall price momentum and better time position entries. To execute a short, the 25 bar EMA must be greater than the 20 bar SMA and the RSI must be greater than or equal to 70 (overbought territory).

Sweet, now we have the tools to open a short, how about to cover it? Short Fuse executes a short cover when the 25 bar EMA is less than or equal to the 15 bar SMA and the RSI is less than or equal to 35 (almost oversold territory). You may have noticed that position covers are taken with a tighter SMA, this subtle change allows the strategy to lock in gains on quick drops in price action.

During my backtests of Short Fuse, all trades were executed on the 5 minute time frame and utilized all market hours.

**Part 2: Strategy Performance**

In this section I will review the backtest results of Short Fuse. The two backtests I want to explore are the how the strategy performs in the year of 2008 and the year of 2013. Obviously the year of 2008 was extremely bearish and the year of 2013 was extremely bullish.

In 2008, the S&P500 (my benchmark) returned -38.95%. When the entire market does this poorly, you can bet that practically any individual stocks during this time also perform poorly. The assets I chose to trade on suffered, managing to drop a staggering -49.55%. However, Short Fuse is incredible at posting gains during these market conditions. Here are the 2008 results:

https://preview.redd.it/gqtjxettj8b91.jpg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a23bb05bbd79cc6a51e7273aef71648471542a9a

You're seeing that correct, while the 4 assets I traded on lost \~50% and this strategy returned 31.94%. Normally returns like this mean you are undertaking significant risk. In reality, Short Fuse maintained a risk score of just 1.46, 0.46 above the industry standard. This strategy is a monster in bear markets and really only falls short in the cash utilization section because it isn't always in a position.

Cool, this strategy is insane and will make us all rich right? Wrong. Aggressive shorting works out really well during a bear market but during a bull market? Here are the results from the bull run of 2013:

https://preview.redd.it/5b7j92pxj8b91.jpg?width=1140&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18854de85c9603745e5216a45de50c8bc19b9cfb

Ouch. Short Fuse can't handle bull markets meaning that well timed execution of this strategy is essential for your portfolios success. Missing the S&P500 by 45% is proof this strategy could never be used blindly without risking a huge amount of ones capital.

**Conclusion:**

This strategy was built with the intention of profiting as much as possible from a bear market. As history shows once again, putting all your eggs in one basket can get you hurt. Using a strategy like this requires timing the market which is never recommended. However, it's likely that some careful changes can reduce the overall gains of a bear market and decrease the overall risk brought from a bull market. An important lesson to take from this is that you can almost never have one without the other. The best market strategies are ones that perform in a consistent manner during all market conditions. Risk management is everything when you have everything to lose. I got some opinions on the daytrading subreddit and I was curious to hear some opinions over here!

Edit: Thank you for all of the feedback, I realize that going short during this entire period would have been able to outperform my strategy here. This is sort of a first test on a developing strategy that I wanted feedback/insight from other users so that I could make it better.  I'll be back with an update for ya after I workshop this.

Every trade has a commission, spread, and slippage to consider.

&#x200B;

Let me preface that I'm new to algotrading, trying to learn all I can, so everything that follows might be wrong.

&#x200B;

If I buy 20K$ and later sell each of the following assets

\- AAPL (stock),

\- BTCUSD (crypto),

\- EURUSD (forex),

\- MES MICRO E-MINI S&P 500 FUTURE (futures),

in which case do I have the lowest cost per trade?

&#x200B;

**AAPL**, let's consider IBKR fixed for the fees:

AAPL 150$ --> 20K$ approx 133 shares --> USD 0.005 per share, 1$ min order --> so 1$ + 0.5$ reg fees

Regulatory Fees:

SEC Transaction Fee: USD 0.0000229 \* Value of Aggregate Sales (20K$?) = 0.485

FINRA Trading Activity Fee: USD 0.00013 \* Quantity Sold (133?) = 0.01742

AAPL buy and sell total fees = 1.5$\*2 = 3$ --> 3/20K = 0.015%

&#x200B;

**BTCUSD**, let's consider Binance for the fees:

0.1% maker/taker fees --> 20$

BTCUSD buy and sell total fees = 20$\*2 = 40$ --> 40/20K = 0.2%

&#x200B;

**EURUSD**, let's consider IBKR for the fees:

0.20 basis point \* Trade Value --> 0.2\*0.0001\*20K$ = 0.4$

Minimum per order Tier I - USD 2.00 --> so it should be 2$

EURUSD buy and sell total fees = 2$\*2 = 4$ --> 4/20K = 0.02%

Considering a 5X leverage the fee is:

EURUSD buy and sell total fees 5X leverage = 2$\*2 = 4$ --> 4/100K = 0.004%

How much does the borrowed capital for leverage cost?

&#x200B;

**MES MICRO E-MINI S&P 500 FUTURE**, let's consider IBKR fixed for the fees:

E-micro Futures and Futures Options USD 0.25/contract + Exchange Fee + Regulatory Fee

S&P 500 Index ≈ 4K$

MES MICRO E-MINI S&P 500 FUTURE CONTRACT SIZE $5 x S&P 500 Index = 20K$ --> 1 contract --> 0.25$ + 0.32$ reg fees

CME Exchange Fees:

Exchange Fee Recovery Charge USD 0.30

Regulatory Fee Recovery Charge 0.02$

MES MICRO E-MINI S&P 500 FUTURE buy and sell total fees = 0.57$\*2 = 1.14$ --> 1.14/20K = 0.0057% ≈ 0.005%

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought forex had the lowest fees, but maybe it is only valid for at least a standard lot.

&#x200B;

**To summarize:**

|asset|fee|fee%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|EURUSD5X|0.8x|0.004%|
|MES|1x|0.005%|
|AAPL|3x|0.015%|
|EURUSD|4x|0.02%|
|BTCUSD|40x|0.2%|

&#x200B;

**What about spread and slippage?**

I do know it's challenging to give values.

Considering the top 20-30 most liquid assets for each category, which has the best spread and slippage?

I would say forex is the best as it is the market with the highest liquidity in the world, 2 pips should be a reasonable estimate for spread and slippage should not be a big concern for an average retail trader.

Looking for sentiment score data for any given company/ticker (eg. AAPL). Historical data is a good to have but not necessary, whilst number of assets is of higher priority.

I have downloaded a CSV file of active stocks from AlphaVantage, and I was using the stock tickers to keep track of number of mentions of each stock in the wallstreetbets subreddit. However, I noticed that this method is not entirely accurate; many posters mention a stock by the short name instead of the company ticker (eg ""Apple"" instead of ""AAPL""). Since the short display name of the stock is not available in the CSV file downloaded from AlphaVantage, does anyone know where I can get the display names of the stock for free? I have tried [https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com/](https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com/) and their /v6/finance/quote endpoint does offer what I need, but unfortunately, there is a limit on the number of requests for the free plan.",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-06-30,Nasdaq Data Link Subscription Issues,"Nasdaq Data Link Subscription Issues Update: I am having a very good and lengthy discussion with a sales representative and now have no more complains but praises. It appears that the sales contact form might not have worked correctly and I was set up by the support team using a 'contact us' form.

\---

I am trying to get a subscription price quote from Nasdaq for way more than 2 weeks now. When I am locked into my account and search for the premium data subscription offer, I get an offer for annual billing and no history along with a link to contact sales. Clicking on the link I get a form where some of my account info's are filled in along with some text fields including the message field, which I used to submit my message to sales.

I also recently found the Contact Us for one having questions which I also used to contact the folks over there.

What I did not found was a phone number for some random call center as they usually have access to see if my requests were viewed at or exist at all.

Since I answered a lot of questions creating my account and the system presenting  me the data subscription option on its own, I guess, I would be allowed to subscribe to the data I am interested in.

Further more I received a coupon from them to get the next subscription 20% off so I am on a timer here :-).

Bunch of questions:

\- Has anyone made similar experiences?

\- Is anyone using Nasdaq Data Link service (especially as an non-professional individual (yes that is a thing))?

\- Has anyone a phone number I can call? Any more message and I might get flagged for being a spammer :-).

\- Is there a price list other than [nasdaqtrader.com](https://nasdaqtrader.com) or [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com). I do not found any price list for any of the [data.nasdaq.com](https://data.nasdaq.com) offerings. If [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) is correct I would have to pay somewhat 500$ a month, which is nothing compared to the time I spent to get price quotes from Nasdaq partners and the fun I head writing about my quest to get this data and talking about it... .",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-06-11,Discrepancies between minute level data from different sources (tradingview and polygon),"Discrepancies between minute level data from different sources (tradingview and polygon) I was trying to get my own backtesting system in place in Python because I want to use the same strategy code for both testing (using polygon.io data) and trading (using IBKR). However, I started out on TradingView and was getting good results with the strategy.

The problem is twofold:

1) The minute level data of TradingView and Polygon.io have discrepencies 

Example:

* **Data From Polygon.io**
* Volume, VolWtPeriod, Open, Close, High, Low, Time, Transactions
* 62298	37.8522	37.9	        37.855	37.9	        37.81	1654265460000	551		
* 44809	37.8253	37.86	37.83	37.87	37.7901	1654265520000	428		
* 18796	37.8872	37.84	37.9	        37.94	37.83	1654265580000	217		

* **Data From Tradingview**
* Time, Open, High, Low, Close
* 1654265460	37.9	        37.9	        37.82	37.86	-0.013628297370234556
* 1654265520	37.86	37.87	37.8	        37.8	        -0.022360954548373016
* 1654265580	37.85	37.89	37.84	37.89	0.010382078035206632

Most of these are only off my a cent or two, but they are different and I was wondering why.

2) The ewm/sma/MACD I am calculation in Python using the Pandas_ta seems to be delayed exactly one minute from the TradingView results. This ends up being a huge difference in my own backtrader as to whether this is successful. Has anyone seen this same one-period shift when moving from TradingView to their own code outside of tradingview?",0.0,Neutral,English
2022-05-29,does is make sense to combine DCA with Auto-Rebalancing (crypto)?,"does is make sense to combine DCA with Auto-Rebalancing (crypto)? I've looked at a couple of services that offer DCA and rebalancing ""bots"" (e.g. kucoin, 8commas.io, gate.io etc.). However, they don't offer a combination of these too. It's either (a) you start your DCA bot or (b) go for a rebalancing method.

Do you think it would make sense to combine these two investment strategies? I can't get my head around this... I have the feeling that it could be counterproductive but I'd really like to see/do some backtesting for this. Maybe you have an idea how this could be backtested (quickly)?",0.0,Neutral,English

2022-01-17,High quality data provider,"High quality data provider Hi, I'm part of an early stage quant fund, and we are looking for a high quality data provider of US traded stocks.
We have been using polygon.io for about a year, but we found that quality of data is lacking.
Missing bars, bars not adjusted for splits, mismatched volume between different aggregation times, etc.

Here are the requirements for the data:
* At least minute-level bars, for at least 15 years (i.e. including GFC), preferably 25 years (i.e. including dot-com bubble)
* Need to have delisted tickers
* Data should already be adjusted for splits & dividends (preferably), or they should be provided alongside.
* HIGH quality, as few mistakes/gaps/bugs as possible
* Either no requests limit or very high limit, should be possible to download all the data in less than a week.
* Preferably also have access to real-time/streaming bars.
* Preferably Linux compatible (e.g. REST) API.
* We are located outside US (Russia), so Data Provider should allow international customers.

We are currently only interested in US Equities and our data budget is $50k/year.

Looking through other posts, I have seen that iqfeed.net, algoseek.com, esignal.com & kinetick.com being recommended.
Comments regarding them would be appreciated, any other suggestions are also welcome.

I wrote a blog post on the Exponentiated Gradient algorithm and its variants. It can be used for selecting a portfolio from a set of stocks. It is computationally inexpensive (linear per iteration) and has the universal portfolio property (asymptotic average regret is 0). The post includes a gist with code for the algorithm and backtests on simulated and historical data.
