2021-12-22,RH account hacked. Money stolen and account was deactivated.,"RH account hacked. Money stolen and account was deactivated. Sorry this isnt a penny stock post. But need help! 

Like the title says my account was hacked. Money was stolen and account deactivated. I got a notification that my account balance was being transfered via a Furniture store debit card. 

The hackers have seemed to deactivate my account and robinhood cant find it when i try to log in or reset my password. 

I sent RH support an email but can't seem to get a phone number for support (since I cant get into my account). 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get in contact with RH by phone. Or if I will be able to get my money back?
 

Thanks.",-0.7097359895706177,Negative,English

Oh Mr. Market, what a wild and unpredictable bitch you are! Major indexes rose on Friday despite inflation posting its biggest 12-month increase in nearly four decades. The Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) added 1%, while the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) gained 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively. The small-cap focused Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) was the only laggard, falling by 0.3%.

Power hour was real today, as indexes churned higher in the last hour of trading. According to today's CPI numbers, inflation rose 0.8% for the month of November, higher than the 0.7% that economists expected. Inflation is rising on a 6.8% basis year-over-year, which is the fastest pace since 1982. 

As I said yesterday: ""CPI numbers also could be not as bad as expected, shorts get trapped, and we see some action to the upside."" I think a bit of high inflation is priced in at this point, and shit, inflation can be good for equities. It's the fear of interest rate hikes that scare the shit out of investors. There was plenty of opportunities to make money up *and* down today. 

Small cap stocks continue to get punished, as investors flee to safer havens, like Apple (AAPL), which has gained an incredible 20% in the past month. AAPL and Microsoft (MSFT) both ran hard today, and when that happens, it's hard to keep the market down. 

I'm surprised there wasn't a late day sell off, which has seemed to be regular for Fridays recently. Maybe managers are in risk-on mode, or maybe Monday it's the longs' turn to get trapped.

Notes:

**AVCT +21.81% (-1.31%)** After taking off nearly 120% yesterday, AVCT wasn't done seeing nearly double the trading volume today, with nearly 290 million shares changing hands. The company announced an expanded partnership to accelerate the delivery of digital transformation as a service solutions, according to a news release. Option volume quadrupled from Thursday, as shorts continue to get trapped, driving share price pressure upwards. Will be interesting to see what the open interest numbers look like on Monday. 

**AMRN +0.9% (+0%)** AMRN stock has been on hard times recently, following the entire biotech industry downward. The trend has been prolonged for the company since an unfavorable patent ruling in March 2020. While the rest of the market has ripped higher, AMRN has continued to bleed. The current share price is near the bottom that AMRN has found several times since March 2020, which could provide a level of support for a swing upwards. The bulk of the option activity stemmed from 3,000 diagonal put spreads with the January 2022 $10 put and Jan 2023 $7 put. 

**ARDX -7.59% (+2.74%)** Stocks that take on huge share price activity and social media sentiment generally have days far worse that ARDX had today. 31 million shares traded today, or two times the average volume. The heaviest bets are still being placed on the January $2.50 calls, according to the open interest. 

**ABUS -3.94% (+1.93%)** Volume came off a bit for ABUS today, with the stock seeing less than it's average of 9.5 million. Open interest and implied volatility suggest that the Dec $4.50 calls are being sold more than bought. There's significant open interest on out of the money calls expiring next week. 

**XSPA -3.8% (+1.69%)** XSPA has been on an upward trend since reporting earnings in mid-November, and has been trading above its 20-day moving average since. The share price has reached a relative high of a volatility range defined by Keltner channels. The Omicron variant of covid is I guess bullish news for the company, as they partner with the CDC to provide testing for air travel. A good portion of the option activity came from 4,000 diagonal call spreads using the January $1.50 calls and March $2 calls. 

**NXE -2.91% (+0%)** NXE has been on a downward trend since reporting earnings in early November, and is trading in a below average range, under the 20-day moving average. The downward trend seems to have lessened, and while there is some consolidation going on, NXE could use some oomph to the upside. Nearly all of the option volume stemmed from 2,500 call spreads in January between the $5 and $6 strikes. 

**SAN +0.66% (+0.33%)** SAN announced today that it was ordered to pay $76 million to Italian banker Andrea Orcel after SAN withdrew its offer to make Orcel their CEO. Oops. This stock has been trading in an extremely low range after starting its recent downward trend in November. 

**NAUT -7.3% (+5.25%)** There's no recent news for this company, which is creating a platform for quantifying and unlocking the human proteome. This stock only recently starting trading in August 2020, and has pretty much slid since then. It looks like the stock did recently double bottom on a daily chart near the beginning of the month, and closed today basically at its 20-day moving average. This could be the start of a small upward trend, but it has only been a few days. Open interest is highest for the March $5 calls, at just over 4,000.

**RAIL +6.67% (+0.72%)** No recent news for RAIL, and it looks like something about the Jan $5 calls and the price action caught the attention of trading algorithms. RAIL has risen 24% in the last week after double bottoming around $3.30.

**VYNE +8.7% (+0%)** No news that I could find for VYNE. The stock severely broke out of its downward trend on Dec 6, and is not pushing the highs of the volatility range. There were 41 million shares traded today, which is 27 times its average volume. 

**BLRX +18.06% (+4.10%)** BLRX had been trending downward since mid-October. The stock fell to its 52-week low of $2.05 on Monday, and has since bounced to the upside. 

&#x200B;

Next week we get producer price index numbers on Tuesday, FOMC economic projections & statements on Wednesday, and Unemployment numbers on Thursday. Who's bullish on a Santa rally? Who thinks the sky is falling?

Have a great weekend, y'all!

2021-11-10,Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 11/10,"Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 11/10 Hey gang!

Stocks got hammered today, as higher than expected inflation readings had a cascade of effects on the market. The small-cap focused Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) led the way lower, shedding 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) fell 1.4%, while the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) lost 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively. 

So what happened? Consumer price index numbers came in higher than expected. CPI jumped 6.2% from a year ago, greater than the 5.9% that was expected. The 6.2% annual increase in CPI is the largest annual increase since 1990, which I have to constantly remind myself wasn't like 10 years ago. 

So the indicators are screaming ""INFLATION IS HIGH"", so money flowed *out* of stock and *in* to bonds, causing the 10-year Treasury bond yield to rise by 10 basis points. With rising inflation that is currently proving to *not* be transitory, the Federal Reserve might be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected. The futures market is basically pricing in interest rate hikes in July now. 

Rising interest rates makes debt more expensive to hold. Many tech and high growth stocks have a lot of debt, as they use their debt to facilitate growth. When debt is more expensive to hold, these stocks become less attractive investments. Which is why IWM and QQQ fell the hardest today, even when SPY's top holdings skew heavily toward tech stocks. 

As a result, the utilities (XLU) and consumer staples (XLP) sectors rose today, as these are considered ""safer"" bets in inflationary environments. However, taking the wide view, over the last few months the two best performing sectors of the S&P 500 have been energy (XLE) and consumer discretionary (XLY). 

XLE makes sense, as oil, natural gas, and uranium have been going bananas. XLY's performance is interesting, because this sector isn't considered as much as an inflationary hedge. In times of inflation, it's expected that consumer spending will decline in non-essential items. The fact that XLY has outperformed SPY over the last month or so could mean that consumers are not so off put by inflation that they aren't willing to spend. 

I was looking at various asset classes the other day and was surprised that SPY, the U.S. Dollar (DXY) and gold (GLD) are *all* on relative upward trends. Usually DXY and GLD kinda inverse each other. The lack of divergence between the two could mean that inflation, while absolutely higher than usual, is pushing *all* asset classes higher. This could mean that while costs are increasing, the buying power of the dollar is rising in tandem, which could offset some of the harsher effects of inflation. 

Obligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, etc. etc. etc.

Notes:

**SOS -30.81% (+2.05%)** SOS sent out an SOS after announcing a $90 million direct offering at $1.75 per share, a discount to the market. 

**PROG +3.23% (+3.12%)** PROG holders have got to be on a roller coaster of emotion right now. After opening to a more than 10% gain, PROG slowly bled the gains away over the day. The stock plunged immediately after the close, briefly posting a 20% loss, before recovering. It's currently all over the place after hours after reporting earnings. No big Pfizer announcement like some predicted, rather a vague ""entered into an additional partnership with a large pharmaceutical company"". $9.6 million in revenue, with a net loss per share of $0.46. 

**TELL -15.56% (+1.05%)** TELL fell after announcing a public offering of senior notes. After ending the quarter debt-free, TELL took some on to finance operations and to buy upstream assets. 

**SENS -0.53% (+1.07%)** SENS rose to a more than 13% gain early in the session, before giving it all back and then some. The company reported earnings after the bell yesterday, so someone liked what they saw, bought in, and others took the opportunity to book profits. 

**ATIP +32.32% (-0.51%)** ATIP reported earnings after the market closed yesterday, then received a gift of over 18x its average volume. 

**IVR -1.53% (+0%)** No news. 

**KPLT -13.22% (+7.01%)** KPLT close just below the $5 penny stock threshold, and has proceeded to pare losses after hours. Losses today were most likely from profit taking from the large earnings based share price increase. 

**AUY +2.11% (+0%)** No news. I'm surprised that with inflation numbers coming in so hot that there aren't more gold stocks on this list today. 

**BBD +4.8% (+0%)** BBD's CEO told analysts today that the bank is considering expanding its digital banking operations to new countries such as the US an Mexico. A good chunk of the option volume came from a single order for 12,500 of the Jan 2024 $4 puts. Most likely a big long choosing a green day to hedge their position on the cheap. 

**MARK +1.31% (+0%)** MARK shot up to a more than 13% gain at one point, then bled it all away. The chart looks like some short covering. MARK has been on this list 10 of the last 12 days, tied only with PROG. 

**SOLO -8.25% (+2.25%)** After a month long upward trend, the market took some profits off SOLO after earnings. 

**MNMD -7.8% (+2.82%)** No news, but MNMD stock continues to walk down, having shed 15% in the past week. 

**PHX +1.28% (+0%)** No news. 

**SOXS +8.75% (-0.65%)** Bear ETFs did great today as the market shit the bed. 

**LOTZ -10.55% (+1.88%)** LOTZ gave back all of the earnings increase and then some. 

**OWLT +12.86% (-11.63%)** OWLT ran hard all day just to dump after releasing Q3 results after hours. Revenue increased, but net loss widened. Didn't provide any future guidance because of their Smart Sock's regulatory issues. 

**GOCO +8.55% (+0.43%)** GOCO topped out the day at a 20% gain, rising after announcing Q3 results yesterday after the bell. 

**ORC -1.8% (+0.61%)** ORC slipped a bit a day after announcing a November monthly dividend of $0.065 per share. The real story here is the 14x relative volume for options, driven by a single order for 4,908 Jan 2022 $5 calls. It's pretty crazy that those options are only $0.06 out of the money, have over 2 months of time value left, and were traded for $0.05/contract. 

**KNDI -1.67% (+2.42%)** KNDI shares had a bounce at the open after unveiling its first off road all electric utility vehicle. This stock just hit its 52-week low. 

**BRFS -1.62% (+0%)** The company supposedly will report earnings today after market close, but I haven't seen anything yet. 

**RGS +3.46% (+0%)** I drove past a SuperCuts yesterday that had a sign out front offering a $1,000 sign on bonus. 

**RCAT +0.78% (-1.16%)** No news. 

**ALZN -18.56% (+3.72%)** ALZN continues to freefall, down 93% from its IPO in mid-June. 

**UBX +23.35% (+0.95%)** UBX reported Q3 earnings and was given a $5 price target upgrade by Mizuho. 

**UPH -2.4% (+6.97%)** UPH is up after hours after announcing Q3 results. Revenue up, and more importantly, gross margins expanded. 

**BTG +2.73% (+0%)** Could have had increased option activity as a long-term bet against inflation or (and I hope it's this one) it could have risen because it has the same ticker symbol as Bitcoin Gold and crypto was running hard this morning. 

**CBAT -5.65% (+0%)** CBAT continues to fall after the large share price increase on Monday. 

**BQ -9.87% (-1.99%)** I dunno. 

**BMRA +10.9% (-0.63%)** I'm tired at this point, tbh. 

**CSPR -9.38% (+0%)** I imagine CSPR dropped as a sympathy play to PRPL. It appears the market expects CSPR to have as abysmal earnings as PRPL.

Markets were STOKED despite the Federal Reserve announcing that the tapering of the Fed's $120 billion per month in bond purchases will start soon. I speculate that the market was more hyped that the Fed has yet to signal when they will use their tools to address inflation. 

The S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY), Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ), and Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) all hit new highs today, gaining 0.7%, 1.4%, and 2%, respectively. SPY finished above $465, a level at which I had far-dated speculative (aka CHEAP at the time) call options expire on Friday. The consolation prize of being right isn't quite as satisfying as the timing of being right, you know?

Notes:

**GNUS +5.11% (+0.69%)** No news for GNUS (hey that rhymes!). GNUS was up nearly 10% at one point, and has been on this list 7 out of the last 12 days. There was noticeable (\~16K) activity on the call side of the option chain for the January 2022 expiry, but it appeared to be a lot of algorithmic trading. Open interest for that particular monthly expiration blows the rest out of the water with over 153,000 options - the majority of them calls. Coincidentally, January is when GNUS is projected to release their next earnings report. 

**EXPR +0% (+0%)** After opening to a more than 10% gain, EXPR broke even. No news of late, however, EXPR stock has gained more than 10% in the last week. 

**SENS +0% (+0%)** SENS was down it was up, it was all around...and it broke even. With no news and kind of wacky share price movement, I'm willing to be a decent chunk of the option volume was quick scalps. Interesting to note that the most active option, the January 2022 $7 call, is significantly out of the money, and saw nearly 13.9K of volume in the last hour on 5 orders alone. Impossible to tell if these were positioned opened or closed, as the January 2022 expiry shows over 209,000 options in the open interest. SENS reports earnings next week. 

**IVR +1.25% (+0%)** IVR reported quarterly results after the bell. Looks like analysts expected IVR to report $0.09 in earnings per share to go with $43 million in revenue. The company announced net income per share of $0.17 and earnings available for distribution per common share of $0.10. IVR apparently uses so many non-GAAP financial measures in their report that it's tough to decipher positive from negative. One of the leading metrics they go by is book value per share, which on its own isn't super useful, although IVR increased by this metric 1.2%. The stock isn't really moving in after hours trading, so it's impossible to say how the market ""feels"" about it yet. 

**OPK +6.49% (-2.48%)** OPK has been on a steady upward trend, having gained 19% in the last week. The company reported earnings on Monday, beating estimates for both EPS and revenue. 

**TELL +4.35% (-1.62%)** TELL announced third quarter earnings results this morning before the market opened, missing revenue expectations by 48%. However, the stock surprisingly trended higher. After the market closed TELL announced a public offering of 8.25% senior notes due 2028. Lower-than-expected revenue numbers and any kind of offering would generally be looked at as unfavorable news, so I'm kind of surprised that TELL has managed to remain positive today. 

**MNMD +0.36% (+0%)** MNMD shares opened to a 3% loss, swung to a 4% gain, then fell to remain relatively flat. Earnings are expected next week, and there are over 50,000 ITM call options in the open interest currently, all at the $2.50 strike.  

**RLX +2.95% (-0.61%)** No news for RLX, however, it should be noted that the majority of the option activity came from 4,500 call spreads for January 2022 at the $5 and $10 strikes. Implied volatility suggests that the $5 calls are being bought and the $10 calls are being sold, so this *could* be debit spreads.

**CRDL -25.22% (+1.18%)** CRDL cratered after announcing a public offering of 16.3 million units at $3.07 per unit. One unit represents one share and half a warrant, so the offering represents a discount to the market. It does, however, generate CRDL over $50 million. It's notable that the most popular option, the June $5 call saw an order for 3,500 of these options. With only 247 total options in the open interest for this expiry, this was most likely a big bet in a rebound of the share price in the future. 

**AMRN -12.03% (+0.24%)** AMRN tanked after missing revenue expectations in its third quarter earnings report. 

**MARK -11.94% (+0.56%)** I find it fascinating that MARK continues to keep any kind of retail trading interest. After popping hard during the DWAC frenzy, MARK has done nothing but bleed back to earth. Regardless, the open interest and implied volatility suggest that option traders are snapping up the $2, $2.50, $3.50, and $5 calls. Of the 83,000 options in the OI that expire this month, only 3,300 calls are in the money. 

**UEC +9.5% (+1.37%)** A rising tide lifts all ships. That could explain UEC's rise today, as Bank of America upped its rating on Cameco to a ""buy"", giving it a CAD$40 price target in the process. Another penny favorite, DNN, benefitted as well, climbing nearly 9%. 

**OWLT +5.6% (+1.59%)** After spending most of the trading session in the red, OWLT came alive after lunch to finish with a solid gain. No news, and it appears that a lot of the option trading was algo scalps. 

**TGB +1.82% (+1.79%)** TGB's daily chart is kind of similar to OWLT's. Red most of the day, started to rise later in the session. TGB reported earnings, announcing adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $0.10 per share and $132.6 million in revenue, both of which beat expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $76 million is 60% higher than Q2 and 140% higher than Q3 2020. We'll see how the market reacts tomorrow. Nearly all of the option activity came from a single order for 5,000 Dec $2.50 call options. Open interest shows only 2,400 options at this strike, so it appears someone made a big bullish bet on TGB earnings. 

**RGS +5.82% (-0.97%)** RGS reported third quarter earnings after the bell, announcing a net loss per share of $0.28 and $77.8 million in revenue. Net loss decreased due to the company exiting loss making salons, which also caused revenues to fall. Will be interesting to see how the market reacts tomorrow. 

**GOED -1.97% (-0.34%)** GOED announced that it announced a new VP of Distribution and Logistics, formerly of FedEx and DHL. The company announced yesterday that they will report third quarter earnings on November 15. Nearly all of the option volume came from a single order of 5,000 December $3 calls. Considering this option only had 65 in the open interest, it's reasonable to think that someone bought these options, taking a relatively short-term bullish position on GOED. 

**GNW -4.19% (+0%)** GNW reported third quarter earnings yesterday after the bell. The company beat on both EPS and revenue expectations, but the stock sold off anyways. Most likely investors were off put by forward guidance or something in the earnings call. 

**VYGR +2.57% (-0.25%)** After opening to a 2% loss, VYGR recovered after announcing earnings yesterday before the market opened. VYGR beat EPS estimates, but lagged on revenue. Option traders appear to be encouraged by the results, as calls outnumber puts in VYGR's open interest more than 3-to-1. However, it should be noted that a good portion of the option activity came from over 1,000 call spreads at the April expiry between the $5 and $7.50 strikes. 

**SRGA +6.54% (+0.88%)** SRGA announced its plans to release third quarter financial results on November 9, after the market closes. There must have been something about the January 2022 $2.50 call that attracted option algorithm attention, as the majority of the volume stemmed from this kind of trading. 

**PEI -0.51% (+1.54%)** PEI saw a bit of extra attention as they are scheduled to report third quarter earnings tomorrow before the market opens. Calls outnumber puts in the open interest more than 2-to-1 and today's trading volumes saw calls favored over puts over 5-to-1.

**LLNW +2.57% (+0.63%)** LLNW opened in the red then steadily rose throughout the day. LLNW is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow after the market closes, so I suppose we'll see LLNW on this list again tomorrow. Much like PEI, calls dominate the open interest and recent trading volumes. 

**IO +12.34% (-9.85%)** IO reported earnings today after the bell, handily beating EPS and revenue expectations. IO needed some eyepopping actual numbers to generate any sort of earnings-based movement after already seeing share price increases from releasing preliminary numbers in mid-October. I speculate that a part of the sell off was due to underwhelming year-to-date 2021 numbers. 

**DS +4.09% (+0%)** DS has already announced that they will report third quarter earnings November 8 before the market opens. Anticipation appears to be building, as the stock has added more than 10% over the last week. November 19 expiry has far and away the most options in the open interest, with 59% of them call options. Total open interest only mildly skews towards calls, however, today's trading volumes heavily favored calls over puts more than 250-to-1. Most of this action can be attributed to sweeps and algorithmic trading for the most far-dated call options in January 2023 and 2024.

**KALA +18.89% (+3.27%)** I went a genuine search for the reason for KALA's share price increase today, instead of the usual lazy Google search. At first glance, nothing special - relatively low float (just over 42 million) that's kind short (just over 20%), according to Finviz. There appears to be a lot of ""Top 5 Penny Stocks to Blow"" sort of articles that mention KALA, so it's possible that the high short %, coupled with above average volume drove the price up today. 

**UONEK -37.6% (+8.95%)** UONEK wants to build a casino and hotel in Richmond, Virginia. The stock cratered today as it appeared voters rejected UONEK's proposal. The casino referendum is *technically* too close to call, as provisional and mail-in ballots have yet to be counted, but currently the casino was rejected by Richmond voters by a 3% margin. 

**CALA -1.54% (+0.54%)** CALA has already announced that they will report earnings on November 9. There must have been something about the March $5 call that caught the algo attention, as without the volume from that particular strike, it's a relatively average day for CALA, option-wise. Open interest skews heavily toward calls, however because the lowest strike available is at $2.50, I don't think you can look at it as anything more than speculative bets. 

**LQDA +10.2% (+1.85%)** LQDA has been on quite the run, having gained 60% in the last month. The company today announced third quarter financial results. EPS came in lower than expectations, however, revenue squeaked by analyst expectations. Option traders appeared to be positioned for the stock to rise after earnings. 

**CSPR +6.25% (+0.74%)** Casper today announced that they will release their Q3 financial results after the market closes on November 15. Option volumes and open interest are absolutely dominated by call options, perhaps more than any other stock on this list today. Today there were 2,949 call options traded compared to TWO puts. TWO. However, it should be noted that since going public, CSPR earnings have a positive price effect ONCE out of 7 reports. The average price movement for CSPR shares the day of earnings is -8.6%. Who knows, though, perhaps this is the quarter. If the share price continues to increase (+10% in the last week) and option traders continue to bet that the stock will move higher, cheap lotto puts could be interesting. 

**CLNN -1.35% (+0.32%)** CLNN continued to pull back a bit a day after falling after a phase 2 trial faimed to meet its primary endpoint. 

**ATY -26.19% (+1.66%)** ATY tanked after announcing earnings that beat on EPS but missed on revenues. Oftentimes for penny stocks, I've noticed that an EPS miss isn't as big of a deal as a revenue miss is. I guess there could be an opportunity for an oversold, gap fill type of play, but me? I don't like catching falling knives. It's not that your hands could get cut, but it could fall and cut your toes. Ouch!

2021-11-01,Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 11/1,"Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 11/1 Hey gang!

Major indexes claimed new highs to open the month of November, which is historically the best month of the year for the stock market. After opening to a new high, State Street’s S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) pulled back slightly, adding 0.2% and 0.25%, respectively. Buying accelerated into the close for Invesco’s Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) setting a new high into the close as the ETF gained 0.3%. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) led major averages, as the small cap index rose 2.6%, closing in a new high.  

Ahead of a slew of economic reports at the end of the week, investors will be keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee statements on Wednesday. It is speculated that the central bank will announce that it will begin tapering its $120 billion per month in bond purchases as the U.S. economy shows growing strength coming out of both the COVID-19 pandemic and third-quarter earnings season.  

As major averages have recorded new highs, the small-cap focused IWM has appeared relatively range bound, until today. IWM broke out to the upside and is sitting on the precipice of a new high. Major averages have been driven by overall strong third-quarter earnings results, which had yet to translate to IWM. With many small-cap stocks yet to report earnings for the quarter, this could mean that investors continue to see upside growth potential for the economy.

Obligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, etc. etc. etc.

\*started the day below $5/share

Notes:

**WIMI +3.05% (+0%)** After some early profit taking, WIMI recovered to post a small gain. WIMI continues to see elevated option activity after Friday's share price increase. 

**NXTD +18.92% (+6.36%)** NXTD shares continue to be volatile in after hours trading. After opening to a loss, NXTD rocketed to a 47% gain in the last hour or so of trading before fading a bit. I speculate the gain was a bit of short covering. After seeing over 8x its average volume on Friday, NXTD saw over 14x its average volume today, with over 26 million shares traded. Like I mentioned Friday, the float is tiny (less than 4 million) and nearly 30% short, according to Finivz. 

**PROG -3.61% (-1.15%)** No news for PROG, which saw *less* than its average volume today. While PROG's chart display's a nice upward trend, is it too early to ask if the game is over for this stock with hype dying down? Retail trader attention is so difficult to hold onto...

**IDEX +6.57% (-0.47%)** No news that I could find. Did see some ""rumors"" of a $300 million order, but that's only from unsubstantiated and vague fintwit posts. 

**GNUS +0% (+0%)** Kind of a nothing-burger of a day for GNUS. Open interest and implied volatility suggest that the $1.50 call options are being sold rather than bought, which is bearish. 

**SOLO +8.45% (+1.3%)** Announced today that the company's strategic contract manufacturing partner has exercised 1.4 million warrants at CAD$4 ($3.23 USD) strike price, generating SOLO CAD$5.6 million ($4.53 million USD) cash. SOLO shares have risen 13% over the last week and 18% over the last month. 

**MNMD +5.56% (-0.75%)** Announced the its CEO will be interviewed Nov 3 on the topic ""Therapy 2.0 - The next step in mental health"" at Web Summit, in Portugal. The session will touch on MDMA dosing, psychedelic precision medicine, LSD neutralising and similar themes around the future for specialised mental health treatment. Far out, man. 

**AGEN +14.32% (+0%)** No news related to the share price increase. Earnings will be announced next week. 

**WPRT +15.5 (+0.79%)** No news. The elevated option activity could be because WPRT is set to release earnings Nov 8, and last quarter's report caused WPRT shares to jump 28%. 

**IO +30.46% (-1.56%)** I suspect this is boat loading for earnings. IO announced that it will release its third quarter results Wednesday after the market closes. The company already popped once in mid-October after announcing preliminary Q3 results, with revenue increasing 125%. Earnings could be a ""sell the news"" type event. 

**MARK -9% (-1.04%)** No news. This stock was one of the quickest hitters caught up in the DWAC-related craze. While it's encouraging that the stock has maybe found a new floor, I'm sure a *lot* of bagholders were created along the way. 

**GTE +7.91% (-1.17%)** Anticipation for GTE earnings is running rampart, as evident today's share price increase. GTE is due to release earnings today after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for tomorrow. No results have been released as of time of writing, will update if things change. 

**GSS +16.83% (-0.82%)** Announced that they agreed to a buyout in a deal expected to close in January 2022 at $3.91 per share. 

**SLGG +21.66% (+0.52%)** Today announced that they are teaming with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society for an interactive Minecraft build competition. Cool. Fuck cancer, all my homies hate cancer. 

**LOTZ +10% (+0%)** No news. The option activity could be in anticipation of earnings, which are set to be released next week. 

**BEST -18.63% (+1.53%)** Even being on the short sale restriction list, BEST continues to slide after announcing Friday it was selling its express delivery business. 

**WATT +6.25% (+0%)** No news. Earnings next week. 

**CALA +3.63% (-0.5%)** CALA shared interim safety and efficacy results from a phase 1 trial. 

**LLNW +4.36% (+0%)** No news. Earnings are expected Thursday after the market closes. 

**IFRX +11.79% (-4.43%)** No news. IFRX shares continue to be volatile. IFRX actually has the highest IV rank percentage of any stocks on this report today. 

**UAVS +2.44% (-0.34%)** No news. 

**TRVG +0% (-1.52%)** TRVG opened to a more than 12% gain and proceeded to bleed it all away after announcing  better-than-expected Q3 earnings results. It's all in euro, but TRVG beat on EPS and revenue expectations, and their CEO sees some sense of travel normality starting midway next year. 

&#x200B;

Hope everyone had a very happy Halloween. I was Hunter S. Thompson (or Raoul Duke) from Fear and Loathing, minus the copious amounts of drugs. After a ton of back and forth a business getting in the way, I *finally* have that big interview tomorrow. Wish me luck!

2021-10-28,Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 10/28,"Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 10/28 Hey gang!

Stocks continued higher amid strong third-quarter earnings reports, mixed economic data, and federal spending developments in Washington D.C. The Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) led the way higher, adding 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) rose 1%, setting a new high. The S&P 500 Index ETF (DSPY) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) gained 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively. 

Weekly first-time unemployment claims came in at 281,000, lower than the 289,000 expected. However, the advanced look at Q3 gross domestic product were lower than forecast at only 2% compare to 6.7% a quarter ago. The 2% growth was less than the expected 2.7%, as the economy continues to manage supply chain issues and the delta variant of COVID-19.

Investors were also keeping a close eye on the development of the President's $1.75 trillion social spending and climate bill. 

Earnings had been motoring along relatively smoothly - about half of the S&P 500 have reported earnings and more than 80% have beat Street estimates. Until today. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) fell 4% and 3.5% after hours, respectively. Both stocks sold off after missing key metrics. Amazon missed on *both* earnings per share and revenue, while Apple beat on EPS, but missed on revenue. This was bound to happen to at least one of the ""big boy"" stocks. I will note that historically, Apple has fallen after earnings and provided a great buying opportunity.

My bad for missing yesterday...it's been a rough/busy week. Anyway, a lot of stocks with no news again, what gives? Some I believe are institutions prepping for earnings reports. Many of the EV and clean energy stocks posted their gains late in the trading session, when more details regarding the Federal spending bill were being divulged. Basically institutions making bets on which companies will get that sweet, sweet gubment cheese.

2021-10-25,Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 10/25,"Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 10/25 Hey gang!

Stocks continue to march higher. Quite the contrast from the doom and gloom of September. This week could be make or break, as the big boy tech companies start reporting earnings. So far, so good, as Tesla (TSLA) broke both the $1,000 per share and $1 trillion market cap thresholds after rising 12%. 

The S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) climbed 0.5%, setting a new record high intraday (a record it has since broken after hours). The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) rose 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) added 0.2% for a new high, and the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) gained 1%. 

After Snapchat's (SNAP) earnings fiasco, I was wondering how the market would react to Facebook (FB) earnings, which were released after hours today. After beating on earnings per share and missing on revenue, FB is currently up more than 3% after hours. If the mega-cap tech companies rise after earnings, we could see continued record highs for stocks and indexes. Get it while the gettin' is good. 

Pretty much all asset classes are pointing bullish at the moment. SPY, as previously mentioned, is ripping. The commodities index (DBC) edges higher while the Dollar (UUP) appears to be tracking downward from a recent uptrend. A falling dollar is bullish for both commodities and stocks. Bond prices (TLT) are falling as well. During periods of economic expansion, bond prices and stocks move in opposite directions as they compete for capital. The recent pullback of bond prices could mean that investors are optimistic toward continued economic growth in the near term.  

Obligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, etc. etc. etc.

Notes:

**GNUS +51.49% (+5.42%)** An old sub favorite, GNUS broke out big after the company announced it will host a conference call on Wednesday to discuss a ""positive business development"". If this is anything like the other times this has happened with GNUS, the news will be underwhelming AF. The CEO is notorious for setting things up like this - make vague reference to something big, announce something kinda meh. Stock runs up, stock falls. Get ready for your typical ""sell the news"" event. 

**PROG +14.19% (-2.66%)** A rather fine day for PROG. Volume came in decently, with over 138 million shares traded. IV continues to remain stupid high for PROG, and it appears there could be continued gamma pressure on the stock from heavy options open interest. There are currently over 494,000 options ITM, but we've got a long way to go to next OPEX. 

**MARK +45.16% (+10.48%)** It's not often that a more than 50% gain is a disappointment. MARK was up nearly 250% in premarket trading, almost immediately slumped after multiple halts. I bought into MARK on Friday right before close at $2.09/share, and was able to get out in premarket at $7.50/share, way exceeding my target profit percentage. Why is MARK running? It's tied to the hype surrounding the former U.S. President, along with tickers DWAC and PHUN. Trump hotels getting Sharecare Health Security Verified pointed investors toward MARK, which is a partial owner of Sharecare. These plays are, unsurprisingly, volatile AF, but there's money to be made if you're swift. The volatility in these stocks is what's keeping me away from options on them actually. Everyone is hoping this is the next DWAC. 

**XELA +51.33% (+2.64%)** XELA popped after announcing the company's Digital Mailroom solution will fully enable remote employees working at home and in field offices to access data securely and quickly at one of the largest franchisors. 

**NAK +9.95% (-1.51%)** NAK rose over the $0.5 mark shortly after opening, before slowly sliding back under that key level (key at least when it comes to options). The mining company released a completed preliminary economic assessment for the Pebble project. The project can be as profitable as it wants to appear on paper, as the mine, company, and stock's future is all predicated on getting approved for the Pebble project. 

**CRTD +6.3% (+0%)** After being up over 70.% in premarket, CRTD settled for a small gain. The company today announced an NFT of the previous U.S. president. The company then proceeded to also announce a direct offering at $4.50/share, which I'm sure didn't help investor sentiment. 

**VISL +33.96% (-6.57%)** No news. VISL saw more than 50x its average volume today. 

**UAVS +8.15% (-0.68%)** UAVS actually opened to a small loss before picking up steam about halfway through the trading session. No news. 

**EBON +1.95% (+0%)** No news. 

**REDU +79.73% (-10.07%)** REDU traded flat (like the Earth!) until the last hour of trading. No news, no clue. 

**COMS +10.13% (-6.32%)** After being up more than 45% in premarket, COMS settled for a solid-yet-unspectacular gain. The company announced that it had delivered its 5G Open RAN-Compliant system to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The stock got a *lot* of attention, seeing 71x its average trading volume. 

**PIXY +42.28% (-18.29%)** PIXY was up bigly in premarket, but unlike the rest, didn't give it *all* away. The company announced the successful IPO of Industrial Human Capital (IHC), a SPAC sponsored by PIXY.

**FRSX -0.61% (-0.31%)** Announced the sale of a prototype of its four-camera vision system to a leading Japanese manufacturer of agricultural and heavy equipment testing. 

**OWLT -1.86% (+0%)** No news. 

**IZEA +2.23% (-0.83%)** Continuing today's trend, IZEA was up in premarket, the finished much lower. The company announced it has been awarded a mid six-figure contract expansion for a leading telecommunications company. The contract is for managed influencer marketing services. 

**WATT +4.23% (+0%)** No news. 

**GTE -0.46% (-0.47%)** After opening green, GTE traded in the red the rest of the way. No news, but I imagine it's hard for the energy bull run to continue with so many competing factors in the market right now. GTE saw less than its average daily share volume. 

**SEEL +0.43% (-1.69%)** The company today presented a poster on a study that they are doing at a conference. 

**KRBP +19.79% (-4.35%)** After being up more than 50% in premarket, KRBP still managed to close green, after announcing the results of a phase 1 clinical trial. 

**EQOS +21.35Z% (+20.14%)** This stock was under $5/share when I started compiling this list, and has been taking off in after hours trading. The company announced it has listed the Polkadot token on its crypto exchange. 

**ERYP -39.96% (-0.3%)** ERYP took a beating after reporting disappointed results from its Phase 3 clinical trial. Oof. Don't catch the falling knife, kids. The elevated option activity skews towards calls *however,* it appears someone opened 1,500 credit call spreads between the $5 and $7.50 strikes for April. Bearish. 

**IO +1.54% (-1.01%)** No news. 

**AQMS +1.55% (+1.02%)** No news. 

**RGS +8.68% (-1.04%)** No news. Could be momentum building ahead of earnings, which don't have a definitive release date yet. 

**TCON -4.58% (+0%)** No news, but it appears that 100% of the option activity stemmed from 1,562 credit spreads between the $5 and $7.50 strikes for June. Bearish. 

**EYEN -38.91% (+0%)** EYEN plummeted after the company announced that one of its treatments has been reclassified as a drug-device product by the FDA in a complete response letter for the company's new drug application. Is this too big of a fall and poised for a rebound? 

&#x200B;

Ehhh this is what I get for taking Friday off. A super long list haha. Let's have a good week everybody! Wish me luck, have a big interview this week.

Major indexes continued to rise on the back of relatively strong third-quarter earnings reports. The S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) led the way higher, each adding 0.8%. The Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) rose 0.4%, and the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) gained 0.5%. Both DIA and SPY currently sit less than 1% from fresh highs.

While earnings have been largely positive so far, most of the big-name companies have yet to report, and those that have are in industries that are perhaps less affected by supply chain bottlenecks, rising fuel costs, and inflationary concerns. Better-then-expected earnings could still provide downward moves if the wider market issues have more of an effect on bottom lines than forecast, or if future guidance is lowered. However, it appears markets have been resilient toward a pullback.

After a period of consolidation at the beginning of the month, it appears major averages are beginning to establish a new uptrend, perhaps forecasting a continued move to the upside for SPY and QQQ. Chart watchers will want to observe the price action in these indexes when the larger-weighted stocks begin to report earnings later this month. If traders don't sell down after earnings reports, it could suggest that the upward trend will continue through the fourth-quarter. 

Netflix (NFLX) is down 1% in after hours trading after beating on earnings per share and global paid net subscriber additions expectations. NFLX has been on quite the run, adding 20% in the last 3 months, so it will be interesting to see how investors react once the market opens tomorrow. Tesla (TSLA) gets us started with the big big boys, reporting earnings tomorrow after the closing bell. 

I'm continuing my earnings-based iron condors, taking a win today or Phillip Morris (PM). Opened positions today on Las Vegas Sands (LSV) and Comerican (CMA). I think I've mentioned this before, but my strategy here is to open iron condors with wings wider than the implied move based on the options straddle. The goal is to profit from volatility crush. I'm 6 of 7 so far, with the lone loss coming from Schwab (SCHW), which tested the upper strike of my IC. If I can develop a solid system from this, I will gladly share it.

\*started the day below $5/share

Notes:

**RDHL +13.14% (+0.73%)** No specific new for RDHL that spurred the increase. At one point RDHL was up over 21%. Investors perhaps are still reacting positively to the fact that insiders collectively purchased 180,000 shares. 

**PROG +0.33% (-1%)** It was good until it wasn't for PROG. With the massive gain that the stock had yesterday, I'm honestly surprised PROG didn't fall further. Volume was down compared to yesterday, coming in over 269 million. Glad I didn't buy back the covered call I sold yet. I think PROG will continue to be very volatile, but as far as price target I couldn't tell ya. Please, have a plan for your overall trade and plan your exit. Even if that plan is $10 per share, just have a plan. 

**WATT +9.5% (+0%)** WATT opened to a more than 30% gain, and held on to a third of that. The company received FCC approval for unlimited distance over-the-air wireless charging. SEND THE ENERGY THROUGH MY BRAIN PLS I NEED TO TWEET. Why can't I Spirit Bomb give my own energy to my phone and then just like chug a red bull to replenish? I thought this was the future. pfffft

**FTEK +22.11% (-2.16%)** I couldn't find any reason for the share price increase or increased option activity. And I googled it and everything. FTEK had 50x its average volume, with over 29 million shares changing hands today - good for more than twice the float. The option volume appears to be a combination of option sweeps and algorithmic trading, so in short - I don't know. 

**WTRH -1.37% (-0.69%)** No news that I could find. 

**NAT +6.17% (+0%)** No news. 

**ADMP -8.94% (-0.89%)** Has now given back all of the 27% gain from yesterday's open after receiving FDA approval. 

**GRTX -69.59% (-1.33%)** Today's biggest loser is GRTX, which cratered after one of their treatments sucked in trials and failed to meet its primary endpoint. Volume came in a whopping **438x** higher than normal. GRTX usually sees 69K (nice) in volume daily, but saw over 30 million today. The float is only 22 million. *Could* be oversold (just talking out of my ass I haven't confirmed this) and *could* recover a bit in the near term, but good luck catching the falling knife. Maybe just wait until it finds bottom. 

**FTFT +4.23% (+0.45%)** FTFT had one of those mid/late day sudden spikes off no news that just screams  tutes loading to me. Other than that, no news. 

**VBIV +6.98% (+0%)** No news. Most of these with no news make me wonder if share price activity is driving option activity or vice versa. 

**IO +4.13% (-044%)** After gaining more than 56% yesterday, IO opened to a 13% loss and slowly moved upwards, before getting back to green in the last hour of trading. You gotta anticipate profit taking after a huge day like yesterday. 

**ZIOP +6.1% (+0%)** No news. 

**OPTN -3.08% (+0%)** No news. Almost 100% of the option activity came from a single order for 5,000 puts at the $2.50 strike for December. I imagine this is a big long opening a position hedge, as the current open interest would not support this position as being closed. 

**TGB -1.72% (+0%)** Again no news to explain TGB's appearance in this report, which it has appeared on for 9 of the last 12 days, second only to PROG. 

**MFH +12.09% (-5.23%)** Usually when a company issues a private placement, you would expect the share price to drop. However, after doing a bit of math, the placement actually prices MFH's U.S. shares at $3.15 each, so it would make sense for the stock to rise if a private company is willing to pay a premium to the market for them. 

**AREC +6.17% (-1.55%)** Announced that it commenced engineering and planning for the restart of one of its coal mining complexes in West Virginia. Bonus: Their CEO has one of *theeeee most* CEO names every - Thomas Suave. Holy shit. 

**IFRX +14.46% (-1.08%)** IFRX was up well over 20% in premarket after being awarded a grant of up to EUR 43.7 million to support the development of one of their treatments for severely ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. The grant amount is equal to nearly one third of IFRX's market cap.

Some professional developments \*might\* have an affect on my ability to make these posts in the future. It would be unfortunate, as I really enjoy writing them, but until anything is concrete, I'll keep churning them out with my lax research, annoying personal viewpoints, and sometimes funny joke attempts.

After opening lower, major averages rebounded as earnings season continues. The S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) overcame an early deficit to add 0.3%, while the Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) rose 1%, led by gains in Tesla (TSLA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) and Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) remained flat.

Last week, major financial institutions posted relatively strong earnings across the board, setting up for a week of broader sector earnings reports. Tech heavyweights like Netflix (NFLX), TSLA, and Facebook (FB) report Tuesday, Wednesday, and Monday, respectively. Healthy tech earnings could bode well for indexes and give a glimpse into how some of the biggest names have navigated problems plaguing the market recently - namely inflationary concerns and supply chain constraints.

Bitcoin remains over the $60,000 mark on the eve of the debut of the first-ever bitcoin futures ETF. The Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) will track the bitcoin futures market, and its approval would represent a big endorsement from the SEC for crypto. 

I'm most interested in earnings reports for sectors other than finance this week. Obviously the big tech companies capture all the attention, but companies like Procter and Gamble (PG) and Honeywell (HON) give a better insight to inflation and supply chain bottlenecks than banks do. Continued big earnings beats that drive prices higher could set the market up for new highs soon. Even so, if that happens I expect it to be a bumpy road.

**PROG +39.72% (+3.68%)** Ooooh baby. After closing Friday with more than 49,000 call options in the money, PROG took off today. I imagine price action was a combination of option activity, short covering, and retail piling in. PROG saw 10x its average volume, with over 340 million shares traded today. If PROG can maintain the volume, who knows what they upside is (I surely do not). RIP my position, as I sold $3 covered calls. Oh well, it's still a gain percentage that is above my usual target profit %, so I'm happy. Depends on if my shares get called away. The stock price could tumble fast, as we've seen from many meme stock plays. Have an exit plan for your position. 

**RIG -2.49% (+0.26%)** No news for RIG. The company announced that they will announce their earnings November 1.

**DNN +12.73% (-0.54%)** No news. DNN set a new 52-week high today. 

**ADMP +8.85% (-1.63%)** After opening to a 27% gain, ADMP sent the rest of the day giving most of it back. The company announced that their opioid overdose treatment had been approved by the FDA.

**IO +56.83% (-2.29%)** IO gapped up crazy hard after announcing preliminary third-quarter financial results, with revenue increasing 125% sequentially and 175% from third quarter 2020. Pullback tomorrow?

**WTRH +2.82% (-0.68%)** After opening to a more than 17% gain, WTRH gave nearly all of it back. The company announced it had broadened its partnership with Olo Inc (OLO). A very popular stock online right now, WTRH has gained 75% in the past week. 

**MNKD -18.27% (+1.44%)** Fell after FDA would not approve its application for hypertension treatment. 

**SWN -4.89% (+0%)** No news. Opened to small gain, then proceeded to fall the rest of the day. 

**ABUS +1.47% (+0%)** No news. 

**FTEK +10.47% (+0.53%)** FTEK meandered about all day before rising more than 21% in the last hour. Then gave about half of it back. No news. 

**ZIOP -2.96% (+0%)** No news. 

**NAT +0% (-0.41%)** No news. 

**ATHX -3.1% (+0.8%)** Announced that they will announce their earnings November 15. 

**KRBP +9.14% (+0%)** No news. Looks like large scale theta gang in action, as the majority of the option activity came from 2,500 call spreads for June between the $2.50 and $7.50 strikes. 

**SELB -3.28% (+0%)** No news. 

**RCON +6.48% (+1.52%)** RCON came out the game strong and impressively didn't give back all of the gains. No news. This stock has a tiny float (<5M) that is nearly 20% short according to Finviz. 

**ADVM -1.94% (+0%)** No news. All of the volume for the most active option came from the same source mere minutes apart, so most likely the same person/entity taking a position of 3,000 puts. Could either be someone making a hugely bearish already-ITM bet, or a big long hedging their downside. 

**VYGR +10.98% (-1.76%)** No news. 

**LOV +0.72% (+0%)** No news. 

**KOS +7.35% (-0.73%)** No news. 

**TGB +3.11% (+0%)** Still no news for TGB, which has been on this list for over a week. Notably the Nov $2 call has nearly 31,000 options in the open interest. 

**MIC +0.54% (+0%)** No news. 

**ITP -0.08% (+0.42%)** No news. 

**TYME -2.54% (-0.1%)** No news. 

**AGRX +16.72% (+0.09%)** The company said that an executive bought 8.42 million shares at an average price of $0.58.

Major averages took off after a slew of large companies killed earnings. The Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) led  indexes higher, gaining 1.8% as falling bond yields boosted large-cap tech stocks. With eight members reporting earnings, the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) added 1.6%. The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) climbed 1.5% and the small-cap focused Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) rose 1.3%.

First time unemployment claims fell to the lowest level since the pandemic began, as the 239K claims reported was lower than the 315,000 expected. September's producer price index numbers came in lighter than forecast, with demand increasing 0.5%, just below the 0.6% expected. Lower inflation rates could have helped ease bond yields, spurring investors to leave safe havens and return to high growth technology stocks. 

I'm four for four (like Wendy's!) on earnings forecasts, and took some nice profits (73%) from iron condors on Citigroup today. Have been correct calling JPMorgan (bearish), Delta Airlines (bearish), Bank of America (bullish), and Citigroup (bearish). Technically Citigroup ended green today, but I'm pricing the wings of my earnings iron condors wider than the straddle's implied move. I'm also *doing my research* on expected earnings for the companies, industry, option pricing, and open interest. If you'd like to know more, feel free to message me.

Notes:

**PROG +2.45% (+1.44%)** Another wacky day for PROG. After being up in premarket trading PROG slumped out the gate, before shooting to a more than 12% gain. The stock then proceeded to give almost all of it back throughout the day. H.C. Wainwright initiated a ""buy"" rating for the stock with a $4 price target today, yet the price action remained muted on more than 92 million in volume. Open interest as of this morning shows more than 53,000 call options in the money, down from the nearly 62,000 yesterday. ITM open interest has steadily declined this week, putting any sort of OPEX gamma pressure into question. $2 appears to be the battleground and it will be interesting to see if the stock can retain this key level. 

**EDU +1.28% (+0.42%)** After opening to a 3% loss, EDU rallied mid-session to post a modest gain. Yesterday the Chinese government laid out a strategy to promote vocational education among its population, offering a lifeline for beaten private education stocks such as EDU. With big trades on either side of the option chain, it's tough to tell if investors were scalping calls on an up day, or prepping for a return to the downside with puts. 

**WTRH -18.9% (+0.97%)** A pullback was likely for WTRH, a day after rocketing more than 50% after news broke that Morgan Stanley held a 10% stake in the company. Morgan Stanley reported their earnings today and rose 2.5%, so its possible there could be more upside in the future for WTRH when one of their larger holders is doing well. Ahem, to quote yesterday's report ""With large gains like this, I nearly always expect substantial profit taking the next day, so my bet is that puts will print"". I'm not one to toot my horn a bunch, but BEEP BEEP Y'ALL. To be fair, it was a pretty easy call. 

**WTI -5.25% (-1.2%)** WTI fell for the second straight day off no news. 

**MIC -0.27% (-0.27%)** I still don't know exactly what this stock is. 

**NGL +7.78% (-0.36%)** No reason that I could find for either the price movement or elevated option activity. 

**TGB +1.85% (-1.36%)** TGB was up 5% in premarket trading, and managed to swing to the upside after briefly trading in the red. No news. Notable that there are over 32,000 call options in the open interest at the $2 strike for November. 

**MCF +0% (+0%)** MCF opened green, fell to a 2% loss, then rallied and fell again for a net zero day. Most of the option activity appears to stem from well over 1,000 calendar spreads at the $4 strike between October and November. 

**AMPE +1.8% (+1.18%)**  Was up more than 6% at one point during trading, and was up nearly 5% in after hours trading before pulling back. A lot of the option activity appears to be options being scalped, which can give the appearance of high volume. Considering that nearly all of the activity took place with options that expire tomorrow and that numerous orders were filled by algorithms, the action on this stock today was probably just some quick flips. 

**GNW +2.07% (+0%)** No news. A solid amount of the option activity came from a single order for 993 of the December $5 calls, which is slightly bullish *if* they were purchased instead of sold. 

**HMY +1.27% (-1.03%)** HMY kind of barcoded in a range today. No news, and the most active option was the same as yesterday. Hmmm. With Producer Price Index numbers coming in better than expected and bond yields falling, this could have been an inflation play closed out from yesterday. 

**SEEL -0.42% (+1.7%)** No news. SEEL was up early, then down late. 

**BWEN +25.82% (-2.89%)** Curiously no news related to the 25% gain, although BWEN saw 14x its average volume of 400K shares traded. The float is small at just under 18 million, but I'm stumped. 

**CEI -10.56% (-2.36%)** The hits keep coming for CEI. According to open interest numbers, over 132,000 call options will expire worthless this month. Once the stock started falling from its relative lofty levels, I imagine MMs were able to unwind their hedges. This continual unwind could be what is responsible for CEI's 46% loss in the last week. That and relative volume falling off, as only 118 million shares were traded today. Shorts are eating good on this one. 

**FAMI -3.66% (-1.13%)** Also continuing its fall is FAMI, although not as steep. FAMI is down 7.54% over the last week, as volume has waned. Only 85 million shares were traded today - still roughly 5x the float - but that's less than its 106 million share average. 

&#x200B;

Great day for the bulls, who knows what tomorrow brings. We do get retail sales numbers tomorrow, so we'll have an idea if inflation has pumped the brakes on consumer spending, which I doubt it has. Economists are forecasting a 0.2% decline in retail sales, but a 0.5% increase in core retail sales. The difference between the two is that automobile sales are removed from core retail sales, as they account for 20% of retail sales and could skew the numbers. 

Earnings tomorrow aren't the sexiest, with Charles Schwab (SCHW), Rio Tinti (RIO), PNC Financial (PNC), Truist Financial (TFC), and JB Hunt (JBHT) on deck. I'm most interest in JBHT and how they are affected by supply chain bottlenecks. Next week we start to see some of the big boys report, with IBM, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Verizon (VZ), Intel (INTC) and others on tap. 

The end of October is a murderer's row of mega cap stocks reporting across all sectors. Should be ample opportunity to make money. 

Ok, I gotta get back to writing option education articles for \[redacted\]. Man I wish I could tell y'all who I write for so I don't sound so full of shit. Anyways, this report will most likely be massive tomorrow with monthly OPEX and triple witching. Huzzah!

Markets remained muted as investors mulled the beginning of third-quarter earnings and parsed through statements from the FOMC. The Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) added 0.8% as the U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield (TNX) pulled back, making tech stocks more appealing for now. The S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) rose 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) remained relatively flat, while the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) added 0.4%. 

Consumer Price Index numbers came in slightly higher than expected. the change in price of goods rose 0.4% in September, as rises in food and energy prices offset declining used car pricing. CPI increased 5.4% on a year-over-year basis, the highest since January 1991. Minutes release from the Federal Reserve's September FOMC meeting showed that the central bank could begin tapering its $120 billion per month in bond purchases as soon as November.

JPMorgan (JPM), BlackRock (BLK), and Delta Airlines (DAL) kicked off earnings season for the third quarter. JPM crushed expectations, but lagged in net interest margin, which is a measure of the difference between the interest banks earn on their assets and the interest they pay out to depositors and other creditors. JPM offered no future guidance and shares fell 2.6%. BLK handily beat earnings and rose 3.7%. DAL beat earnings per share expectations by almost 100%, but fell 5.7% after warning that more expensive fuel will affect its bottom line next quarter. 

I wrote for \[redacted\] that option traders were bearish ahead of both JPM and DAL earnings. I still think earnings overall is going to be incredibly disappointing, as global and market conditions aren't great. For earnings plays, I 'm taking option positions that profit from volatility crush. There's a big run up in option trading ahead of earnings, and afterwards a ton of positions are closed, which crushes implied volatility. To take advantage of this, I've been opening put/call credit spreads, and iron condors with wings wider than straddle pricing. If you're curious about these kinds of strategies, I'm an open book.

\*included for ongoing interest/narrative purposes. Will probably halt covering these this week.

Notes:

**PROG -8.11% (+0.98%)** PROG was up nearly 10% in premarket trading after the company announced it had been granted 4 patents for various treatments, then proceeded to slide the rest of the day. Volume lagged compared to yesterday, at nearly 160 million shares. Open interest shows nearly 62,000 call options in the money, down from roughly 75,000 yesterday. IV suggests the majority of the October $2.50 and $3 calls are being sold more than bought, and the positions at the $2 strike were being closed out. This does not bode well for any sort of OPEX gamma pressure. Like I said yesterday, if the price action continues to decline, market makers will be able to unwind their hedges, placing further downward pressure on the stock. For what it's worth, Finviz lists the float at over 51% short. 

**WTRH +58.45% (-2.36%)** WTRH absolutely flew today after Morgan Stanley (MS) disclosed a 10.3% stake in the company. The stock saw more than 36x its average volume, with over 169 million shares traded today. MS conveniently reports earnings tomorrow as part of a large slate of financial stocks announcing earnings results, so its possible that poor MS earnings could send WTRH back down a bit. With large gains like this, I nearly always expect substantial profit taking the next day, so my bet is that puts will print. 

**DNN +5.56% (-0.58%)** Looks like Uranium is back on the menu, boys. Yesterday a handful of uranium stocks appeared on this list, and I guess it's DNN's time to shine. Uranium went brrrrr several weeks ago, then went dark. Regardless, DNN is up 24% in the last week alone. 

**ORPH +23.37% (+0%)** ORPH started the day meandering about a small loss until it rocketed to a 33% gain a few hours into trading. Nowhere near the insane pop it had in June, but I'm sure the longs ain't complaining. I guess there is returning retail interest for a SS, although the float is only 0.88% short according to Finviz.

**UEC +5.67% (-0.28%)** Much like DNN, UEC went brrrr a few weeks ago until it didn't. Uranium hype faded a bit, and nearly all of the uranium stocks fell off this list. UEC, after opening to a more than 2% loss, peaked at a nearly 9% gain before closing with respectable gains. For having disappeared from option trading lists, UEC still sports impressive recent gains, as the stock has gained 21% in the last week. 

**ENDP -1.2% (+0%)** What a wacky day for ENDP. The stock opened to a 4% loss, went green for a second later in the day, then finished with a modest loss. Nearly all of the option activity came in at the April expiry, with 5,500 April $6 calls being bought (at least I assume so since there was not enough in the open interest to suggest these options were being sold). There was also a notable amount of call spreads for the same month between the $6 and $5 strikes. So bullish *and* bearish activity. 

**FSM +5.62% (+0.89%)** No specific news, although FSM reported third quarter production yesterday before the market opened. A rising tide lifts all ships, as the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) rose 1.9% and State Street's Gold Trust (GLD) added 1.7%, perhaps as a result of the released FOMC minutes considering tapering in November. Consumer price index numbers also reported inflation as higher than expected, and gold and silver have historically been viewed as inflation hedges. 

**HMY +4.61% (+0%)** Pretty much the same thing as FSM. 

**IVC +2.33% (+0%)** No news. 

**TGB +2.86% (+0%)** No specific news, although TGB announced yesterday before the market opened that the company has seen a significant increase in quarterly copper production. 

**ADTX +12.71% (-0.49%)** No news that I could find, although this stock has a pretty small float (roughly 18 million shares). 

**WTI -2.67% (+0%)** WTI recovered a bit from its opening 6% loss, but still traded in the red all day. Regardless, WTI has risen more than 10% in the last week. 

**WATT +4.43% (+0.94%)** No news today for WATT, although the company yesterday announced a partnership with Wiliot, a Sensing as a Service company. WATT develops wireless charging technology, which is cool AF, but I think still a little ahead of its time. 

**SB -3.64% (+0.21%)** No news. 

**NEW +23.02% (-3.21%)** After opening to a 41% gain, NEW held on for an impressive day. No news that I could find. This is one of those beleaguered China education stocks, who seem to have random pops here and there. Will be interesting to see if this gain holds. 

**MCF -1.1% (+0%)** MCF recovered from the 6% opening loss for a marginal trading day. Most of the option activity came from 1,470 diagonal spreads between the October $4 and January 2022 $5 strikes.  

**AQMS +3.64% (+0%)** No news. The option activity and call/put disparity came from 900 put calendar spreads at the $2.50 strike between October and November. I can't imagine anyone buying these puts so close to expiration, but it would make sense to sell the near term option to open a position in the far term option for a lot cheaper than just buying the November puts outright. 

**CEI -1.39% (+1.41%)** CEI opened to a nearly 12% gain, then gave it all away and then some. It's actually net neutral with after hours trading. Volume has steadily declined, as CEI only saw 143 million shares traded today. Open interest remains strong at the $2 strike, however the downward price action is not helping. Your favorite twitter ""guru"", Zack Morris, is already several moves past this one. Look at what happened with DATS today. DATS, Atlas Trading's next hyped play after CEI, ran up 100% in a week, then dumped over 30% today. These cats will continue to front load on their followers and dump bags on them. 

**FAMI +0.78% (-0.75%)** Another down day for the internet's favorite mushroom producer. No news, the stock just saw less than average volume - *only* 84 million shares traded today. 

I feel like CEI and FAMI will continue to decline, and I will most likely stop covering them at the end of this week. 

&#x200B;

Have a good night everybody! I'll be prepping articles for publication and prepping my brain for writing this week's OPEX report. Oy. But, that means I'll be slogging away on my keyboard, so if ya got any questions, feel free to hollerrrrrrrr

Markets looked primed to resume the years-long face-ripping bull run...until they weren't. There was still some upward movement from major indexes after yesterday's losses, but sellers seemed to take hold the last hour or so of trading. Regardless, the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY), Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ), and Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) all finished up roughly 1%, give or take. 

Unfortunately for us, the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) posted marginal gains of 0.3%. IWM appeared poised to lead all indexes higher, before falling hard over a 2-hour period a few hours into trading. Many small-cap stocks took a beating today, but there's always outliers. Tech stocks regained some ground after a big selloff yesterday, with Netflix (NFLX +5.3%) leading the charge higher. 

There's still a lot of FUD in the markets, with the debt ceiling, inflation, China real estate fears, and jobs numbers all talking points. There's some big employment reports on Friday, and the market has worked itself into a quandary.

The Fed's policy has been to look toward employment numbers for a signal to being tapering bond purchases. The market right now, loves the Fed buying $120 billion in bonds every month, because it's jacked equities to the tits. Strong employment numbers are *usually* the sign of a healthy US economy, however it's possible that the employment numbers are strong and the market sells off because stronger numbers increases the likelihood of the Fed tapering their spending. See the problem here? Shit is disconnected. 

Yesterday I wrote how the S&P 500 Index (SPX) was down, but the volatility index (VIX) hadn't made a corresponding direct move upwards. I wrote ""This could mean that while SPX has recently fallen, option traders are placing bets the SPX will move to the upside"". SPY +1.04% today. Options remain priced for SPY to move higher, however that didn't stop me from opening call credit spreads today.

\*included for ongoing interest/narrative purposes

Notes:

**CEI -50.49% (-9.8%)** Holy shit! Volume came in much heavier compared to yesterday, unfortunately, it was on the sell side. Kerrisdale Capital released a short report on CEI, calling it ""a defunct oil producer that has failed to file financial statements with the SEC since Sept 2020, is in danger of having its stock delisted next month, and just fired its accounting firm in September."" OUCH. No one needed a report to know that CEI was already heavily shorted, but the stock absolutely plummeted today. As far as the financial reports, Kerrisdale is right. The most recent 10-K is for the quarter ending September 2020, which was filed in December of that year. I hadn't looked into it, as I myself have already been out of CEI before it even hit $4. 

What a crazy thing to happen literally the day after options are available. Now, I wrote recently that if a hedge fund was short at less than $1, they'd be more than happy to be short at $4. The same can be said if you believe in the investment. If you're willing to buy over $3, then current pricing should be considered a great discount. I know it doesn't help if you're swing trading. This is why I am vehemently against the whole ""not having stop losses because they can see them and will stop loss hunt"" thing. This isn't a team sport. Manage your risk. 

Speaking of managing risk, that was a very similar phrase tweeted by the biggest CEI ""bull"" on the planet, Zack Morris on twitter. Far too many people blindly follow the plays that cats like him and Will Meade call without doing any research. Morris tweeted ""Sorry guys looks like they are coordinating attacks on us...Manage your positions"". He did not provide an update on his supposed substantial position at time of writing. 

Look, you can believe this guy if you want, but in a way, he's right. Manage YOUR positions. Get your gains and fuck off to the next play. That being said, there has been an unusual track record with this guy, where positions dump HARD after he calls them and they rise on insane volume (WISH, AHT, BBIG, CEI). If you go in to the trade knowing that Morris and Meade and orgs like Atlas are more likely to dump the bag on you then not, you'll be profitable. If you try to hold to Valhalla without taking gains, or *at least* recouping your initial investment so you're playing with house money, you will continue to get burned. They've been calling DATS now for a few weeks, so if you see shills for that, they're probably holding a big 'ol bag. 

I'm sorry and legit angry for those that lost money. This is an example of market manipulation at its finest. Also part of the reason why I would never feel comfortable giving specific investment advice, because I fucking *hate* watching normal people lose money.  What use if telling someone a stock pick other than helping your position? That's why I try to take a more educational approach. I don't want you to buy what I'm holding and telling you to buy for whatever reason. I want you to learn to make your own calls. 

**FAMI -10.8% (+0.4%)** FAMI, the other current meme play, fell as well, although not as hard. I couldn't find a reason for the decline. 

**PROG -2.86% (+2.21%)** Continues to fall after announcing an offering yesterday. 

**REI +2.26% (-0.55%)** REI opened to a nearly 16% gain and proceeded to fall the rest of the day. At one point the stock was down almost 5%. The stock saw 9x average volume and touched its 52-week high today. Nearly all of the volume for the most active option, the Dec $5 call, came from a single order of 20,000. 

**GTE +19.44% (-0.83%)** Opened to a 23% gain, fell the a mere 7% gain, then rallied for a strong finish. Oil and gas continue to be strong, and GTE saw 18x the average volume today. S/O to u/NYCMarine, who has been mentioning this stock for a while without going overboard about it. Congrats homie. 

**ADTX +8.28% (-3.53%)** After opening to a 35% gain, ADTX saw some profit taking cut into the day's gain. Signed a transaction agreement to acquire AiPharma. 

**ABEV -0.36% (-0.37%)** No news. All but 1 contract of the most active option came from the same source seconds apart. 

**AMPY -0.62% (+0.93%)** Continues to see elevated option activity a day after plummeting over 40% after spilling a bunch of oil in to the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast. 

**ZIOP +6.18% (-0.53%)** Rose after it was reported that an insider traded $190K in company stock. 

**WTI +0.73% (+0%)** Opened to a 4% gain and fell to a 2% loss before closing with marginal share price movement. No news. 

**UPH -36.02% (+0.6%)** Yesterday this stock dropped almost 14% on no news that I could find. The volume yesterday leaned heavily towards puts. The company announced late last night an $40 million offering for $1.75/share. The stock closed at $2.60 yesterday. Just another example of some fuckery going on. 

**MNKD +5.11% (-0.42%)** No news. 

**GNW +4.91% (-0.25%)** No news. 

**RGS -0.32% (+3.57%)** No news. 

**SEEL+4.48% (+0.43%)** No news. 

**TBG +4.81% (+0.51%)** Announced that it has signed a $50 million revolving credit facility with the national bank of Canada. 

**LGHL +11.11% (-0.95%)** After being up more than 16% in premarket, LGHL fell early, recovered late.  No new news after yesterday's announcement. 

**MTCR +1.72% (-1.41%)** No news. Opened to a 10% loss but recovered nicely. 

&#x200B;

I'm big mad. Not even being on this play and I'm big mad. For context sake, I sold my measly 100 CEI shares at $3.02 on 9/29. 

I've said over and over that I am super risk averse. While this has kept me from larger gains, it has definitely mitigated losses and made my trading consistently win more often. However, that is what works for *me.* You gotta find what works for *you*. 

I know there's a disclaimer at the top, but I super hope no one is thinking I'm trying to chose stocks or give trading advice. I'm just analyzing data. The more I research this bonkers mechanism called the stock market, the more disillusioned I get. 

Hopefully tomorrow is a better day. Be wary of ppl who only post or comment about one stock. They have a bag they're trying to sell you.

2021-10-04,Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 10/4,"Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 10/4 Hey gang!

Major indexes fell today, erasing gains from Friday. Leading the way downward was the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ), which fell nearly 2% as tech stocks got hammered. Facebook, specifically, fell 5% after get tattled on on Sunday and having *all* of their services go down on Monday. 

Cyclical sectors and value stocks are outpacing, while tech and growth stocks are underperforming. The energy sector continues to rise amid increasing oil prices and demand. 

I've talked about the VIX, or volatility index, here before. The VIX is a measure derived from option pricing of the S&P 500 Index (SPX). One of the most popular stocks to trade is the SPX ETF, or SPY. When SPX option prices are lower because traders expect smaller SPX price changes in the future, the VIX is low, and vice verse when SPX option prices go higher. As a result, the SPX and VIX generally have an inverse relationship.

The SPX fell 4.8% in September, and while the VIX remains at a relatively elevated level, it hasn't risen in direct proportion with SPX. This could mean that while SPX has recently fallen, option traders are still placing bets that SPX will move to the upside. For historical context, SPX averages a 0.8% gain in October, and has averaged 3.9% gains in the fourth quarter (which we just started) and was up four out of every five years since World War II. 

Obligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, etc. etc. etc.

I pull my data from a premium Market Chameleon account. News I generally get from Finviz, but I also check Google. For economic reports, my go to is ForexFactory. Unusual option activity is defined as options that see at least 1.4x the average option activity by volume.

**PROG -21.79% (+0.71%)** PROG was up more than 18%, above $2, when the company announced a $20 million direct offering for 13,333,334 shares at $1.50 each. The price subsequently tanked hard. There's still potential for options to put pressure on PROG's price this month if the stock can retain high trading volumes. Still, unfortunate. 

**AMPY -43.83% (+1.55%)** AMPY stock had been on an incredibly strong uptrend since the end of September as oil prices have soared. The stock nosedived today after a large spill from an oil platform operated by a subsidiary was found off the California coast near Huntington Beach. Is this oversold and will rising oil prices drive the stock higher? Unclear, unlike the water off the coast of California (source: am from San Diego).

**DNN -4.64% (+0.69%)** After opening to a 3% gain, DNN fell the rest of the way. The whole ""uranium go brrrr"" thing quickly turned into ""uranium go turd"" and it makes me wonder if the same will happen for both natural gas and oil stocks in the near future. 

**REI +18.79% (-1.41%)** No specific news, but oil go brrrr right now. The most active option, the March $5.50 call, saw nearly all of its volume come from a single order for 10,000 of these options. Considering that the OI on this option was 362 heading into the trading session, it's safe to say this was a buy to open order, which could have helped drive the share price increase. This was either a whale who sees significant upside to REI's current price or a large institutional short hedging their risk.  Considering that Finviz shows the 69 (nice) million share float short nearly 18%, I imagine it's a big short giving themselves upside protection. 

**ENG -4.72% (+2.31%)** After opening to a nearly 14% gain, ENG faded the rest of the session. No news that I could find. Perhaps a good bit of profit taking after Friday's 19% gain. 

**ADVM +10.09% (-1.67%)** Announced new long-term data from a trial for one of their treatments. 

**OWLT -23.54% (+1.43%)** Absolutely tanked after receiving a warning letter from the FDA regarding one of their key products. The FDA sent OWLT a letter advising the company that it would be classifying the company's smart sock product as a medical device, which would require FDA approval. In the meantime, OWLT may not sell or distribute the product. OWLT recently announced 1 million babies being monitored with the smart sock, so this is a potentially huge dent to their bottom line. FDA approval would prove to be a huge catalyst, but could take a while. I'm going to keep an eye on this one as it's now in penny stock territory, has a float less than 7 million (which I'm sure is extra shorted after today) and has an average volume of 567,000. Could be potential down the road, especially if it continues to fall. I wonder if big money thinks the same thing, considering the high volume on discounted options. Also, *what the hell is a smart sock!?*

**GTE +6.7% (+0.15%)** GTE was up over 10% at one point, but held on to solid gains instead of fading. Oil prices could continue to rise and demand will only increase as the Western Hemisphere enters winter months. 

**NAT -3.47% (+0%)** Pulled back a bit after gaining more than 12% on Friday. No news. 

**AREC +14.52% (+1.88%)** AREC was up over 37% at its peak today. The company announced that it has successfully achieved a high purity of lithium, nickel and cobalt from recycled batteries sourced from the manufacturing process of electric vehicles. I think that's pretty neat, as rare earth metals are...well, rare. Being able to recycle lithium ion batteries is huge. 

**RGS -4.92% (+0%)** No news. Nearly all of the volume for the most active option, the Nov $2.50 put, came from a single order for 1,660 of these options. 

**RDHL +11.67% (-1.64%)** After being up nearly 30% in premarket trading, investors booked profit right after the open. The stock still finished up on the day after the company reported progress in a study of its Covid drug for severely ill and hospitalized patients. 

**UPH -13.86% (-0.38%)** No news that I could find for the decline. This stock has fallen 73% since its IPO in July. 

**LGHL +26% (+4.24%)** Crypto is popping off right now, as there have been a lot of arguments made as it being an inflation hedge. LGHL announced today that one of its subsidiaries has been granted a Capital Markets Service License from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This license allows the subsidiary to deal in exchange-traded derivatives contracts, OTC derivatives contracts, and spot FOREX contracts for the purposes of leveraged FOREX trading. My question is if this large gain won't give some back tomorrow. 

**KOS +1.62% (+0%)** KOS peaked at a nearly 5% gain. No news that I could find, but is most likely moving and seeing elevated option activity as a result of the whole ""oil and gas go brrrr"" thing. 

**SAN +0% (+0.27%)** Opened to a nearly 2% gain, before trading flat. Bank stocks have been doing relatively well of late, and the volume here could be speculators loading up for a future share price increase. 

**AEZS -1.3% (-2.76%)** After opening to nearly 4% gain, AEZS fell and traded relatively flat the rest of the day. No news that I could find. 

**WTI +5.66% (+0.24%)** No news. Oil and gas go brrrrr.

**CLSD -12.81% (+2.62%)** Fell after announcing multiple poster presentations at some eye meeting. This stock closed below $5/share before rising above the threshold in after hours trading, which is why I included it. 

**TECS +7.25% (+0%)** No news, but there wouldn't be for this ETF which provides triple leveraged inverse exposure to tech stocks. Tech stocks sucked today, so this ETF did well. 

**OTMO +1.63% (+0%)** OTMO was up bigly in premarket, and opened to a 42% gain, before falling and finishing with a marginal gain. The stock received a buy rating with a $10 price target before the market opened. This company is tiny, with less than 12 million shares float and an average of 142,000 in volume. 

**IO +5.07% (+0%)** Was up nearly 10% at one point. No news, but it's oil and gas related so....

**NEXT +3.56% (+0%)** No news. 

**CEI -4.92% (-3.56%)** Oooooohhhhh CEI has options! Yayyyy! It won't organically show up on the unusual options screener for a while, as it will take a while for the stock to establish its average option activity level, but I'll be covering it. CEI saw 214 million shares traded today, and like the other meme plays, if it can't sustained elevated volume, the bottom could fall out fast. For all of its attention, this stock is up less than 3% in the past week. Zoom out, though, and CEI is up more than 220% in the past month. It will be interesting to see the OI numbers tomorrow. As CEI has already kind of been right place, right time - catching popularity as oil and gas takes off - the addition of options potentially placing extra pressure is enticing. Volatility is already super high and could be fun sell cash secured puts on. 

**FAMI +2.88% (+0.93%)** Included so I don't have to read the inevitable ""wHaT aBoUt fAmI?"" comments. After opening to a nearly 14% gain, FAMI kinda durdled the rest of the day. No news. I am surprised that the stock managed to maintain gains after seeing its astronomical volume continue to decline. Thursday had well over 1 billion shares traded, Friday had over 500 million, and today had over 280 million. Thursday it went wild, Friday it fell, and today FAMI managed to hold on to modest gains.

&#x200B;

Ok that was *way* more than I wanted to write on this. I suspect that we will see several days of increased option activity with no news as institutions continue to reposition their portfolios for the new quarter. 

Ok buh byeeeeee

2021-09-18,Biotricity does it again,"Biotricity does it again Biotricity (NASDAQ: BTCY) is reforming the healthcare market as one of the fastest-growing companies in medtech. The company bridges the gap in remote cardiac monitoring, preventive and chronic care management by using the power of IoT (internet of things), wearables, and connected devices. 

Not only does the company offer real-time, comprehensive monitoring and diagnostic services for cardiac-related healthcare and comorbidities, but its devices are also built with features that can dispatch emergency care services should any anomalies or arrhythmias occur when a device is worn. 

Continuing Innovation in Medtech 

Biotricity strikes again, unveiling its new user-centric Biokit, September 14, 2021. 

Launching a suite of 3 new personal medical devices, the company prepares to expand its cardiac disease management capabilities by adding these innovative new tools to the Biotricity ecosystem. 

Unlike the doctor-prescribed Bioflux device, the Biokit is a bundled series of tools and management devices that's been designed for home-use and is comprised of: 

A digital thermometer 
A pulse oximeter 
A blood pressure cuff 
All three devices are FDA-cleared, wireless compatible and easily integrated into the Biotricity ecosystem, a platform developed for the seamless interconnectivity of monitoring devices and data management platforms. The Biokit itself was developed to address the challenges that exist with currently offered home-based medical devices. 

According to its recent announcement, this is the next step in the evolution of the Bioflux solution, where other available tools are fully integrated and will, together, act as a complete solution for at-home remote cardiac monitoring. 

'Biokit is a natural extension of our Bioflux heart-monitor, cardiac-diagnostic offering. For patients with cardiac disease, a personal medical device kit is ideal for long-term monitoring,' stated Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO and founder of BioTricity. 'After speaking with both patients and physicians, it was clear that a product like this was an immediate need.' 

The kit is currently in its final stage of production, and the company expects the new personal devices to hit consumer markets by early 2022. 

The Biokit will also expand the company's total addressable market, which now includes over 2.2 million customers served at more than 1,000 doctors offices per year. In fact, it is likely that the Biokit will actually surpass Bioflux within the healthcare market, as it reaches customers at home well before a Bioflux has actually been prescribed. 

The combination of the Bioflux and Biokit is possibly poised to break records for innovation within the healthtech and medtech markets. Biotricity will soon offer a comprehensive cardiac diagnostics product line for effective, accurate and economic long-term disease management, in addition to personal home monitoring and remote cardiac monitoring for post-diagnostic care. 

'We created the Biokit to strengthen our long-term vision of supporting diagnosed cardiac patients throughout their cardiac health journey,' Al-Siddiq explained. 'I am pleased with how quickly we have been able to develop a solution to fulfill this customer feedback, which is a testament to the team here.' 

Devices within the Biokit are able to directly integrate with other tools and platforms within the Biotricity ecosystem and include the following: 

Biokit BP: A wireless digital blood pressure cuff, enabling blood pressure data collection 
Biokit TP: A wireless digital thermometer, allowing patients to collect temperature data 
Biokit 02: A wireless digital pulse oximeter, facilitating the collection of blood-oxygen data 
These tools enable patients to track and store their data within HIPPA-compliant data management solutions. Most importantly, this data is also stored and available for interim review by physicians prior to diagnosis and during preventative follow-up visits. 

Why You Should Be Paying Attention 

The company has shown triple-digit, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year growth since its inception. This growth has led Biotricity to be self-sufficient and innovative as it grows. With an existing customer base, a well-respected footprint within the medical community and a high rate of retention, Biotricity might be well-positioned to dominate this space for years to come. 

Some people consider Biotricity to be a 'mash-up' of Doximity (NYSE: DOCS), Livongo (NASDAQ: LVGO) and Teladoc (NYSE: TDOC), but with a focus on cardiac disease and monitoring, the number one killer and one of the biggest healthcare markets..

First, I would like to shout out the folks who left kind comments yesterday. That's definitely *not* what I was going for, I was just being perhaps a little too honest and transparent. Either way, thank you, I fucking love ya.

Markets remained flat as a placid lake today, relatively. The SPX was led by the retail sector (XRT) today, as retail sales numbers came out higher than expected. Retail has been killing it, with XRT up 48% year-to-date. And it should be, since the bar was reset to a much lower level following the pandemic-induced lockdowns. 

I did not find an entry that I was comfortable with on VXX, so I'm effectively sitting this quad witching out. The market has made me real antsy in my pansty of late, so I'm opting for a good amount of dry powder on the sidelines. Scared money don't make money, tho. Ridicule away.  

Obligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, etc. etc. etc.

**BBIG +2.09% (-0.6%)** After ripping out the gate to a nearly 14% gain, BBIG squeaked out the day with a modest increase. 918K calls vs 281.6K puts in the OI. 314.2K calls, 45.9K puts, and over 102 million shares traded today. 428.2K options expire tomorrow. 26.9K calls at the $7.50 strike in the OI, which will most likely prove to be the battle ground. If the share price starts to rise, the most significant strikes for OI purposes are $900 (17.6K), $10 (30.9K), and $11 (26.8K). Huge long shots at $15 (17.7K) and $20 (41.5K). 295.1K open interest for October monthly OPEX. 

**ATER -11.47% (-7.83%)** 187K calls vs 75.9K puts in the OI. 45.9K calls, 10.3K puts, and over 14 million shares traded today. 142.5K options expire tomorrow. Nearly 13K options at the $10 strike. Might be some tough sledding for ATER, as the $12.50 and $15 strikes have high OI, but implied volatility suggests that these options are being sold more than bought. Between ATER and BBIG, it will depend on which stock gets volume. 

**DNN -4.49% (+0.59%)** Traded at $1.70 in the early report. No news. Interesting considering Sprott is going to continue its purchases. Also notable that the call/put ratio is skewing toward puts. 

**NAK +7.93% (+1.04%)** No specific news for NAK, but interesting that the share price rises on a day where gold falls. The big late day candles look like tutes loading up. 

**UEC -3.79% (+0.56%)** Traded at $3.48 in the early report. Also no news. 

**PROG +6.66% (+0.97%)** Was up nearly 12% at one point. PROG has been on this list 12 out of the last 12 days. 

**TUEM +28.32% (+3.15%)** Traded at $2.22 in the early report. Announced their interim Chief Merchant is now permanent in that post. Not sure how that translates into such bullish sentiment. However, dude *is* a 30 year industry veteran having held executive positions at Burlington, TJX, and the now defunct May Department Stores. Remember Robinsons-May, or am I just old? Is 36 old? It feels like it. 

**IO +5.33% (-3.8%)** Traded at $1.53 in the early report. Announced the company received a grant to advance port decarbonization through its climate-smart platform. Was up 34% at one point. Unfortunate that the lowest available strike is $2.50. Interesting to note that just yesterday IO was initiating a review of strategic alternatives for its business.  

**CTRM -2.64% (+/-0%)** Traded at $2.55 in the early report. After opening to a more than 7% gain, has some investors taking profit. No news. Still up 15% on the week. 

**NGL +5.61% (+2.9%)** No news that I could find, but could be benefitting from the energy sector's good week, as NGL is up 20% in that span. Looking at the option chain, it appears someone opened 500 put calendar spreads at the $2.5 put from Jan 22 to Jan 23. 

**KRBP -2.81% (+/-0%)** No news that I could find. Most active options continue to be the previously reported March bear call spreads. 

**NSPR +1.08% (+/-0%)** What a day for NSPR. Was up nearly 7% at one point, down over 1% at another point, before finishing with a marginal gain. Lots of big algo buys for next month's ATM options. 

**NM +1.71% (+/-0%)** After being down nearly 4%, rallied in the last 10 minutes of trading to finish with a gain. 

**CRVS -1.31% (+55.75%)** Traded at $2.43 in the early report. So I couldn't find any news earlier that could explain CRVS' option activity. And now the stock is going absolutely bonkers AH. Still no clue. What am I doing with my life. 

**WTI -4.52% (+0.59%)** Traded at $3.33 in the early report. No news. Most likely some profit taking today after yesterday's gain. 

**SPPI +2.64% (+0.86%)** No news that I could find. 

**GGB -4.6% (+1.41%)** The AH gain placed GGB above the $5/share threshold. No big news aside from announcing some new leadership. 

**EXK -6.87% (+1.15%)** Traded at $4.24 in the early report. Most likely dropping as gold and silver fell today. 

&#x200B;

I imagine this list will be super duper long tomorrow with monthly OPEX. Hold on to ya butts its going to get interesting!

Markets pull back yet again today, after barely pausing that slide yesterday. At one point nearly everything on my watchlist - major indexes, SPY sector ETFs, stocks I'm holding, stocks I'm watching - was red. And the green was rather moderate lol. Of the major indexes, the Russell (IWM) got hit the hardest, falling 1.27%. 

Consumer price index numbers were released today and it doesn't seem like inflation is really *slowing*. The numbers aren't overwhelming, but I feel like continued months of ""well they're not that bad"" numbers and all of sudden its like ""shit how did inflation get so high!"" 

While a lot of stocks saw losses, recent meme explosions (specifically former penny stocks with heavy gamma activity) got demolished. SPY looks like it's about to break downward out of a rising wedge, typically seen at the end of bull markets (seen on multiple fintwit feeds). Many have been crowing for a correction for a while (\*cough cough\* Burry) and I feel like they're just going to FUD it into existence.  

Obligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, etc. etc. etc.

I pull my data from a premium Market Chameleon account. News I generally get from Finviz, but I also check Google. For economic reports, my go to is ForexFactory.

\*\*included for popularity/narrative purposes

\*denotes started the day below $5/share

Notes:

**BBIG -17%** Meme stocks got *crushed* today. Part of the reason why I'm covering them. That, and they were all very recently penny stocks. 882.5K calls vs 266.7K puts in the OI. 311K calls, 66.9K puts, and nearly 69 (nice) million shares traded today. Over 430K options expire this week. 

**ATER -39%** 168.3K calls vs 66.9K puts in the OI. 268.8K calls, 112.2K puts, and nearly 104 million shares traded today. OI from this morning shows a large number of puts being sold as of EOD yesterday. OUCH! After gaining 52% yesterday, the OI nearly doubled for both calls and puts. 

**SPRT -38.22% (-6.86% AH)** Combining the trading session and AH, SPRT fell the furthest of the three former penny stocks. SPRT completed the merger with Greenridge today and saw an unholy ""sell the news"" type of event. 331.4K calls vs 563.2K puts in the OI. 231.3K calls, 220K puts, and over 48 million shares traded today. I haven't been tracking SPRT for a while, so it's interesting to see that puts dominate the OI. 

**BLU +16.53%** Traded at $5.35 in the early report. Still could find no news aside form the positive clinical results from yesterday. 

**GSAT -23.25%** Traded at $2.09 in the early report. Apple unveiled the iPhone 13 today...which does not appear to be satellite compatible. Big ""sell the news"" stuff here. 

**DNN -1.23% (+1.24% AH)** Traded at $1.62 in the early report. After being down over 6%, and up nearly 4%, DNN finished nearly net 0% for the day. No specific news that I could find. Is the Uranium run over? Maybe, maybe not as long as Sprott keeps buying physical uranium. Perhaps there is more going on with the industry that I don't know about. 

**REI -5.38% (+1.22% AH)** Traded at $2.47 in the early report. No specific news I could find. Single order for 17,500 of the most popular options.

**PROG +8.5% (+1.96% AH)** Traded at $1.08 in the early report. Announced that the US Patent Office issued a patent for assessment of preeclampsia using assays for free and dissociated placental growth factor. Whatever that means, lol. PROG has had unusual option activity 10 out of the last 12 trading days. 

**UEC -1.82%** Traded at $3.35 in the early report. Was down over 5% early and was up over 3% before fading in the last two hours of the trading session. 

**NNVC +18.67% (-3.73% AH)** Traded at $4.53 in the early report. Announced that it has completed the process of licensing the human Coronavirus field for drug development and commercialization from TheraCour Pharma. NNVC is developing oral and pediatric drugs to fight COVID-19. This stock also has a float just over 10 million and saw over 33 million in volume today. 

**KERN -4.83% (-2.86% AH)** Traded at $3.16 in the early report. Announced that they agreed to acquire 365 Cannabis, a cannabis business management software system in a $17 million deal. The acquisition is expected to close in Q4. KERN was up premarket, and opened to a nearly 10% gain before fading the rest of the way. 

**RDHL -32.66%** Dropped hard after reporting top line data from a phase 2/3 study that failed to hit its primary endpoint. Wish I could tell if the elevated call option activity was orders being closed out because of the drop, or opened for a potential rebound. 

**SPPI -4.02% (+1.4% AH)** Traded at $2.19 in the early report. Hard to find any news since all the feeds are full of class action lawsuit deadlines stemming from SPPI dropping hard on Aug 6 after getting a complete response letter from the FDA. 

**KRBP -2.54%** Traded at $3.53 in the early report. Most active option are previously covered March bear call spreads.

**MNKD +0.63% (+0.21% AH)** Was up over 6% in the middle of the trading session, before fading to a modest gain. No news that I could find. 

**REFR +3.6%** Traded at $2.35 in the early report. No news that I could find. Was up nearly 10% at one point. Most active option could be a hedge unwind or someone taking a new hedge position. 

**ABUS +/-0% (-2.35% AH)** No news that I could find. After opening to a loss, ABUS briefly rose to the green before making the largest moves AH. 

**ZIOP -10.44% (+2.45% AH)** I really couldn't find any particular reason for the price movement. 

**VINO +25.80% (-4.3% AH)** VINO rose after announcing that its shareholders had approved the purchase of additional land holdings in Argentina in an all-stock transaction. The company largely operates in Argentina. The stock has a float of less than 7 million, an average volume of 1.2 million, but today saw a volume of over 14 million. 

**SB +1.66% (+1.43% AH)** Traded at $4.90 in the early report. The company announced the election of three directors at their annual meeting of stockholders today. Was up over 3% and down over 1% at one point. the initial drop was most likely profit taking from yesterday's rise. 

**GNW -2.72%** Traded at $3.58 in the early report. Yesterday announced plans to revive an IPO for its mortgage insurance unit. 

&#x200B;

Hope your holdings did OK today! In the words of an infamous video game stonk cultural hero - hang in there.

Markets hung on for modest gains today, led by the Dow Jones (DIA). The SPY squeaked out a minor gain, ending the 5-day skid for both indexes. The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) looked like it was going to rally to finish green, but closed barely in the red. The Russell 2000 (IWM) closed green as well. Still a lot of chop in the markets and it wasn't a huge recovery. 

Consumer price index numbers are released tomorrow before the market opens. CPI numbers are probably the biggest measure of inflation. Interesting to note that producer price index (PPI) numbers on Friday did not move the markets much. So who knows. 

Don't forget, monthly OPEX, Quad Witching, oh my! Volatility will be big this week. VXX in play for me, personally.

\*\*I know they're not penny stocks. But I've been covering them recently and find them compelling. 

Notes:

**BBIG -7.34%** No news, but I don't think news is why we're paying attention to this. Short interest, blah blah blah. 864.4K calls vs 259.7K puts in the OI. 246.2K calls, 35.4K puts, and over 51 million shares traded today. Compared to recent volume, this is a relatively down day. Over 418K calls in the OI expiring this week, which is also monthly OPEX. A notable number of these options are being sold on both sides of the option chain. 

**ATER +52.37%** This thing continues to move after hours, so the price above is most likely incorrect. 140.9K calls vs 49K puts in the OI. 292.8K calls, 49.6K puts, and over 238 million shares traded today. OI showed a lot of calls being sold as of Friday. Ouch. Will be interesting to see how ATER reacts after the big gain and how the OI will reflect which options are still open tomorrow. 

**GSAT -12.31%** Traded at $2.27 in the early report. I couldn't find any specific reason for the fall. The only article I saw was a Motley Fool (ugh) article speculating that a proposed increase on capital gains taxes cause GSAT to fall. Just lazy AF speculative reporting from a hedge fund masquerading as a finance/news website. Will be interesting to see how GSAT stock performs with the iPhone 13 release tomorrow. If the rumor are true, expect moon. 

**DNN +2.52%** Traded at $1.69 in the early report. Uranium continues to go brrrr. There's a few reasons why. The Sprott Uranium ETF (which only trades OTC), began aggressively buying physical uranium since mid-July. They have 24.9 million pounds of it. The fund boosted the uranium markets liquidity and uranium production is low, helping prop up paces. The global view toward ""clean"" nuclear energy is also growing. 

**TELL +11.42%** Traded at $3.28 in the early report. Couldn't find a specific reason for the share price increase. Someone opened 13,764 calendar spreads at the $3.50 strike between September and October, which is slightly bullish. 

**REI +8.33%** Traded at $2.57 in the early report. Single order for 9,500 Oct $2.50 calls. 

**UEC +2.8%** Traded at $3.33 in the early report. Opened up more than 10% before fading throughout the day. Uranium go brrrr

**NAK -10.27%** Traded at $0.46 in the early report. The EPA basically said ""nah"" to NAK's Pebble Project, so NAK's CEO got all butthurt and released a ""react"" press release on Friday after the markets closed. In reaction, the markets sold the stock off. Without the Pebble Mine, NAK has literally nothing. 

**MILE +0.97%** Was up nearly 4% at one point. No news. Over the last 12 trading days, MILE has seen elevated option activity in 7 of them.

**BLU +21.94%** Traded at $4.89 in the early report. Huge gap up after BLU announced positive interim analysis from a phase 2 trial.

**PROG -7.83%** Traded at $1.00 in the early report. No news that I could find. 

**ABUS -2.97%** Traded at $2.24 in the early report. Was down nearly 7% at one point. 

**CTRM +12.96%** Traded at $2.40 in the early report. A reversal in shipping rates is now in effect on the Baltic Exchange Dry Index, resulting in a lift for number of dry bulk shipping companies. HC Wainwright also started handing out buy ratings for different companies. CTRM also announced new charter agreements. 

**OGI +0.41%** Opened down nearly 3% before recovering for a modest gain. No news that I could find. 

**KRBP -2.21% (+1.13% AH)** Traded at $3.64 in the early report. Someone opened over 3,000  spreads in March with the $2.50, $5.00, and $7.50 strikes. 

**SB +16.71%** Traded at $4.68 in the early report. I covered what happened with the dry bulk shipping industry above in CTRM. SB was the beneficiary of an HC Wainwright price target of $6.50. 

**REFR -22.92%** Traded at $2.25 in the early report. Still couldn't find a reason for the big drop. 

**XERS -1.87%** Opened to a 3% loss, rose to a more than 3% gain, before closing down. No news. 

**HEPA +1.2%**  Rising after announcing that additional data from a phase 2 trial ""further strengthens clinical profile"". 

**AKBA +1.39%** Was up nearly 4% at one point. Could find no news. 

**TECS -0.47%** Traded at $4.23 in the early report. This stock is a 3x inverse leveraged ETF with exposure to large-cap tech companies. Has 21.57% exposure to Apple and 20.48% exposure to Microsoft. For reference, the S&P 500 Technology Sector index (XLK) has 22.6% Apple and 20.94% Microsoft exposure. If you don't want to short the SPY, XLK, or QQQ, this is an interesting cheap alternative. There were a lot of large algo orders from multiple exchanges scooping up these options for the $5.50 strike at the end of October. I track this index so I'm familiar with it. It's not usually even as high as it was today. So someone/s are taking these kind of lottery ticket bets that tech will plunge by the end of next month. Most of these options were bought for $0.20/contract. If tech falls, there's a good shot the market as a whole isn't going to be doing well. 

**CPG +14.12%** Announced a dividend increase of $0.03 CAD/share per quarter. Options would be betting on continued share price increase, since owning options doesn't provide access to dividends.

Hope you had a good weekend and hope you have a profitable week!

2021-09-10,EOD Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 9/10,"EOD Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 9/10 Hey gang!

Ooooh is the September swoon true? Markets pulled back *again* today, and *again* the major index facing the most pain was the Russell (IWM). Many many stocks had very similar charts for the last hour - they sucked! There was a *huge* selloff of equities across the market in the last hour of trading. This is the fifth day in the row for both the SPY and QQQ to fall. Apple had an unfavorable court ruling and slipped 3%. The VIX rose above 20. Bad juju or just a quick pause on the way back up?

PPI numbers came in a bit higher than expected. Year-over-year inflation is now at the highest level since 2011. The Fed has insisted this inflation is transitory and a part of re-building the post pandemic economy. The problem is the pandemic persists, clamping down on supply chains. 

Next week's reports include the consumer price index numbers on Tuesday, crude oil inventories on Wednesday, monthly retail sales numbers on Thursday, and of course, monthly OPEX on Friday. Oh, and this month's OPEX also happens to be the infamous Quad Witching. That means that on the same day, equity futures contracts, stock options, options contracts on equity futures, and options on equity indexes all expire on the same day. This leads to abnormally high volatility, which can be great or disastrous for options.

\*\*denotes that I'm including them so I stop getting bugged about them

Notes:

**ANY -8.9%** No news. 196.9K calls vs 36.2K puts in the OI. 70.2K calls, 7.4K puts, over 26 million shares traded today. 

**ATER +15.91%** Winner, winner, chicken dinner when it comes to the ""meme"" stocks. 138.1K calls vs 42K puts in the OI. 106.4K calls, 16.5K puts, and over 78 million shares traded today. 

**BBIG -4.34%** Was up nearly 7% at one point before fading hard in the last hour. 981K calls vs 284.3K puts in the OI. 420.4K calls, 78.9K puts, and over 82 million shares traded today. 

**CEI +16.92% (-7.24% AH)** No news. No options. I include this as my passive aggressive way of avoiding getting pestered about it. At one point was up over 26% today. 

**SOS +8.53%** Traded at $2.82 in the early report. Rose after reporting six months interim (unaudited) financial results. Net revenue $185 million, 17x revenue for the same time period last year. Operating costs also increased 17x.  Gross profit and profit margins increased. Have mined 132 BTC and 1,853 ETH as of June 30. Still operating at a net loss. Has a gang of cash on hand ($185 million). 

**GSAT +0.78%** Traded at $2.61 in the early report. No news. The wild ride continues. If the Apple speculation is true, could see a huge pop with the iPhone 13 release next week. 

**DNN +12.77%** Traded at $1.57 in the early report. The price of uranium yellowcake rose to its highest level since 2014. Long story short, demand is going up. Uranium go brrrrrrr until that changes. 

**NAK +6.52%** The company put out the press release equivalent of a react video to the EPA's decision to file a motion for...blah blah blah no Pebble Project. The CEO blasted the current president and Obama, but I would be remiss to ignore the scandal NAK got itself into with the last president where they were caught bragging about their access to him and having the governor in pocket. And yet still no Pebble Project. This company is a joke, you won't change my mind. 

**ENDP +32.86%** Traded at $2.76 in the early report. Rose after settling claims by New York over its opioid marketing, averting a possible $1 billion verdict. Settled for a cool $50 million. I've said it before and I'll stand by it - fuck this company for its participation in the opioid crisis. I've lost friends to that shit. 

**UEC +10.69%** Traded at $3.30 in the early report. Uranium go brrrrrrr

**ABUS +13.18%** Traded at $4.32 in the early report. No direct news that I could find. 

**EBON -1.65%** Traded at $2.46 in the early report. After opening to a more than 6% gain, EBON faded all day. A number of large sweeps for the most popular option. 

**MILE -4.07%** Traded at $4.17 in the early report. Was up in pre-market and then just kinda sucked all day. No news that I could find. MILE, please stop sending me mail. 

**PAYS +12.93%** Traded at $3.29 in the early report. S/O u/StockyJ122 for calling PAYS in the daily thread yesterday. 

**TTOO +23.47%** Traded at $1.04 in the early report. The company reported late yesterday that its T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel is capable of detecting the Mu and Iota covid variants. Most active option had a single order for 1,506. 

**VBIV -2.7%** Big algo orders for the most active option. Those calls are WAY out of the money, so it might be a big short hedging their position. 

**SNCR -0.82%** Traded at $2.44 in the early report. No news. Someone opened 3,390 put calendar spreads at the $2.50 strike between September and October. Sell the Sept, but the Oct. This is a bearish directional trade. Calendar spreads are probably my single favorite option strategy. 

**PROG +3.77%** No news that I could find. 

**RGS -6.26%** Traded at $4.86 in the early report. No news aside from appointing a new board member. 

**SB +1.72% (+1.45% AH)** Opened the trading session to a more than 7% gain. No news that I could find. A number of large algo orders for the most popular option. 

**REFR +21.52%** No direct news that I could find. Perhaps a sympathy play off of Facebook's smart glasses announcement? This stock saw over 13x it's normal volume, so that may explain the pop. 

**CBIO +6.16%** Traded at $4.67 in the early report. No news that I could find outside of announcing some presentations yesterday. Finally the March bear call spreads aren't the most popular option. 

**KRBP -1.63%** Traded at $3.67 in the early report. Was down over 7% at one point. No news that I could find. Looks like the previously reported March bear call spreads are seeing heavy activity. 

**TUEM +16.67%** Traded at $2.10 in the early report. Continues to dump after yesterday's earnings. Someone is big bullish, scooping up a lot of options as far out as possible. 

**GNLN +18.43%** I'm wondering how this didn't qualify for the early report. Perhaps options trades hadn't exceeded the norm at the point of the day. After closing its merger with KushCo Sept 1, analysts at Cowen reinstated an ""outperform"" rating and given a $5 price target. I don't trade by price targets, as often they are grossly overstated (AAPL, for example, currently has price targets *well* over its all time high), however the PT suggests GNLN is trading at 40% discount. 

&#x200B;

As we approach monthly OPEX, I've noticed that many of the most popular options are transitioning to October. Big money doesn't like getting bit by theta. Remember your Greeks!

Thanks again for reading and all the support. Seriously. I get stressed out all day writing professionally, so it's nice to kinda have some fun and unwind with this analysis. If it helps anyone trading that's just the cherry on top.

Markets were cruising for a good portion of the day before pulling back a bit. Really kind of a muted day for the markets as a whole, with the exception of the IWM charging nearly a full percent. That's good for our small caps! With markets stagnating and the VIX rising, tomorrow's market movement will depend on the nonfarm payroll numbers, which are released before the market opens. 

Some analysts are expecting the ending of expanded federal unemployment benefits to surge job numbers. If this month's payroll numbers disappoint, I expect next months to obliterate expectations as people will go back to work in some capacity and seasonal hiring will start picking up.

\* denotes the stock started the day below $5/share

Notes:

**BBIG -15%** Experienced the inverse of yesterday, as there wasn't enough gas to keep on the upward pressure. 781.7K calls vs 173.5K puts in the OI heading into the trading session. 407.9K calls, 50.4K puts, and over 105 million shares traded today. BBIG just opened up weekly options, which I'm sure is going to blow up several people's accounts. If you're in the play for the ""proxy"", I wouldn't go with short term options, as theta will eat you alive. OI numbers are starting to shift heavily toward September expiration. 

**RAAS +21.8%** Was trading at $5.91 in the mid-day report. No news for the cloud-based communications company from China. Interesting that with a super bullish day, the second most active option are puts. Will they print tomorrow?

**KPLT +15.8%** Was trading at $5.43 in the mid-day report. No news. Very popular stocks across social media right now. 

**NXE +10.3%** No news. Apparently uranium demand has been rising for months, according to u/Epraksemet_Nalej**.** Always interesting when a stock has elevated option activity, but one option hardly stands out from the rest. 

**MMAT +16%** In the mid-day report, MMAT was trading at $5.18. No news. 

**GSAT +11.1%** Was trading at $2.27 in the earlier report.  GSAT filed an 8-K update describing receipt of ""an additional advance payment of $37.5 million from a customer..."". The company will use the funds to repay some debt. Saw some saying ""Is this coming from Apple?"" Most likely no, as Apple isn't a customer of theirs. The Apple news was tied to the iPhone having Qualcomm chips. QCOM is a GSAT customer. 

**MILE +6.2%** Traded at $4.41 in the early report. I hate the amount of mail this company sends me. I don't want your pay-per-mile auto insurance, thx.  Big sweeps for ATM calls. 

**DNN +8.5%** Was trading at $1.36 in the early report. Again, apparently uranium is entering a super cycle. Multiple large (2,000+) orders for options at the $2 strike in both October and January 2023.

**INFI +6.4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $3.80.  Announced they will participate in Wells Fargo's Healthcare Conference and H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference, both virtually. Notable that the most activity is for October calls. 

**SWN +4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $4.88. Completed acquisition of Indigo Natural Resources and updated 2021 free cash flow guidance. 

**PROG +7.4%** Traded at $1.02 in the early report. No news that I could find. Large sweeps for LEAPS. 

**HIPO -14.7%.** Traded at $4.38 in the early report. Has fallen 60% since it's SPAC-based IPO in January. Today marks the day private investment in public equity investors are able to unload their shares as per the merger agreement. Still a lot of call traders. 

**YVR +12%** Traded at $2.12 in the early report. Has given back 4.8% AH. Signed an agreement to acquire iNDIEFLIX, an ""edutainment"" company. 

**CRVS +16.7%** No news that I could find. Half of the unusual volume came from 5,000 bear call spreads with September options - sell the $2.50 call, buy the $5 call for upside protection. 

**WTRH -7.25%** Traded at $1.33 in the early report.  Supposedly one of the most shorted penny stocks, but these rumors are unsubstantiated. Perhaps someone can dig up the ortex numbers. 

**UEC +10.94%** Traded at $2.78 in the early report. Uranium stocks getting a lot of love today. Through UEC's finviz page I did find an interesting write up about uranium stocks that cited GLJ Research raised its price target on uranium mining company Cameco. The analyst for GLJ sees massive upside for uranium spot prices. Hmm if all of these uranium stocks hopped one one analysts recommendation, will the gains hold/continue or revert back a little bit? Worthwhile to note that the article I pulled this information from was published by notorious hedge fund The Motley Fool, who very well could be short uranium. 

**HMY -4.34%** Traded at $3.47 in the early report.  Released earnings either yesterday or the day before, I can't tell (conflicting sources). Two orders each for 1,750 Jan $4 calls under the ""Stock Contingent"" condition. 

**ADTX -1.64%** Back on the list after a brief absence. No news. 

**ALZN +5.68%** Traded at $3.32 in the early report. No news that I could find. Single order for 1,061 September $5 calls. 

**AMPE +6.13%** No news driving option/price movement that I could find. 

**CBIO -1.45%** Finally some different stocks other than the March bear call spreads as the most active. No news.  

**WWR +1.29%** No news, and I don't think I've ever heard of this company before. They hold interests in a graphite project in Alabama. Formerly known as Uranium Resources, Inc, so potential Uranium sympathy play? Most popular options are pretty far out, could be a big short hedging their position. 

**CRTD -0.59% (+2% AH).** No news that I could find. 

**JG +15.12%** I couldn't find a direct reason for JG's big gain today. First time hearing about this Chinese mobile developer service provider. Always interesting when there's elevated option activity but not a single one stands out. 

**REPH -0.81%** Traded at $2.55 in the early report.  Apr ratio spreads continue to be the most active. 

If anyone has any questions about anything, by all means, don't hesitate to reach out either here or by DM. I float the DM option out there because you might think something is too embarrassing to ask about, or you're new or whatever, but please just ask someone. Knowledge is the best weapon. 

*To reiterate - I DON'T PICK THESE STOCKS. They qualify by having elevated (at least 1.4x) option activity compared to normal. I'll be more than happy to check a stock's option activity for you, but save the ""wHaT aBoUt mY sToNk iTs gOiNg mOoN!"" type comments.*

Welcome to September! Markets touched new highs before being rejected back down. The market at large seems to be waiting for Friday's nonfarm payroll numbers. Boring boomer stuff, I know. But still, if you look up one day and all your stocks are red and are wondering why? Probably some boring boomer reason.

Notes:

\- **BBIG** \- Wild ride today for BBIG. After falling after hours yesterday, BBIG rocketed to a 40% gain, topping out at $11.44 before trading was halted. After giving some of that back, the stock finished with a 15.5% share price increase on the day. 759K calls vs 141.7K puts in OI heading into the session. 778.2K calls, 95.8K puts, and over 314 million shares traded on the day. Put sellers I mentioned from yesterday must be stoked. OI (which remember, is updated once per day, before the market opens) show lots of puts being sold in September, October, and January. Nearly 100,000 Sept $20 calls traded today. Wild.  First appeared on this list on 7/12, closed that day at $4.19. 

\- **GOCO** \- Started the day under $5/share. After being up over 5% at one point, GOCO finished the day with a 3.7% gain. No news that I could find, high volume sweeps for the March $5 calls. First appeared on this list 8/12, closed that day at $4.69.

\- **SOS** \- Was up nearly 12% at one point, before closing out the day with a 5.5% rise. No news that I could see. First appeared on this list 8/6, trading at $3.07.

\- **GSAT** \- Continues to give back some of the AAPL related gains from Monday, falling 5%. First appeared on this list on 6/23, trading at $1.77. 

\- **PROG** \- In the mid-day report, PROG was trading at $0.96. Around 8AM PST, PROG had risen nearly 20%, peaking at $1.06. Alas, it wasn't to last as the stock finished with a 9.8% gain today. Has given a bit back AH. The first time PROG appeared on this list was 8/20, closing the trading day at $0.67.

\- **WPG** \- Was trading at $1.83 in the earlier report. Still yet to find any reason responsible for WPG's 14% gain today. Heavy put action on a bullish day is intriguing. WPG first appeared on this list 8/9, trading at 1.68.

\- **MILE** \- Kind of meandered all day before rising 10.5% around 11AM PST. Closed out the day with a 4.5% total gain. No news that I could find. This is MILE's first appearance on this list. 

\- **WTRH** \- Traded at $1.45 in the mid-day edition of this report. No news that I could find. %5.3% gain today. WTRH first appeared on this list 8/9, trading at $1.59. 

\- **KPLT** \- Was trading at $4.91 in the mid-day report. After being up over $5 at one point, retreated a bit to close out +0.52%. KPLT first appeared on this list 8/10, trading at $4.26. 

\- **CIG** \- In the earlier report, CIG was trading at $2.64. Again, no news, but CIG did have elevated option activity yesterday. +4.3% today.  Single order for 2,000 Dec $2.50 calls. First appeared here 8/30, trading at $2.52. 

\- **CRTD** \- Was trading at $3.25 in the earlier report. No news, +13%. CRTD first appeared on this list yesterday. 

\- **ALTO** \- Trading at $4.99 in the early report. -3.54% today.  Big algo buys and market sweeps for October calls at $7.50 and $6. First appeared on this list 8/30, trading at $4.89. 

\- **NAT** \- In the mid-day report, NAT was trading at $2.52. +6.3% today. Perhaps confident investors after it was reported that a board member was buying shares. According to my records, this is the first time NAT has appeared on this list. 

\- **BXRX** \- After being up 16.7% today, BXRX finished +12.6%. No news that I can see driving the gain or option activity. BXRX first appeared on this list 8/24, trading at $0.64.

\- **REPH** \- No news, +1.6% today. Nearly all of the option activity coming from the same ratio spreads I wrote about yesterday. Slightly bullish. REPH first appeared on this list 6/25, trading at $2.38. 

\- **CBIO** \- Was up nearly 7% around 10:30 AM PST, before finishing +5.2%. March bear call spread, which has kept CBIO on this list since 8/26, the most popular options yet again. CBIO first appeared on this list 7/23, trading at $4.31. 

\- **TOUR** \- Was trading at $1.80 in the mid-day report. No news, +4%. This is TOUR's first appearance on this list.

\- **XXII** \- The end of day numbers didn't qualify XXII for elevated option activity, but I wanted to add it in since it was in the early report, where it was trading at $3.39. Finished - 5.6%.  No news. Two orders two seconds apart from the same source for a total of 3,000 calendar spreads between Sept and Oct at the $3 strike. First appeared on this list 8/5, trading at $3.52. 

&#x200B;

I probably won't include the date & price of each stock's first appearance every day, but I do think it's interesting data. I keep a spreadsheet of each day's report, tallying how the stock did that day and how it's done since. I don't have the time to review the data as much as I'd like, and I've only been keeping track of this data since 6/23. 

If anyone has any questions about anything, by all means, don't hesitate to reach out either here or by DM. I float the DM option out there because you might think something is too embarrassing to ask about, or you're new or whatever, but please just ask someone. Knowledge is the best weapon.

Kind a muted day today - whole lotta chop out there. September is historically viewed as one of the worst months for stocks, but we have teleported to the dankest of timelines, so it'll probably bring record highs.

Notes:

\- **BBIG** \- After opening to more than 20% loss, BBIG rallied to finish with a 15% gain. I imagine a lot of option holders got shaken out of their positions. 674.8K calls vs 113K puts in the OI. Doubled the number of puts in one day. Looks like a lot of puts being sold for September at $5.50 and $7.50 - theta gang strikes again. Calls being sold for the October $7.50, $9, and $10 strikes. OI will update with the higher strikes tomorrow. Huge volume for September calls at $7.50 and up. 592K calls, 72.4K puts, and over 181 million shares traded today. Open interest numbers are still relatively even for September, October and January. 

\- **ELYS** \- Was trading at $6.27 in the mid-day report. Ran 43% today after being approved for a sports betting license in Washington D.C. Is this *too* big of a gain, and will some of it be given back tomorrow?

\- **ALTO** \- Still can't find any news or reason responsible for the increased option activity or the 4% share price increase. Was trading at $5.07 in the mid-day report. 

\- **CAPR** \- No news driving CAPR's 16% share price increase. No single option had a ton more volume than the others. 

\- **GSAT** \- In the mid-day edition of this report, GSAT was trading at $1.94. Gave back a good amount of yesterday's massive gain, finishing down 15%. Multiple reports called into question the capability of the new iPhone's satellite use. 

\- **XELA** \- Was trading at $2.54 in the mid-day report. Again, no news that I could find beyond a Wall Street Reporter ""report"" offering some quotes from the XELA CEO. The stock finished with a 12.6% gain. 

\- **KPLT** \- Earlier, I wrote that KPLT was trading at $4.82. No news, down 4.8%. 

\- **PROG** \- Has risen a few cents from the $0.83 it was trading at in the mid-day report. No news. Gained 11% on more than 4x the average volume. 

\- **EVFM** \- At mid-day, EVFM was trading at $0.92. No news that I could find for this local-to-me company driving its 13.3% share price increase. I've done a bit of research on them, and....look I'm no expert, but aren't ladies taught that it's bad when the pH of their hoohas are off? Like, isn't that how you get a yeast infection? 

\- **CIG** \- No news that I could find. CIG rose 1.2% today and was trading at $2.54 in the earlier report. One single order for 6,749 Sept $2.50 call options. 

\- **GOED** \- Lost $.02 since the mid-day report, when it was trading at $3.02. Gained 8.3% on the day after  announcing some executive leadership changes. 

\- **QLGN** \- In the mid-day report, QLGN was trading at $1.58. Finished with a 22.6% gain on the day after a business report that I still don't want to read. 

\- **EYES** \- Was trading at $3.99 in the earlier report. After being up almost 13% at one point, finished with a 4.3% increase off no news. 

\- **ATHX** \- At mid-day, ATHX was trading at $1.72. No reason could be found for the 3% gain today.  Interesting to note that usually when a stock is bullish, the most active option is the ATM call. In this instance, the most active option is the Jan 22 $1 call. 

\- **GOCO** \- Pulled back a few cents from the $4.93 it was trading at in the earlier report. Dropped 2.4% today. 

\- **WTRH** \- No news responsible for the 1.5% increase (which has since been given back AH). 

\- **CBIO** \- After being up 5.7% at one point, CBIO finished with a 2.4% gain. Notable that the March bear call spread that I've written about for several days is still near the top of option activity. 

\- **SEEL** \- No news, and lower than usual trading volume driving the 4.7% gain for SEEL. One single order came through for 3,363 November $5 call options. SEEL is one of the worst gen 1 pokemon, change my mind. 

\- **REPH** \- No news today, and the stock fell 3.2%. Interesting stuff going on in the option chain. Looks like a ratio spread using April options, which is slightly bullish. 

\- **CRTD** \- No news that I could see driving CRTD's 4.1% gain. 

\- **SRGA** \- At one point was up 13.6%, but gave little back, gaining 7.8% on the day. Always interesting when a stock has a bullish day but the most active option is puts. 

&#x200B;

Will be around the rest of the evening playing Magic and working on my blog (maybe).

\- **GSAT** \- Giving back a portion of yesterday's massive gain. Currently down nearly 18%. Bloomberg reporting that Apple is building ""limited satellite communications capability into its new phones.""

\- **XELA** \- Was meandering along until a little while ago, now up nearly 11%. No news, per se, that I could find beyond a Wall Street Reporter ""report"" offering some quotes form the XELA CEO. 

\- **KPLT** \- No news, giving back some of yesterday's gain. Currently down over 5%. 

\- **CIG** \- One single order for 6,749 Sept $2.50 call options. The stock is currently up less than one percent. 

\- **GOED** \- Has gained more than 10% after shuffling executive leadership. 

\- **EVFM** \- No news that I can see driving EVFM's nearly 18% gain. 

\- **CHS** \- Man, tough break for this company. Beats earnings/revenue expectations, returns to profitability, increases full-year guidance...and is currently down over 14%. Lots of apparel retailers are down today. Notably, someone did open 1,800 bull put spreads with September expiry - Sell the $4 put, buy the $6 put. That's a bullish trade perhaps taking advantage of elevated put premium levels right now. 

\- **PROG** \- No news, better than average stock volume, share price has risen 4.5% today. 

\- **QLGN** \- Up over 20% after a business update that I don't currently have time to get through. 

\- **ATHX** \- No news that I could find at the moment. The stock is up 3.6% today. Interesting to note that usually when a stock is bullish, the most active option is the ATM call. In this instance, the most active option is the Jan 22 $1 call. 

\- **EYES** \- No reason that I could find driving EYES' 7.5% share price increase. 

\- **GOCO** \- Down almost 1% today. No news.

Notes:

\- **BBIG** \- After being up nearly 80% at one point, topping out at $9.39/share, BBIG largely fell the rest of the day, ending up with a 33% gain. I think a lot of people were expecting another SPRT situation where it would run *really* hard, but remember, it took SPRT several weeks. 693.8K calls vs 54.6K puts in the OI this morning. Will be really interested to see what those numbers look like tomorrow. 671.4K calls, 113.5K puts, and nearly 320 million shares traded. That's nearly 14x the float of just over 23 million shares. I'm most interested in the OI numbers tomorrow, as this morning there were nearly equal amounts of open interest for September, October, and January. 

\- **KPLT** \- started the day under $5/share. Was trading at $4.70 in the mid-day version of this report. Gained more than 40% on the day with no direct catalysts. Perhaps an Affirm/Amazon deal sympathy play? Recent reports show insiders making big share buys. 

\- **GSAT** \- In the mid-day report, GSAT was trading at $2.24. Finished with an almost 65% gain, although has given back more than 10% after hours. GSAT ran because a ""respected analyst"", Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities, posited that the new iPhone will use a Qualcomm chip that would allow users to make calls and send messages using low-earth-orbit satellites. GSAT is a partner with Qualcomm, so the stock ran. This is all off speculation from one person, and I would be very interested if TF International Securities holds any stake in GSAT. Is this too big of a gain for a single rumor?

\- **EDU** \- The stock took off for a 12.5% gain after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to a $3.50 price target. Interesting that on a very bullish day that the most active option is the October $2 put. Very curious that there were two orders for these puts, 25,000 each, with the ""MultiLeg"" condition, yet I couldn't find the other side of this trade. Same thing with 2 orders for 18,750 October $2.50 calls - MultiLeg condition, but no ""other side"" of the trade in the option chain. Hmmm

\- **MMAT** \- Was trading at $4.53 in the mid-day report. No news, finished the day with a 7% gain. 

\- **GOCO** \- In the mid-day report, GOCO was trading for $4.99. Over 4% gain on the day, announced after the market closed that they have partnered with the social care network Aunt Bertha to connect GoHealth members with community-based resources to address social determinants of health. 

\- **XELA** \- Was trading at $2.40 in the mid-day report. Just after the market opened XELA peaked at $2.59, then fell the rest of the day. No news driving the unusual option or share price activity. 

\- **HOFV** \- After being up over 8% at one point, HOFV slid home to a more than 2% gain. Was trading at $3.51 in the mid-day report. No apparent news driving this. Doesn't football start soon, or something? I don't know, since the Chargers left I gave up on the NFL (they were dogshit anyways). 

\- **ALTO** \- Opened to a more than 4% loss before recovering a less than 2% loss. No news, and I don't think I've heard of this company before. 

\- **PROG** \- In the mid-day report, PROG was trading at $0.82. No news, 6% gain. Notable that there was nearly 10,000 volume for call options expiring Jan 2022. 

\- **VIEW** \- Most of the option action was at the Sept $5, Sept $7.5, October $7.5, and September $12.5 strikes. Was trading at $4.87 in the earlier report. Opened to a >2% loss and finished >5% gain. 

\- **CIG** \- Kinda the same scenario with the option chain here as with EDU. Perhaps it's an error, perhaps it's just something I've never seen before. Dec $2.50 call - 2 orders for 2,691 options each. Labeled ""MultiLeg"" but I can't find the other leg. Same thing at the September $2.50 call - 2 orders for 5,382 options each, same label, no other leg. Gotta do more research I guess to figure out what this is. No news driving CIG's activity, and the stock finished with a less than 1% gain. 

\- **XXII** \- Was trading at $3.51 in the mid-day report. I don't understand why XXII fell nearly 13% after announcing that they were entering the specialty hops market. The meat of the volume came from the September $3, $4, and $5 call strikes. 

\- **RCON** \- In the mid-day report, RCON was trading at $3.37. No news that I could find for the nearly 8% gain. I think this stock is interesting because of the teeny tiny float (under 5 million shares) that's over 20% short. 

\- **WTRH** \- Traded at $1.36 in the earlier report. Finished +/- 0% after announcing the completion of asset acquisitions of various payment processing firms. 

\- **RKDA** \- Traded at $2.41 in the mid-day report. After being up over 14% early in the trading session, RKDA ended with a 7.5% increase on no news that I could find. 

\- **AQST** \- Earlier in the day, AQST was trading at $4.60. Without any related news, AQST rose over 15% today. 

\- **PIRS** \- Notched a nearly 9% share price increase to teeter on the cusp of leaving penny land. No news. 

\- **ALZN** \- No news to go on here for a stop that recently IPOed in June. After being up over 12% at one point, finished the day with a 6.5% gain. 

\- **CBIO** \- In the early report, CBIO was trading at $4.49. Most active options continue to the March bear call spreads, which have been the most active options since last Thursday. The stock fell 4% today. 

\- **WIMI** \- In the mid-day report, WIMI was $4.23/share. Was up nearly 9% this morning, before fading for a less than 2% share price increase. 

\- **BLU** \- Two large orders came through for Oct $5 calls - one for 1,810, and one for 1,000. Both orders came well after the stock had peaked (+5%) before falling to a less than one percent gain. 

\- **REPH** \- No news, fell 1.5% today. 99% of the option volume came from someone opening just under 1,800 credit call spreads. Big bearish. 

\- **KALA** \- KALA peaked with a 10% rise around 9:30 PST, before closing out the day with a 2.7% rise. 

\- **NNA** \- Fell over 5% out the gate, and by the mid-day report, was trading at $3.62. Recovered a bit for a 2.5% gain. No news, but after a big gain on Friday, there was bound to be elevated option activity of either more positions being opened if the stock continued to run, or positions being closed out if the stock stagnated. 

\- **BBAR** \- Was trading at $ 4.37 in the mid-day report.  Most active option is most likely longs hedging their positions. However, it should be noted that even removing those 1,600 puts would leave BBAR with elevated option activity. Rose 7.5% with no news. The stock has risen 28% over the last week. 

&#x200B;

How come as soon as I'm sick there's the biggest lists of stocks back to back to back. Apologies if you were looking forward to more SPRT coverage, but it's emphatically left penny land. I'm definitely keeping my eye on it and will provide any juicy tidbits should they arise. 

Still hemming and hawing about turning this into an e-mail. Trying to figure out the best way to go about it. Added to the Option Education portion of my blog, this time about Vertical Spreads. You can find a link in my profile.

I think we'll be teeter tottering on correction for a while, which will bring significant chop to the markets. Small caps are about to get CRUSHED. With the Fed tapering spending and the big ""I"" word being tossed around, markets will continue to rotate from growth to value. Unfortunately, the majority of our pennies are growth stocks, so buckle up.

Notes:

**- SPRT** \- absolutely crucial at the end for SPRT to keep any sort of gamma pressure alive for this month’s OPEX. After falling to a nearly one percent loss, SPRT finished the day with a nearly 8% gain. The $8 call strike has the second highest OI after the $18 strike (which I imagine is being used by MMs to hedge). 196K calls vs 88.6K puts in OI. 81.3K options expire tomorrow, with nearly 110K on deck for September. Closing price finished 2.2 standard deviations above the day’s VWAP. Tomorrow should be volatile AF. No matter what the outcome is, plan your exits.

\- **SESN** \- fell an additional 15% today. Doesn't appear to be multi-leg strategies, just a whole lot of put buying, specifically in February and September. 

\- **REI** \- Fell over 10% today. One single order for 20K Dec 3.5 calls. With someone’s taking advantage of cheap options as REI has been falling, or a big short is protecting their position. 

**- MNKD** \- Fell over 2% on no news. Single order for 6000 put calendar spreads - sell the August 4.5p, buy the Sept 4.5p. It’s a directional trade, in this case, very bearish. 

**- BIOC** \- was up over 20% in premarket, after announcing new data from a study of one of their treatments. The stock sold off for the rest of the day, finishing with just over a 4% gain. 

**- GOCO** \- 5% gain on the day after a small loss yesterday. Read some rumblings online about how this has the next setup as SPRT. I haven’t done any research, so I couldn’t tell ya. Obviously hasn’t garnered the same kind of attention, perhaps someone else who is more familiar can fill us in. 

**- NYMT** \- combining the trading session and AH, NYMT moved less than one percent today. Big buying for the January 2022 $4.5 call, one order was for 9,000 of these options under the condition “Stock Contingent”, which is a type of order than is executed when specific, trader-defined conditions have been met. 

**- BRFS** \- no news and a modest 2 percent gain. Nearly all of the option volume came in at the December $5 call. Big bullish, or someone with a big short position hedging. 

**- ADMP** \- was up nearly 12% early in the trading session before fading to a less than two percent gain (then gave all of that and then some after hours). Looks like 1,000 diagonal spreads set up with the Sept $2.5 call and the March 2022 $2 call. Can be bullish or bearish depending if you sell/buy near/far. 

**- MYPS** \- No news, fell over 3%. Interesting that it looks like there were 1,500 strangles set up, which isn’t bullish or bearish, it just wants *big* movement. If they’re long this strangle, they need to rise above $6 or fall below $1.50. If they’re short the straddle, they basically want the share price to remain in that range. 

**- REPH** \- rose 10% a few days after announcing the acquisition of San Diego (yay hometown!) IRISYS. Looks like someone set up over 1,500 credit call spreads - selling the April 2022 $2.50 (and a couple hundred $5) calls and buying the $7.50 calls. Bearish trade. 

**- BDSI** \- no news, fell over 3%. There were 2,000 calendar spreads opened - sell the Aug $4c, buy the Dec $4c. Probably immediately turn around and sell the Sept $4c next week. 

**- SGBX** \- no news, fell over 4%. There were 900 calendar spreads opened with the Nov $5 and August $5 puts. Also, 700 calendar spreads opened with the February $6 and August $6 puts. Big bearish trades here .

**- ESGC** \- rose nearly 8% a day after expanding a deal with Amazon for streaming. At first I thought the option volume was geared toward calendar/diagonal spreads, but it appears this is just call buying, especially LEAPS. 

**- WWR** \- fell over 5%, no news. One single order went through for 1,000 Feb 22 $5c, which is either bullish in the near term, or a big short hedging. 

**- VIEW** \- fell over 8% today, with the market continuing to punish this stock for delaying the release of their financials. Volume is kind of all over the place, the data that stood out most to me was the 340 straddles opened for October, buying both the $7.5 call and put. With this strategy, you want the stock to do anything but stay still. Moon or bankruptcy. 

**- KDMN** \-  Went up a little, went down a little, finished +/- 0%. Announced US availability of Rezurock, a treatment for patients with Chronic Graft-Versus-Host disease - a disease I only know about because of a classic episode of Arrested Development. While calls did dominate the option volume, it does look like the biggest volumes came from December credit call spreads - sell the 7.50 calls, buy the 10 calls. This is a bearish type of trade. 

&#x200B;

I've mentioned calendar and diagonal spreads here before, but wanted to touch a little more on them. They are trades that I know for a fact that MMs and institutions use to hedge their positional risk. Predictably, a lot of these kinds of positions were opened today, and I suspect more will be opened tomorrow. So what are these trades exactly?

**Calendar Spreads** are also called horizontal spreads. They involve the simultaneous buying and selling of the same type of options at the same strike price, with different expiration dates. I'll give you an example of a trade that I currently have. 

After earnings (because calendar spreads don't like volatility), I sold the 8/20 ATVI $85 call, and bought the 11/19 ATVI $85 call. I want to capture the directional trend upwards in share price, while remaining theta neutral. Ideally (and most likely unless ATVI rips tomorrow), my 8/20 call that I sold expires worthless. I keep the premium and still have the 11/19 call. So I'll continue to sell calls against the option I own, further reducing the cost. 

A **Diagonal Spread** is similar to a calendar spread. It involves buying and selling the same type of option, with different strikes and different expirations dates. I currently don't have any of these trades open, but for example - say I bought an AAPL $200 call expiring in January and sold an AAPL $160 call expiring next week. It's the same principle as the calendar spread, just different strike prices. 

MMs and tutes use these types of trades all the time. If you're bullish on a stock and think it's going to move a different direction, consider calendar or diagonal spreads. They can reduce your initial cost basis and, with a bit of maintenance, can still be profitable even when you may be directionally wrong.

Notes:

\- **SPRT** \- 195.8K calls vs 87.3K puts in the OI. Some notable big block trades at the $4 strike for September. 70% of the days trades were dark pools, pretty much right at the VWAP (volume-weighted average price). The closing share price was -1.8 standard deviations below the day's VWAP. The overall market went bloody after the Fed minutes were released, so it's not surprise to see SPRT close the day out with a loss. If there's not huge price action to the upside tomorrow, Friday could be a bloodbath once MMs can unwind their gamma hedges for the month. This action would allow shorts to cover and re-open, which they're already doing on daily basis. The OI has already shifted toward next month, with 107K options there. I also wouldn't be surprised to see IV numbers decline ahead of monthly OPEX as MMs sell the short side of calendar spreads. 

\- **SGOC** \- Gets the star as it started the day under $5/share. This stock caught my eye intraday as I was looking for big movers than may revert closer to their averages. This stock shot up super high off no news, as it has done in the past. After gaining 67% on the day, I'm not surprised that the single most active option was puts, however with the elevated IV pushing premiums higher, it was a no go for me. 

\- **SESN** \- ugh the yo-yo continues. I'm sure day traders/scalpers have to love the volatility, but it wreaks havoc on option traders. Interesting to note that the CRL that SESN received from the FDA (that sparked the recent mass sell off) was due to SESN's filing having more than 2,000 violations, 215 classified as major, according to STAT News. I'm taking this ""reporting"" with a grain of salt, as I've never heard of this website, they're the only one reporting it, and the article is behind a paywall. 

\- **VIEW** \- was briefly up 15% after the market opened, only to finish the day with a half a percent gain, a day after tumbling because they postponed their 10-Q. 

\- **OPTT** \- after rising over 17% this morning, OPTT spent the rest of the day giving back gains, finishing up 4%, in an eerily similar sort of day to yesterday. Call buyers from yesterday hopefully took gains in the AM. 

\- **TTI** \- No news, modest loss on the day. With almost all of the option activity at the Mar 22 $2.5c strike, either someone is bullish, loading up on cheap LEAPs that are already almost ITM, *or* an institutional short is building up to protect their short position. 

\- **NXTD** \- After falling nearly 12% yesterday, NXTD posted a 6% gain today. Looks like kinda the same situation as TTI - most of the option activity at a far dated strike, so either someone is big bullish or protecting their position on the other side. 

\- **OCFT** \- hmmm I'm sensing a theme here. No news, modest loss. Almost all of the option activity at a far dated strike - in this case it's the Nov 5p. Since the option is currently out of the money, I imagine it's the flip side of TTI and NXTD, where an big-time long is protecting the downside of their investment. 

\- **ESGC** \- Popped bigly after announcing it expanded a deal with Amazon to stream its upcoming releases. The stock rose almost 28% in the trading session and is up over 17% after hours. This is bullish news, so do the good times continue to roll tomorrow, or is there a bit of a pullback? 

\- **GOCO** \- I speculated if yesterday's gain for GOCO was a dead cat bounce. For the majority of the day, I was wrong, as GOCO was up a couple percent for most of the day, before fading to a small loss.

\- **MYPS** \- I had never heard of this company until today, but I have used a few of their slot machine apps to kill time on my phone. I'm surprised they're a penny stock. Ah ok, seems they IPOed in December, and while they generate a lot of revenue, they're unprofitable. Calls loaded up is either a bullish move or tute protecting their short position. 

\- **KPTI** \- based on the volume for the Aug 7.5p compared to the OI numbers for the same option, I reason that today's volume was a closing out of that position. 

\- **PFMT** \- Fell 10% after announcing the pricing of a public offering at $3.80, which, even after the drop, is a discount to market prices. 

\- **ASMB** \- moved a few percent after announcing something about something. Looks like a ratio spread with the most active options. I would imagine that it's just a strangle, but reduces the initial cost by selling the puts that expire Friday. 

&#x200B;

Oooooooooookie dokie. I spent my trading day rolling calendar spread positions. Will be looking for new ones to enter tomorrow. I like these trades because if you give yourself enough time, you can be directionally incorrect, but still profitable. They just take a bit more management.

2021-08-13,*no position DD* SQFT - a young microcap REIT,"*no position DD* SQFT - a young microcap REIT It's been awhile since I did one of these. I'm **Boom,**  with a (long delayed) continuation of a series of DD posts for companies where I currently hold no position. No position = objective outlook. This is post 30 (or 40)-something of the series. I lost track. 

Obligatory this isn't a stock recommendation, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing data, please do you own DD, etcetera, etcetera.

Presidio Property Trust (SQFT) is a “contrarian real estate investor focused on out-of-the-mainstream properties, many in locations largely ignored by institutional investors”, [according to their website](https://presidiopt.com/about-us/). They own commercial *and* residential property - commercial in CA, CO, and ND; residential in TX, WI, IL, and FL. The residential property they buy are model homes at a discount, so even though they’re not building their own, they immediately made me think of the Bluth Company from Arrested Development. This is a relatively young stock, having only IPOed in October of 2020. 

Home prices remain elevated, so I imagine it must be a good time to be in that business, but I’m unsure about the prospects of commercial retail property in North Dakota. The one building they own locally to me is a nondescript office building in a business park-y part of town. But SQFT is based here (San Diego), so I was intrigued.

Institutional ownership is 5.9% according to [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=sqft), nonexistent according to [WhaleWisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/sqft), and 6.39% according to [Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/sqft). Of course there’s some noticeable names among the institutional holders - BlackRock, Citadel, Hrt Financial - but it’s not a murderer’s row of notorious short sellers like we see with some penny stocks. The largest reported shareholder is Wealthplan Partners, an advisor firm from Omaha with nearly $2 billion AUM. Insider transactions are mostly the granting of shares to insiders, [according to OpenInsider](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=SQFT&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&xa=1&xd=1&xg=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1). 

Notably, the most recent transactions were in mid-June, when the CEO, CFO, and Chief Accounting Officer scooped up 2,200 shares between them, and a director and senior VP collectively sold 8,000 shares. Obviously I would rather see insiders *buying* shares in higher quantities instead of selling. It does look like those transactions were related to an [exercise of over allotment option to purchase shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/presidio-property-trust-announces-full-154200720.html). 

Since they’re a young public company, there’s not much news to go back on. At least there’s not a huge red flag sticking out that I can see. So let’s dig into the most recent 10-K, reported just a few days ago. Total assets of $160M vs total liabilities of $95M. Their most valuable commodity is buildings and land, obviously. $29 million in cash/equivalents, which they should be fine with [after a June offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/presidio-property-trust-announces-10-123000307.html), which ~~seems~~ was really shittily timed as the stock gained 14% one day, 14% the next day, then they announced the offering. That’s not taking care of your investors. 

Biggest liability on the balance sheet is mortgages. Total revenue for the quarter was down from $6.1M to $4.8M, however expenses were also down and there was an increase of cash from sale of real estate. This swung SQFT into a profitable quarter with an EPS of $0.08, compared to a net loss of ($0.22) the same period a year ago. It seems like they use their cash responsibly as they have increased the amount of funds they use to pay mortgages on the properties they own. Their net cash position increased to the point where they offered a $0.10 dividend, which can be expected as a REIT. Would rather have no share dilution instead of a dinky dividend. 

The chart is not encouraging, with SQFT right in line with, yet still below, the SMA20, and well below the SMA 50 & 200. This stock sees very little volume, partly because the number of outstanding shares is 9.51 million and the float is 0.43 million, according to Finviz. Only 150 call options compared to 21 puts in the OI. This stock has definitely been on a downward trend since the offering in mid-July. It caught my eye as a microcap stock that pays a dividend, has options, and the float is less than one million shares. I know how this sub loves low float stocks, lol. 

If the housing market falls out, obviously REITs like SQFT will get burned. I wish I could have found more “bad” news about the company, as I try to be objective in these DDs. The worst was the offering at a high share price. Eh, I guess they’re young, they have plenty of time for controversy. 

&#x200B;

Well, that was rough. Like I said, it's been a while since all my time has been consumed by options writing. Might have time for one or two more of this kind of research articles before the end of the weekend, so if there's a company you'd like to see covered, let me know!

2021-07-24,Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 7/23,"Penny Stock Unusual Option Activity 7/23 Howdy y'all, I really wanted to get this done yesterday, but I was absolutely gassed from a long week of analyzing option strategies around mega-cap earnings.

Obligatory these aren't stock recommendations, this does NOT constitute financial advice - if you need that advice contact your broker, I'm just analyzing data, do your own DD, would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck, no position DD might return this weekend, etc. etc. etc.

Headed into next week, the market closed at all time highs. I personally went nearly 100% cash, because the potential of weekend news, FOMC meeting next week and a monster number of earnings next week has me hesitant. Recently, relatively solid earnings have been punished. Money flowed from the financial sector to tech, which reports next week, including 4 out of 5 FAANG stocks (Netflix already reported). Just looks at this calendar:

Monday: Tesla, Lockheed Martin

Tuesday: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Visa, UPS, Starbuck, Raytheon, 3M, AMD, GE

Wednesday: Facebook, Paypal, Pfizer, Qualcomm, Shopify

Thursday: Amazon, Mastercard

Friday: Abbvie, Exxon, Chevron

Prepare for volatility. If the market rises on Monday, I will be loading on puts.

Notes:

\- **SPRT** \- leaving SPRT in because of the popularity and it was a penny stock until very recently. Nice gain for SPRT on Friday, up almost 13% before giving back a little AH. Call options more than double puts in open interest. IV is so elevated that even deep out of the money calls are stupid expensive. I've seen a lot of people throwing out crazy numbers for stock valuations. Call option buying could be what's driving the price right now. For market makers, when they sell call options, they buy stock to hedge, remaining delta neutral via the Black-Scholes model. Or they could be long other call options. The caveat with this is with elevated volume on out-of-the-money call options, if the stock price stalls and there is no gamma pressure, market makers can unwind their hedges (sell the stock they bought to protect their ass from selling naked calls), putting further downward pressure on the share price. Premiums are crazy right now, so MMs are more than willing to sell these options. Things to keep in mind: IV crush and the potential that this merger may already be priced in. I closed my $4.5 calls for over 100% gains.

\- **EDU** \- I expect this to be the next ~~stock~~ falling knife about posted with a bunch of ""but look at what it was valued at before!"" or ""available at a huge discount!"" Well, there's a reason. The CCP is probably going to make private tutoring companies non-profi7t. In the last 3 months, this stock has lost 80% of its value. It's not trading a discount, it's going down in flames. Let it find a bottom first.

**- ATOS** \- welcome back, old friend. The set up is starting to become eerily similar to last month. MM's making a TON of money selling options on this.

\- **GOTU** \- see: EDU above.

\- **BBIG** \- hype, run up, completes acquisition aaaaaand price tumbles. Not a ton, but a bit. Keep this in mind SPRT holders.

\- RLX - being sued for securities fraud following its IPO. Chinese companies are toxic AF right now. The big put volume was either a long hedging their bet OR closing their hedged bet.

\- **CEMI** \- another gap-down day for CEMI after exploding earlier in the week. Ouch.

\- **IGC** \- are we seeing a pattern here yet? IGC was juiced to the tits on Thursday and came back to Earth on Friday. [I wrote about this company 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mh9to5/no_position_dd_igc_dont_get_burned/). This stock rocketed off news of a patent for Alzheimer's treatment with THC. The company has been claiming this product would be on shelves since 2018! Their revenue is \~$900K for fiscal 2021. Lots of red flags with this company.

\- **ACOR** \- big gap-up for ACOR on new of commercializing one of their drugs in Spain. Gap-down Monday? We will see.

\- **ADVM** \- big loss after the company announced one of they're drugs sucks in clinical trials, basically. In April the stock dropped over 60% in one day because one of they're drugs sucked in clinical trials. Will probably keep falling.

\- **XSPA** \- the ticker name always makes me imagine a spa specifically for X-Men. No news, looks like algos picking up discounted options.

**- NMTR** \- considering the $1 put is the most active, and stock price is over $1, I can infer that most likely this a long hedging their position through buying puts.

\- **WISA** \- when you fly too close to the sun, sometimes your wings melt, right Icarus? This company did investors DIRTY. After two positive days, which drove up the share price, WISA announced an offering. Way to kneecap your investors. This is one of the scummiest moves, IMO. What a gift for call sellers, though.

**- CYCN** \- gap-up on announcing that it will announce results of a clinical study soon.

**- ARDX** \- the stock price tumble continues. It seems to be slowing, but this stock still has not found bottom. Open interest continues to rise on call options, which is just goofy. High IV means people are overpaying for these options. Just wait for this to find bottom and calm down. If it has a dead cat bounce, don't rush in.

\- **CBIO** \- the company announced they screened their first patient for a study, which is necessary before starting phase 1 of trials next year. I think this news is reflected in the Dec call buying.

\- **ADTX** \- looks like credit call spreads establish for February. Bearish move

\- **IMV** \- no real news, just looks like the stock finally got a bit of volume. Maybe its the purchases brought on by a public offering that was recently offered at a 16% discount to the market. EDIT: seems that a Wells Fargo analyst set a price target of $14 (credit to u/Worried_Thylacine)

2021-07-22,Inpixon ($INPX) Back to the Office and Data Analytics,"Inpixon ($INPX) Back to the Office and Data Analytics Inpixon is a very undervalued penny stock that’s ready for a turnaround.  
   
Before we look into Inpixon’s history, let's look at its lengthy bio, which features an array of technological services:  
   
“Inpixon, together with its subsidiaries, provides big data analytics and location based products and related services worldwide. It offers Inpixon Sensor 4000, a passive RF sensor to detect signals ranging from pings to a cell tower to active wireless transmissions; Inpixon IPA Pod offers entry-level barriers to radio detection based indoor positioning; Inpixon Smart School Safety Network solution, a combination of wristbands, ID badges, gateways, and proprietary backend software for school; UWB Sensor Module helps in detection with location; Inpixon GPS 900, a personnel, vehicle, and asset tracking solution; IPA Security, a mobile security and detection product that locates devices operating within a monitored area; Inpixon MDM Connector enables two-way communication between our IPA Security platform and a third-party mobile device management system; Inpixon On-Premises Analytics security customers running systems; and Inpixon GPS Viewer, a browser-based portal used to monitor location and movements of GPS-enabled tracking devices. The company also offers data analytics solutions, such as IPA Wi-Fi, a cloud-based data analytics engine that provides visitor metrics and insights by ingesting diverse data from IoT, third-party, and proprietary sensors; IPA Video analytics to help security personnel combat crime and secure indoor locations; Inpixon Captive Portal, a splash page for their customers to accept terms and conditions before using Wi-Fi; and Shoom Products cloud based applications and analytics for the media and publishing industry. It serves shopping malls, corporate offices, healthcare facilities, government agencies, local publications, and others.”  
   
Basically, Inpixon uses software to help make public spaces and facilities work, whether that be through making our children’s schools safer, helping to enable Wi-Fi services in your local mall, or reducing crime.  As companies start bringing employees back into the office, INPX will help them ensure their office space meets the employees needs.  INPX can help the employers to in building strong, connected, and flexible workplaces.  
   
You’re wondering why INPX is trading at only $1.03 at the moment ($137M Market Cap)? The group’s history is quite poor. They have a five-year revenue growth track record of -32.60%.  That, plus negative net income of -$35.60 million, is precisely why.  
   
But things have been looking a lot sunnier for INPX lately. The past two years have seen annual revenue grow at 68% and 48%, respectively. And the past two quarters have shown sales up 137% and 51%, respectively, before falling 23% in the most recent quarter, which we believe is somewhat forgivable given COVID-related pressures.  
   
There are some other very promising financials here. Fantastic P/B ratio of 0.70 and the P/C ratio of 1.21, and the surprisingly strong balance sheet with a quick ratio of 8.60 and low debt/equity ratio of 0.04.  EPS this year is set to be 97.9%, with the Gross Margin at 71%.  
   
Over the past two months, Inpixon has announced three major contract wins, with a “global social media company,” a “multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate,” and an “international banking organization.” These deals in particular suggest to us INPX is gaining some really impressive momentum.  
   
Act now while the company is still trading at bargain prices/valuation, and before these contract wins show up in their earnings.  This may be a good entry point for investors willing to assume some risk.  
   
Keep in mind this is not a short-term play but a longer-term investment. INPX has been trading sideways for some time now and it may take a very big announcement to move the needle significantly.  But with the recent news and performance, along with the 2.11M average volume, this stock is a prime candidate to blow up for its holders.  I am targeting a price around $3.00 per share.  There is growth potential with this market.  Especially if they can keep these recent margins.",0.0,Neutral,English

Notes:

\- **ATOS** \- Welcome back to penny land ATOS! Like I have been saying all week, gamma works both ways. Like I said yesterday, if it unwinds, it will unwind fast. Which it did. All the July options had stupid high volume as people probably fled their positions like rats off a sinking ship. If the thesis for why you invested in ATOS hasn't changed, then you're probably not tripping. If you were chasing a situation or trying to ""fight shorts"", then this probably hurt for you. 

**- MMAT** \- the screener is saying the most active option was the July 16 $10 put. This has to be incorrect, as it has zero volume in the option chain, and frankly, it would be insane if it did. 

\- **SENS** \- having more volume on strikes further outside of the money on calls versus puts is a bullish signal. A lot of the put action was for Aug $2.5, $3, and $4.

**- DOYU** \- someone opened 20,000 diagonal call spreads here. Can be bullish or bearish depending on which expiry you sell and which one you buy.

\- **ENDP** \- top 4 most active options were various puts at different strikes/expirys. Maybe a bunch of ratio spreads?

**- SWN -** welcome back to penny land SWN. A bunch of put calendar spreads with the $5 strike.

\- **KDMN -** crazy day for this stock off FDA approval. All the popular options were calls for Aug/Sept, except the boatload of $2.5 puts for March 2022. Probably a long hedging their position.

\- **MNKD** \- down she goes. Someone opened 6,000 put calendar spreads.

\- **SPRT** \- is this one that's supposed to be doing a merger? Or am I thinking of BBIG? Is it both? I forget.  Big action on the Aug calls at $4.50, $5, and $5.50.

\- **YVR** \- this was part of what I wrote about YVR yesterday: "" My money is on puts printing and call buyers holding bags."" Stock dropped pretty hard today. ATM July 16 calls and puts had most volume, followed closely by the Aug $2.50 call. 

\- **SNCR** \- put calendar spread between July/Aug. 

\- **TECS -** this is the most compelling one to me, behind ATOS. This is a 3x inverse leveraged ETF with exposure to large-cap tech companies. Tech has been doing okay, even better than expected. Big banks are beating earnings and their stocks are dropping. Money is flowing into tech. I wouldn't be surprised at tech stocks dumping hard during earnings, either. 

\- **VBIV** \- No surprise the July $2.5 call had the most volume seeing as some were probably in the money. IV dropped, so probably folks selling their calls instead of exercising.

\- **QTNT** \- big algo orders for $5c in January. 

\- **APRN** \- put calendar spread between July/Aug. 

\- **MCF -** calendar call spread? Probably. 

\- **PEI** \- hedgin' that long position

\- **OSG -** call closers ITM or at least near it depending on the premium paid.

\- **NEPT** \- this thing fell like a stone today. Perhaps Aug $1 call buyers believe it was an overreaction. These calls can be head cheap, too.

\- **SGBX** \- put calendar spread over July/Aug. 

\- **ABUS** \- these calls were bought super cheap, after the morning flush.

&#x200B;

*as requested by* u/thumbgrip

 Ashford Hospitality Trust (AHT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing predominantly in upper upscale, full-service hotels. The company has their hands in very familiar hotel brands - Courtyard by Marriott, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, Marriott. AHT also has some pretty fancy-pants hotels as part of their portfolio including the W Atlanta, Ritz-Carlton Atlanta, The Melrose in D.C., among others. In a weird coincidence, I have actually stayed in one of their more unique hotels - [Le Pavillon in New Orleans](https://www.lepavillon.com/). Gorgeous, old hotel, I highly recommend it, especially since they have this super unique thing where they provide PB&J sandwiches in the lobby every night. Picture me, drunk AF after drinking all day all over New Orleans, sitting in an incredibly fancy hotel, eating a PB&J under a chandelier. Anyways.

With vaccines continuing to rollout, summer almost upon us and folks itching to travel after being cooped up, is the hotel industry poised for a surge? Yes and no. This industry lost a *ton* of money in 2020 - [the average US hotel lost $1.4M in room revenue for the year while the average large hotel lost $16.4M](https://www.costar.com/article/1744223456/rebound-of-large-hotels-in-top-us-markets-serves-as-bellwether-for-industry). Booking.com CEO Glenn Fogel [believes it will be years before travel returns to pre-pandemic levels](https://fortune.com/2021/04/05/covid-travel-industry-rebound-recovery-hotel-reservations-booking-com-ceo-glenn-fogel/). It’s way more prudent for meetings to be held remotely, so I think a lot of business travel will be gone for good. I do think travel will start to recover for the summer and will continue rolling into 2022 coming off the holiday season. 

Institutional ownership has dipped from last quarter, from 28.6% to 19.2%, [per WhaleWisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/aht). The Put/Call ratio has crept up a bit, from 3.77 to 4.31 - a lot of folks are/were betting on this thing going down. Insiders have not been selling their shares. They haven’t really been buying, either, but they are granting shares. On May 14 the Board and a couple of Directors were granted almost 2 million shares, [per OpenInsider](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=AHT&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&xa=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1). I’m sure there’s a lot that goes into corporate structure and contracts/compensation that I’ll ever know, but I suspect it has something to do with [this filing regarding a vote for the Board of Directors](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-ashford-hospitality-trust-inc-1232582-8k-2021-may-12-18759-681).

This is my favorite part, because there’s some pretty juicy drama at AHT. The company has had serious money issues, with $4B in debt, $140M is considered short term (due in no more than one year). On their most recent 10-Q, AHT reported cash and cash equivalents of $225M, and that’s *after* closing [“strategic financing” for $200M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ashford-hospitality-trust-announces-closing-214500361.html). They needed money badly, a fact that one of their largest institutional investors, Cygnus Capital, [loves to point out](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cygnus-capital-nominates-five-highly-140000761.html). There’s some merit to their statements. Cygnus attempted a board takeover, citing AHT’s abysmal management, loss of share value and the fact that in 2020, while revenues were hurting, AHT continued to pay $10M a quarter to their external advisor, Ashford Investments (AINC), a company controlled by Chairman of the Board Monty Bennett. On the recent 10-Q, under liabilities, there is a line item labeled “Due to Ashford Inc, net” with a question mark in the value column. Never seen a question mark in a dollar value column on a 10-Q or 10-K before. 

In response to Cygnus’ constant badgering of AHT’s performance and subsequent nomination of members to the board, [AHT filed a lawsuit against Cygnus and ThornTree capital claiming the takeover attempt was illegal](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1232582/000110465921005449/tm212996d7_ex99-1.htm). Upon moving to the discovery phase, Cygnus dropped their takeover attempt, partially because the way they were going about it was indeed illegal, having formed a “secret stockholder group” controlling over 20% of AHT shares. The scheme even included [Cygnus’ CEO’s mother-in-law](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1232582/000110465921026421/tm217602d1_ex99-1.htm). You can’t make this stuff up.

AHT beat on EPS and revenue estimates, [implied volatility is surging for June 18 $5 calls](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-traders-betting-big-move-115911261.html) and the share price is up 10% on the week and 52% on the month at time of writing. Mind you the stock is also down 54% on the year and 25% over the last three months. While I personally think the travel/hotel industry is going to start realizing a strong comeback, I am not confident about AHT’s financial situation or self-serving management.

2021-05-21,"*no position DD* NVOS - Canadian healthcare, eh?","*no position DD* NVOS - Canadian healthcare, eh? Sup boo! **Boom** here, with a continuation of a series of DD posts for companies where I currently hold no position. No position = objective outlook. This is post 35 of the series. 

*requested by* u/spaceforcedropout

Novo Integrated Sciences (NVOS) is a primary healthcare, medical technology and wellness company out of Bellevue, Washington. To be more specific, NVOS is a corporation that wholly owns multiple subsidiaries in both the US and Canada. The company’s revenue is generated solely through one of their Canadian subsidiaries, Novo Healthnet Limited (NHL), which provides services and products through both clinic and eldercare operations. The medical technology side, Telemedicine and Remote Patient Monitoring, is still in development. NVOS uplisted to the NASDAQ in February 2021, [after completing a 10-for-1 reverse split](https://apnews.com/press-release/business-wire/business-sports-corporate-news-north-america-mens-hockey-a892be181be641f5a428deeb7ed02683). They rocketed to almost $15 after uplisting, and have steadily declined, currently sitting at $2.20 a share in after hours trading at time of writing. 

Institutions have barely acknowledged the existence of NVOS, with only 7 funds holding a total of 110,000 shares (less than half a percent), [according to WhaleWisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/nvos-2). I guess a positive takeaway would be that at least there’s no one really shorting it? Matter of fact, no one is really doing much with it, as the average daily volume is a little over 800K. Yahoo Finance says 838K, [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVOS) says 826K, Robinhood says 2.5K, [Barchart](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/NVOS) says 286K. My point is the volume is terribly low. Like me in high school, this stock does not see a ton of action. 

The only insider trading info I found was a member of the Board scooping up 9.5K shares in February and 13K shares in April, bringing their total to 207K, [according to OpenInsider](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=NVOS&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&xa=1&xd=1&xg=1&excludeDerivRelated=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1). These numbers jive with Finviz’s reported insider ownership percent around one. [Fintel](https://fintel.io/n/us/nvos), however, paints a different picture, listing insider ownership at 153%. CEO Robert Mattacchione holds 13M shares. Various directors hold several million. As of February 19, Mattacchione’s family trust, ALMC-ASAP Holdings, [held a 54% stake in the company](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/family-trust-tied-novo-stock-soars-over-900-after-move-to-nasdaq). I’m not sure if the family trust and Mattacchione’s stake are the same. Just adding the numbers, insiders own about 70% of the company. Finviz lists the float at 5.67M. 

All of this outstanding shares/float/institutional ownership stuff does not include the recent dilution via [$8M direct offering of 2.3M shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-integrated-sciences-announces-closing-120000185.html) to “certain institutional investors.” A week after closing the offering, NVOS turned around and [fully acquired PRO-DIP](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-integrated-sciences-enters-share-120000739.html), a company that makes vitamin and natural energy supplement pouches to go in your gums. A healthy spin on baseball tobacco dip. The acquisition cost them peanuts - a little over $750K in NVOS stock. Perhaps the company is looking for additional revenue streams instead of relying completely on NHL. 

I’m having trouble finding info on why NVOS got out of the alternative energy game. From 2000 to 2017, NVOS was Turbine Truck Engine, Inc. They spent 17 years trying to develop several technologies around turbine engines and other technologies, never making any revenue. Eventually there was a board takeover, they acquired NHL and became a healthcare company. Could not find anything about what happened to the turbine engine tech on which they own patents, even after reading TTE’s final 10-K. The swerve to healthcare is kind of like a post breakup glow-up. Changed industries, uplisted to NASDAQ, actually taking in revenue. New nails, hair did. Same energy.

Second quarter earnings saw a 14.5% decrease in revenue, as less people were going to clinics due to COVID. Holding $1.7M in cash, with $3.6M in short term debt, but again, they raised $8M cash with the offering. They’re not profitable yet, reporting an net loss of $0.06 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.02 last year, again, due to COVID. The Canadian health care industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.5% for the next 5 years. However the global demand for Remote Patient Monitoring (an as-of-yet non-revenue generator for NVOS) is on the rise, [with an expected CAGR of 12.2%](https://www.canadianinsider.com/at-cagr-of-12-22-remote-patient-monitoring-market-size-is-expected-to-reach-usd-2936-38-million-by-2025-says-brandessence-market-research) for the next 5 years. But they have to get their product to market. 

The biggest hindrance that I see is the low volume. If you get in, you might have to wait a while for it to really move. If you want to get out, it might take a while to find buyers for your shares.

2021-04-28,*no position DD* LYG - knackered bank on the rebound,"*no position DD* LYG - knackered bank on the rebound What up! **Boom** here, with a continuation of a series of DD posts for companies where I currently hold no position. No position = objective outlook. This is post 31 of the series. Whew! On to 50!

 LYG is the UK’s largest digital bank and financial services group. The company operates in four segments: Retail, Wholesale, Wealth and International and Insurance. It’s a banking group. They offer bank services. Think about the services that your bank offers, LYG does about the same with banks in over 30 countries under a number of brands. Lloyds is the UKs biggest domestic bank, with 30 million customers, 65,000 employees and a history extending back 320 years. How in the heck is this a penny stock? Let’s find out.

[According to Whale Wisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/lyg), institutional ownership is teeny tiny at a paltry 1.25%. For comparison, mega US banks all sport relatively high numbers of institutional ownership - Bank of America (70.08%), JP Morgan (71.09%), Wells Fargo (69.54%). However [Fintel tells a different story](https://fintel.io/so/us/lyg), listing institutional ownership at 13.9%. I believe the difference is how these two services differentiate between institutional and insider holdings. For instance Fintel lists Oakmark International Fund as an institutional owner with over 2 billion shares, and WhaleWisdom does not list Oakmark at all, even under “Current Mutual Fund Holders” tab (to be fair, it’s still in beta). No sources between Fintel, WhaleWisdom and OpenInsider listed any insider transactions. 

Like most banks, Lloyds was crushed when the pandemic started. To make matters worse, in July 2020 [CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio announced he was leaving LYG](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lloyds-bank-ceo-ant-nio-091611883.html) in 2021. Horta-Osorio guided Lloyds through the 2008 global economic crisis, and will soon be the first non-Swiss chairman in the history of Credit Suisse. Later that month Lloyds[ announced a second quarter loss after setting aside 2.1 billion pounds](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pandemic-pushes-lloyds-bank-red-065909663.html) to cover bad loans due to the coronavirus. Lloyds finally hit bottom in September after US media reported that UK banks had allegedly moved large sums of illicit funds, [which the UK government refuted](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/britain-says-taken-robust-action-101142999.html). After [planning to close 56 banks](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/llyods-lyg-resumes-plan-close-141102987.html), Lloyds found their [new CEO in HSBC’s Charlie Nunn](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lloyds-appoints-hsbcs-charlie-nunn-102322485.html).

After weathering the worst of the pandemic, [LYG got back in the green in early 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uks-lloyds-targets-wealth-push-101111437.html), opting to permanently trim office space by 20% in the wake of the Great Work From Home Experiment. By mid-April, with vaccines rolling out and Brexit anxiety subsiding, [London started to see a “hiring boom” in the financial services industry](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hiring-boom-in-finance-as-london-job-listings-surge-230105262.html) as banks moved back into expansion mode. Along with being Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, [Lloyds plans to become a large private landlord](https://propertyindustryeye.com/lloyds-bank-plans-to-become-a-large-private-landlord/), buying and renting out retail properties. This is in addition to the new government [sponsored 95% mortgages](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/property-housing-uk-banks-launch-low-deposit-mortgages-new-scheme-everything-you-need-to-know-093712672.html), which only require 5% down, as the UK’s property boom mirrors the US. [Profits have boomed](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lloyds-bank-q1-results-profits-revenu-share-price-antonio-horta-osorio-070458719.html), surging Lloyds to a one year high at the time of writing. LYG is planning to resume dividends later this year. 

It’s hard to go under as a leading institution in your country, but outgoing CEO Horta-Osorio was able to bring Lloyds back from the brink in 2008 and into profitability in 2017. It’s certainly damaging to Lloyds’ future that Horta-Osorio is leaving, but with countries reopening around the world and playing a central figure in the UKs housing boom, I think Lloyds is undervalued. Brexit will make things a little bumpy, but Lloyds is positioned well for the future.

 PHUN “gives companies the tools they need to engage, manage, and monetize their mobile presence with solutions that touch all phases of the mobile application lifecycle,” [per their website](https://www.phunware.com/company/). They also are part of blockchain gang with Phun Token, which rewards users through value of engagement, and PhunCoin, a security token that rewards users for the value of their data.

No great shakes in the grand scheme of things, but it is nice to see Citadel completely exit their position in the company. Short float sits at 9.62%, [per finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PHUN).

PHUN is no saint, however, after a lawsuit by Uber illustrated [Phunware’s fraud against them](https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/inside-ubers-fraud-suit-against-phunware/), which led to [further legal inquiries](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigation-alert-fields-kupka-shukurov-214000633.html) that have yet to be realized.

This company seems to have some shaky morals (Uber lawsuit), but they have something a lot of penny stocks would kill for - products in the wild. It doesn’t seem like they do a ton of share dilution, but without having enough cash to cover their short debt, I think the offering was inevitable. I’m wary of stocks that end up tied to BTC - BTC stumbles and tanks a whole sector around it. The run up and hype simply could be too juicy to ignore. For myself, I’d like to see improved revenues and a cleaner balance sheet.

GSAT - Globalstar, Inc (as requested by u/theimpolitegentleman)

GSAT is “a leading provider of satellite solutions for business and individuals offering customizable Satellite Commercial IoT Solutions, connectivity for mobile and field personnel, fleet asset tracking, equipment monitoring, and enabling business efficiencies beyond cellular,” [according to their fancy dance website](https://www.globalstar.com/en-us/). This is a small SATCOM company that was *very* popular on [RHPS about a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/search?q=gsat&restrict_sr=1). The SATCOM industry is big and growing, with an [estimated value of $62B in 2019, with projected growth of 9.2% from 2020-2027](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/satellite-communication-market). Is GSAT positioned for growth within their industry? Will they be [yet another satcom to go under?](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/3-satellite-bankruptcies-in-3-months-what-happened-and-who-could-be-next-58854554) How justifiable is their current market cap of over $2B?

Institutions own 16.65%, [per WhaleWisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/gsat). 11.44% are hedge funds. To me, the most interesting figures from WhaleWisdom are the options numbers - over one million call options against 45K puts. Looking at insiders, it seems like no one is really selling, per [OpenInsider](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=GSAT&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&xa=1&xd=1&xg=1&xm=1&xx=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1). The last open market purchases look to be in 2019, with a *lot* of shares being granted to officers in the meantime. 

Looking at the history of this company already has me wary - [the original Globalstar went bankrupt in 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalstar). They had way too much debt, which they are still dealing with. Just a few days ago GSAT announced [completion of a second lien warrant exercise](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/globalstar-announces-completion-second-lien-200000577.html), with the money from that being used to pay principal outstanding on its *first* lien loan agreement. They’re paying debt with debt. They’ve been [debt loading for a while](https://www.connectivitybusiness.com/insights/globalstar-must-raise-us114m-october-part-restructuring-agreement). All anybody wants to talk about when it comes to GSAT is the[ partnership with Qualcomm](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/globalstar-band-n53-qualcomm-x65-164700490.html). Except it’s not really a partnership, per se. Qualcomm included GSAT’s n53 band in their X65 5g modem. Huge for GSAT for sure, more devices will be able to use GSAT’s spectrum. They *are* partnered with Nokia, who they worked with to develop the n53 band, [which will be deployed at the Port of Seattle](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005905/en/Globalstar-Announces-Nokia-Deployment-Over-Licensed-Band-53-at-Port-of-Seattle). 

Based on technicals, [Investing is bullish](https://www.investing.com/equities/globalstar-inc-technical) while [SwingTradeBot is ambivalent](https://swingtradebot.com/equities/GSAT). While I’m still learning TA, I’ve been focusing more of my research on [value investing methods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp), which may not be appropriate for these subs because no one actually seems to give a shit about the companies, they just want to make a quick buck. I ran GSAT’s financials through a [discounted cash flow model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and was not encouraged by the results. 

The Qualcomm and Nokia dealings should help GSAT’s commercialization, which should help them actually make money. I’d really like to see them clean up their debt, which is really the only thing keeping me from considering them undervalued.

Let me know what I missed, I am sincerely hung over.

I’ve waited for this day for a while, anticipating positive growth in EPS, strengthened balance sheet, and overall exciting news surrounding their future growth and product development. 

I first posted about this one forever ago, shares have since traded sideways hovering around 1.7-2. This is a long term play, planning to hold at least 12 months as the turnaround starts to kick in. LT PT of $18 still. My position has been steadily increased to 4K shares at $2 average cost. 

**TL;DR:** I don’t think this stock will be any cheaper than it is now, earnings Wednesday + new heavy hitter board member. I strongly believe this will exit penny land this year due to outrageous exec talent being brought in and strong infrastructure as foundation for high growth in RTD cocktails and craft segments at increasing operating leverage with a CBD infused product kicker as a wildcard growth factor if regulations allow.

2021-03-26,*no position DD* TXMD - Women's Health Innovator,"*no position DD* TXMD - Women's Health Innovator What it do? Its **Boom** here, with a continuation of a series of DD posts for companies where I currently hold no position. No position = objective outlook. 

TXMD - TherapeuticsMD, Inc (as requested by u/furretarmy)

TXMD is “an innovative pharmaceutical company exclusively committed to advancing the health of women and championing awareness of their healthcare issues,” [according to their website](https://www.therapeuticsmd.com/about.php). They have a variety of products for women’s health - the once a year [birth control ring Annovera](https://www.annovera.com/about), hot flash reducer [Bijuva](https://www.bijuva.com/discover-bijuva/), a line of [prescription prenatal vitamins](https://bocagreenmd.com/), and [Imvexxy](https://www.imvexxy.com/why-imvexxy), which treats moderate to severe painful sex after menopause. I will never have a complete understanding or empathy because I’m a dude, but I can remain sympathetic and supportive of progressing women’s health needs. Pharma is a monstrously massive market and the women’s health sector is [expected to be worth $47.8B by 2027](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-womens-health-market).

TXMD has one of the largest institutional ownership percentages of any company I have researched. [Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/txmd) says 49 percent. [Whale Wisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/txmd) says 53 percent. [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/txmd/institutional-holdings) says 41.57 percent. Fintel and Whale Wisdom provide more recent filing data, so I think the true number is in that 50% area. Either way, massive. Also massively short, at 21.63% [according to Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=txmd). But the company has [*been* short for a while](https://investorplace.com/2015/04/high-short-interest-lng-txmd-syrg/). Insiders have been increasing their holdings, with the CEO leading the way with over 20M shares owned, [according to OpenInsider](http://openinsider.com/search?q=txmd). WhaleWisdom has more recent data, with filings listing that the CEO is now down to about 18M shares.

TXMD has, like a lot of pharma companies who aren’t making money, gone through their share of offerings, the most [recent being in mid-February for $110M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/therapeuticsmd-announces-pricing-110-million-140200404.html). And why is that? That’s right, they don’t make money. Which is fine, as long as you meet or exceed revenue expectations, which TXMD accomplished 3 out of 4 quarters in 2020. They’re going to have to use some of that offering cash to pay their debt, which, [according to their CFO on their last earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/02/therapeuticsmd-inc-txmd-q4-2020-earnings-call-tran/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article),they plan on doing. CFO James D’Arecca, [who joined TXMD in June 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/therapeuticsmd-announces-appointment-james-c-105000713.html), outlined the company’s plan to pay down $50M in debt, after raising $180M in cash for the fiscal year. The company outlined a bunch of different things on that call, but when it comes down to it, their flagship product, Annovera, has a teensy market share. They have less than 16,000 prescriptions. Expect those numbers to rise as [TXMD has partnered with the largest online practice for women’s health](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200715005282/en/), Nurx. Even if the company and [analysts predict TXMD to break even in 2022](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/therapeuticsmd-inc-nasdaq-txmd-breakeven-134104892.html), they’re gonna have to pump up those rookie numbers.

For what it’s worth, one long time bullish TXMD investor, [Baron Discovery Fund](https://www.baronfunds.com/product-detail/Baron-Discovery-Fund-bdffx) (who who holds 800K shares) highlighted TXMD in a Q4 2020 investor letter. “\[TXMD\] has three FDA approved drugs, all of which are being launched. Shares were down in the fourth quarter as the COVID-19 crisis hampered the company’s early launch efforts...Because the health crisis is merely delaying the product launches, we believe shares are drastically undervalued,” [Baron said in the letter](https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/02115223/Baron-Discovery-Fund-Letter-12.31.20.pdf).

Technical indicators are bearish, an agreement shared between[ TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TXMD/technicals/), [SwingTradeBot](https://swingtradebot.com/equities/TXMD), and[ Investing](https://www.investing.com/equities/therapeuticsmd-inc-technical). 

TXMD has something a lot of penny pharmas wish they had - FDA approved products. Now it’s about getting them off the ground. Paying off their debt while increasing revenue is definitely positive movement towards profitability. 

Love ya

Chengdu Future provides business management and consulting and has already contributed revenue in the first half of 2020.

RMTI – Rockwell Medical, Inc 

Rockwell Medical is a bio pharmaceutical company which engages in the development of treatment for  anemia, kidney disease, iron deficiency, and heomodialysis. Their flagship drug is Triferic, “the first and only FDA-approved treatment indicated for the replacement of iron to maintain hemoglobin in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease,” [according to their website](https://www.rockwellmed.com/our-technology/triferic/). Dialysis...sucks. It just plain sucks. There's [plenty of side effects](https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-health/dialysis-side-effects), both [mental](https://woodstockhealingarts.com/live-dialysis-post-5-sick-sucks-doesnt/) and physical. 

There is a sizable amount of institutional ownership, just below 29% [according to Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/rmti). Looking at *who* is investing is encouraging as it's a lot of index funds and ETFs holding or increasing positions and noted short sellers such as Citadel, Susquehanna and Two Sigma among those exiting their positions. [Whale Wisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/rmti) paints an even more interesting picture, with options significantly reduced. Call options dropped \~40% from 94K to 55K but put options dropped nearly 100%! From 77K to two. Not 2K. Two.   

Since May 2020, RMTI received [FDA approval for the IV form of Triferic](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/rockwell-medical-inc-receives-fda-approval-for-triferic-avnu-ferric-pyrophosphate-citrate-intravenous-formulation-of-triferic-for-replacement-of-iron-and-maintenance-of-hemoglobin-in-hemodialysis-patients/), brought in a big swinging dick of the industry [onto the Board](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-inc-appoints-pharmaceutical-203010251.html), replaced their [president/CEO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-inc-appoints-russell-123010976.html) and [VP/CFO/CBO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-announces-appointment-russell-115900321.html) (curiously both of these guys are named Russel), got the ball rolling for Triferic in [Canada ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-inc-files-drug-110010706.html)and [South Korea](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-enters-exclusive-license-201500369.html) and [China](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-announces-dosing-first-120000967.html). They also did a [direct offering, raising themselves $35M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-announces-35-0-124500654.html), but also tanking the stock nearly 30% in one day. Over the last two quarters they beat or met earnings, even with covid reduced expectations, yet their Return on Capital Employed ([ROCE](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roce.asp)) remained low, even if they [seemed to have been using their debt responsibly](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-nasdaq-rmti-using-090709558.html). 

This is a company that has FDA approval in the last year, changed up their leadership, are trying to expand into global markets, and has seemingly been using debt to facilitate growth (they have debt, but they also have cash). Almost all of the institutional put options have disappeared as of last reporting, and the [April 16 $2 call option have seen a rise in volatility](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-traders-know-something-rockwell-123412846.html). As a side note, I am really starting to loathe these algo-written type articles, but if they want to crunch the numbers for us and spit out some info I'll take it.   

In taking an objective view, I try to see both the good *and* bad of a company so I can make my own informed decision, but with RMTI *I've had a hard time finding bad news*. In 2019, RMTI [was expected to become profitable](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-inc-nasdaq-rmti-151046508.html) by the end of 2021. Obviously that was before a global pandemic put everything on its head, but we're almost there. I'd keep an eye on their Q4 2020 and yearly earnings update which is expected March 31.   

I think all I have on deck for this series currently is CBD. If there's a stock you'd like to see covered, just let me know! Thanks for reading.

2021-03-22,*no position DD* IFMK - Homemade Mongolian Beef,"*no position DD* IFMK - Homemade Mongolian Beef Hey gang, its **Boom** here, with a continuation of a series of DD posts for companies where I currently hold no position. No position = objective outlook. 

IFMK – iFresh, Inc (as requested by u/No_Whammies_plz) 

iFresh is an Asian/Chinese grocery supermarket chain in the North-Eastern US providing food and other merchandise hard to find in mainstream grocery stores. [According to their website](https://www.ifreshmarket.com/en/about/), IFMK “shoulders the heavy responsibility of promoting and spreading the Chinese food culture” with a presence in New York, Boston, Florida, and Maryland. They have nine retail supermarkets (with 3 additional stores opening soon) and two in-house wholesale businesses strategically located in cities with a highly concentrated Asian population. Basically an Asian/Chinese grocery store chain that is expanding into online delivery with their own proprietary in-house network. 

[Fintel's showing](https://fintel.io/so/us/ifmk) a little over one percent institutional ownership, so nothing special there. Insider ownership sits at 20%, with the last recorded sales of shares being 2019 with [Board member Jay Walder](http://investors.ifreshmarket.com/corporate-governance/board-of-directors) completely exiting his position in the company, [per Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/search?q=ifmk). Seems like the CEO picked up 6M more shares, but it wasn't an open market purchase.   

IFMK was trading around the two dollar mark in 2019 until November, then it fell off a cliff, plunging 56% alone on Nov 4, 2019 after news broke that a planned acquisition target was [under investigation for allegedly conducting illegal fundraising from the public.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ifresh-inc-receives-news-respect-144422386.html) IFMK promptly canceled the agreement and then got hit by NASDAQ with a compliance notification, with the stock price hovering around the forty cent mark. In a complete reversal of market trend, IFMK started seeing their share price rise after covid hit, peaking at $2.13 on March 19. They were kind of just meandering along on a slow dip until February 2021, when volume spiked HARD with [46M shares traded on the day](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IFMK/history/). IFMK's float is just under 4M shares, with an average daily volume around 500K. I can't find anything as to why it exploded that day. I'm stumped. If you know or held during that time, please let me know. 

On their last quarterly earnings IFMK reported a revenue increase of 22.67% and in a rarity for a penny stock, profit. They are carrying a decent amount of debt, to the tune of \~$80M – more than their market cap. A lot of the debt that have taken on has been to foster growth[ through acquisitions](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ifresh-announces-completion-acquisition-jiuxiang-125000094.html) or [expanding their market area](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ifresh-launches-e-commerce-english-123000766.html), and they do carry assets around $130M – so I don't think bankruptcy is imminent.   

My main concern for IFMK is remaining competitive in their industry. I like that they are kind of a self contained ecosystem with everything in house, but I am worried about being in a niche market. At some point it does kind of strangle your reach as a company, but at the same time I also do think that their customer base is willing to spend money for the authenticities of home. Things that you can't get at Safeway or Trader Joes. Grocery stores already operate on [pretty thin profit margins](https://thegrocerystoreguy.com/what-is-the-profit-margin-for-grocery-stores/#:~:text=Conventional%20grocery%20store%20chains%20have,conventional%20grocery%20stores%20is%20competition.) so I'll be interested to see how IFMK is able to overcome that through innovation, expansion, and acquisitions.   

No position.

2021-03-19,*no position DD* SHIP - maritime madness,"*no position DD* SHIP - maritime madness Hey gang, its **Boom** here, with a continuation of a series of DD posts for companies where I currently hold no position. No position = objective outlook. My bad for the lack of DD for a few days, was having some technical and personal issues. Time to get back track.

SHIP – Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp (as requested by u/PatientInvestor) 

SHIP bills themselves as “t[he only pure-play Capesize shipping company listed in the US capital markets.](https://www.seanergymaritime.com/en/company-profile)” Like [CTRM](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robinhoodpennystocks2/comments/m3a2fx/no_position_dd_ctrm_a_reddit_favorite_that_just/), SHIP is in the business of marine dry bulk transportation. Raise money, buy a ship, put it to work, rinse, repeat. All of the vessels in the fleet's name end in “-ship” (ex: Partnership, Championship, etc) which is a cute, useless detail. They're also mostly painted red, whereas the company's colors are blue. Like CTRM, SHIP's stock price is going to be influenced by the [Baltic Dry Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baltic_dry_index.asp), which measures what the cost should be for shipping dry bulk.   

Institutions aren't really lining up for SHIP, [holding a miniscule 1.32% per Fintel.](https://fintel.io/so/us/ship) It is encouraging that [notorious short Sabby](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robinhoodpennystocks2/comments/m551gn/know_thy_enemy_short_sellers_and_vulture_funds/) recently exited their position, but other shorts such as Citadel, Hudson Bay Capital, Susquehanna, and Proequities hold the majority of institution shares. At least it's only a little over one percent. According to the trio of Whale Wisdom, NASDAQ, and OpenInsider, there is zero movement when it comes to insider trading, but they do own about 60% of shares.    

This is a company that has seen it's share price decline from absurd all time highs since being listed on NASDAQ in 2007. I don't know why, but this company was trading in the *thousands*  until 2015, then in the *hundreds* until 2019. Sharp price drops have coincided with reverse splits, which they have [done three times](https://www.splithistory.com/ship/) (1-for-5 in 2016, 1-for-15 in 2019, 1-for-16 in 2020), the last being to gain NASDAQ compliance, which they have successfully done. Really wish I could explain the *why* of all this, but I'm stumped. 

[Just yesterday the company announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seanergy-maritime-holdings-corp-acquire-130000328.html) plans two acquire two additional vessels, bringing the fleet total to 14. They haven't even taken hold of the vessel they[ announced they were grabbing in February](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seanergy-maritime-holdings-corp-announces-140000470.html). It seems the company is making a push for revenue growth after [refinancing some of their debt ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seanergy-maritime-holdings-corp-announces-141000517.html)and [bringing in cash with an offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seanergy-maritime-holdings-corp-announces-032000886.html). The same thing that [I didn't like about OSG](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m5pzds/no_position_dd_osg_a_bigger_worse_ctrm/) is also off putting in regards to SHIP. They are MASSIVELY in debt. Maybe that's just how it works in maritime, to be fair, I don't know enough about the industry. CTRM seems to raise funds mostly through offerings, but they are a relatively young company and haven't had time to build up their debt like OSG and SHIP.

SHIP's price is going to be tied more to the Baltic Dry Index than company fundamentals. This is the same reason I don't like oil-related stocks (outside of the ethics quandaries) – it's less about what the company is doing and more about a related market that a solidly run company can't out maneuver. I'm still learning technicals, but [most of the metrics from TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-SHIP/technicals/) list the company as neutral or a sell. 

While it's encouraging that he company is 60% insider own, it remains to be seen if SHIP can regain it's once lofty trading prices. They seem to be on the right track with debt refinancing and increasing the size of their fleet, but I think there are other avenues I would be looking to invest in the maritime industry. 

Position - none

If you know why SHIP used to trade at such an absurdly high price, I'd love to know as I couldn't find out. If there's something I missed, please don't hesitate to comment at how badly of an idiot I am. I'm all maritime'd out for now. On deck for this series is IFMK and RMTI, if there is another stock you would like to see covered, by all means, let me know.

OSG – Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc (as requested by u/green_mailer) 

OSG engages in the provision of energy transportation service for crude oil and petroleum products in the US flag markets. It operates Articulated Tug Barges (ATB), lightering ATBs, shuttle tankers, Medium Range (MR) tankers, and non-[Jones Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jonesact.asp) MR tankers that participate in the maritime security program. Relative to other penny stocks, this is an old company (founded 1948) that's only been listed on NASDAQ since late 2015. They primarily ship oil, and with a fleet of 110 vessels, they ship a lot of oil. Unlike a lot of other penny stocks, I couldn't find much information about share dilution or offerings, but taking a [closer look at the financials](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/osg/financials) gave me a bit of a pause. Let's get into it. 

On a positive note, institutional ownership is pretty high, at a robust [60.39% according to Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/osg). Usually a good sign. I say *usually* because it's not always the case, and I think that holds true with OSG, because as of Q4 2020, [put options outweigh call options at a 2.73 ratio](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/osg), according to Whale Wisdom. I find the especially interesting in contrast with the insider transactions, which has seen 40 open market buys over the last 12 months with a net total of 3.6M shares being scooped up by insiders, primarily 16% owner Saltchuck and OSG President and CEO Samuel Norton.   

Scouring the news releases for OSG over the last few years, I didn't find anything about share dilution or offerings, as mentioned above. With the exception of the offerings, OSG seems to fall into the [same pattern as CTRM](https://www.reddit.com/r/Robinhoodpennystocks2/comments/m3a2fx/no_position_dd_ctrm_a_reddit_favorite_that_just/), buy boats and put them to work. However moreso than CTRM, OSG is in MASSIVE DEBT. Their debt to equity ratio of 108% is bad. [They have long term liabilities around $675M.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-osg/overseas-shipholding-group#past) Their liabilities total [more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-osg/overseas-shipholding-group/news/heres-why-overseas-shipholding-group-nyseosg-is-weighed-down-by-its-debt-load). This is a company with a market cap of $225M that, if their creditors came calling, they wouldn't be able to pay (neither would I if mine came calling, to be fair). That's where Saltchuck comes in. 

Saltchuck is a massive private holding company with interest in freight service, real estate management, and of course, petroleum distribution. Saltchuck boasts $2.6B in revenue and is [ranked at #170 on Forbes America's Largest Private Companies list of 2020](https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/list/4/#tab:rank), right below Red Lobster (side note: I just make some [homemade cheddar bay biscuits](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-cheddar-biscuits/) from scratch, to die for). Saltchuck buys companies. And they've been increasing their position in OSG to where they now own 16% of the company. Positioning themselves as a massively influential shareholder could, in theory, help them shape the board, and in the long run lead the push for OSG to be acquired by Saltchuck. This might be the best way forward for OSG to help them with their debt. 

As far as trading OSG, the company has little volume, which is why I think we see such wild price swings. If you like technicals, it *is* trading above it's 20, 50, and 200-day SMA. Almost all of [TradingView's technical indicators ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-OSG/technicals/)are saying “buy”, but I'm still learning technicals myself, so I couldn't really tell you what that means.   

No position, no siree.

ITP – IT Tech Packaging   

ITP is a leading paper manufacturer in North China, [according to their website](http://www.itpackaging.cn/en/about-52-0-0.html). Using recycled paper as its primary material, the company distributes three categories of paper products: corrugating medium paper, offset printer paper, and tissue paper. All well and good, everybody poops. Taking a little deeper look under the hood, this company has a little bit more going on for it than *just* paper products. And I'm honestly not sure if that's good or bad. Anyways, this one caught my eye because it's cheap, cheap, cheap! 

Institutions own 8.95%, [per Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/itp), mostly mutual funds and ETFs. The largest institutional holder is Renaissance Technologies, [a $100B hedge fund](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1q3fndg77d0tg/Renaissance-s-Medallion-Fund-Surged-76-in-2020-But-Funds-Open-to-Outsiders-Tanked) that's big on algos and houses [one the most successful funds in investing history.](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) I was glad to see that insiders aren't selling – the last sale being in 2019 when the CEO sold 6% of his 5M shares, [according to Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/search?q=itp).   

Think back to the beginning of Covid-19, generally considered to be March 2020. We all got wrapped up in this crazy thing that we didn't understand and a bunch of idiots bought *ALL* the toilet paper. The law of supply and demand [sent the price high](https://apnews.com/article/53bf1ac57c50df34336c284bfe939212), which makes the [toilet paper manufacturing business great to be in, like ITP.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-inc-provides-updates-123000528.html) Their stock price rises again when they [announced its production line launch of non-medical single-use face masks](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-inc-launches-production-120000599.html). Apparently they needed cash and wanted to capitalize on their surging stock price, so naturally they send said price tumbling with [announcement of a direct offering.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-announces-pricing-approximately-130000573.html) They put this cash to use quickly, [reaching an agreement to acquire a large stake ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-inc-signs-letter-120000952.html)in an intelligent healthcare IT company, to bolster their earnings. 

Then ITP *really* swerved, [going in on clean energy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-inc-launch-construction-120000263.html), which could be a very synergistic money spinner for them considering [biomass cogeneration can be fueled through paper product waste](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/3971/making-the-most-of-biomass-cogeneration-opportunities). Through two other offerings of [$14M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-inc-announces-pricing-020700564.html) and [$20M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-inc-announces-pricing-043800902.html), respectively, ITP has raised almost half its market cap in funding. As of their Q3 earnings in November 2020, [the company had $30M in assets and $16M in liabilities](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-inc-announces-third-154400356.html), but right afterward raised that $34M through offerings that I previously mentioned. 

I think the big question is “What are they going to do with all that cash?” They could just need money to pay for the [biomass boilers they just bid on](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-inc-completes-equipment-130000076.html) for their energy production. Or they might be looking for further acquisitions to diversify their business even further. I imagine they want to get the energy production on line as quick as possible, as it could reduce current operating costs (use energy to make paper, use paper waste/byproduct to make energy). If they gain the license for their face masks in production, it could become a real money spinner as ITP [estimates a gross margin of 40% from the product](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-packaging-inc-provides-single-131000360.html). 

I was confused by the investment in the health care IT company and energy production at first, but after further review it seems to me like ITP is trying to streamline revenue and bolster their growing paper business. In my opinion this is another long term hold penny stock, as their expensive plans for energy production could see further share dilution before meaningful gains, but that entry point sure is attractive. 

Position: come on, do I really have to say it?

This is obviously not financial advice. I'm just learning here and hoping to share some knowledge with others. Please do further research for your investments.

What's Pulmatrix?

Pulmatrix is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary and non-pulmonary disease using its patented iSPERSE™ technology. The Company's proprietary product pipeline is initially focused on advancing treatments for serious lung diseases, including Pulmazole, an inhaled anti-fungal for patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and PUR1800, a narrow spectrum kinase inhibitor in lung cancer. Pulmatrix's product candidates are based on iSPERSE™, its proprietary engineered dry powder delivery platform, which seeks to improve therapeutic delivery to the lungs by maximizing local concentrations and reducing systemic side effects to improve patient outcomes.

r/pennystocks - In-Depth DD on $PULM biopharma pennystock partnering with giants like Johnson&Johnson, Cipla
https://www.pulmatrix.com/isperse.html

iSPERSE uses proprietary cationic salt formulations to create a robust and flexible platform that can accommodate high drug loads and large drug molecules in highly dispersible particles, yielding superior drug delivery capabilities compared to conventional dry powder technologies that rely on the use of lactose blending or low-density particles. The properties of iSPERSE have meaningful therapeutic and patient benefits, including single formulations with multiple drugs, effective inhaled drug delivery to patients with normal or impaired lung function, and the use of simple and convenient inhaler devices with highly reproducible dosing. Pulmonary drug delivery offers several advantages for both local and systemic applications. Drug delivery via inhalation for local applications results in direct targeting to the site of action and minimization of systemic exposure and side effects. The advantages of pulmonary drug delivery for systemic applications can include: rapid onset of action, avoidance of first pass metabolism, and elimination of injection.

As you can see, their pipeline is quite impressive. What's even more impressive is the capability of this company to ink such big partnership deals with the biggest Pharma-giants in the sector. Remember this is a pennystock, so it's a huge confidence boost to see such interest in it. They also have an extremely solid management, of course, which I'm gonna link here: https://www.pulmatrix.com/leadership-management.html . Take a look at the Board of Directors: these guys are already in the game, leading other biopharma companies such as Kala Pharmaceuticals, Arena Pharmaceuticals.

Pulmatrix recently had a DIRECT OFFERING https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pulmatrix-announces-40-million-registered-052400935.html **""**P. today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with healthcare-focused institutional investors for the purchase and sale of 20,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, at a purchase price of $2.00 per share, in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about February 16, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.""

So yeah it's already closed, it was priced AT THE MARKET, it was a direct offering so institutions got in at 2$. No brainer right? At the current price, you have the chance to get in for a better one. But you know what's even more interesting? The offering was made for ""healthcare-focused institutional investors""! This is the same bullish sign that I saw when Senseonics had its offering, seeing the interest in this company by healthcare experts made me add on the offering dips.

After this offering, they will have more than 70m in cash. They also receive royalties from partner Sensory Cloud upon sales of FEND, an OTC nasal hygiene product proven to reduce airborne respiratory droplets.

Check out their Q3 results, very promising and I'm looking forward for the Q4 ER https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pulmatrix-reports-third-quarter-2020-140000164.html

""As of September 30, 2020, Pulmatrix had $34.5 million in cash compared to $23.4 million as of December 31, 2019. Pulmatrix generated $4.4 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2019. The revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was the result of the collaboration and licensing agreements with Cipla and JJEI, respectively. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 were $3.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively. Included in the third quarter 2020 costs were pre-clinical toxicology and Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls costs for the PUR1800 program and clinical study costs incurred for the Phase 2 Pulmazole study. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 were $1.8 million. Included in the third quarter 2020 costs were general operating expenses such as employment, lab and office lease, legal, patent and audit fees. Net loss was $10.6 million for the third quarter of 2020 and $3.6 million for the third quarter of 2019. The net loss for the third quarter 2020 was primarily due to warrant inducement expense of $9.3 million and manufacturing costs for the upcoming PUR1800 Phase 1b clinical study and the recently terminated Pulmazole Phase 2 study. The net loss for the third quarter of 2019 was due to spend on the Pulmazole Phase 2 study.""

2021-03-12,*no position DD* SENS - cyberpunk sugar77,"*no position DD* SENS - cyberpunk sugar77  Hey gang, its **Boom** here, with a continuation of a series of DD posts for companies where I currently hold no position. No position = objective outlook.

SENS – Senseonics Holdings, Inc(requested by u/Agree_With_Me) 

Senseonics “engages in the design, development, and commercialization of implantable continuous glucose monitoring system for people with diabetes. [Their primary product is the Eversense CGM system](https://www.eversensediabetes.com/eversense-cgm-system) which “provides continuous blood glucose monitoring for up to 90 days via an under-the-skin sensor, a removable and rechargeable smart transmitter, and a convenient app for real-time diabetes monitoring and management.” That's super cool. Having had multiple family members with diabetes (I'm sure I'm next), I've watched people struggle with the constant finger pricking and monitoring of blood sugar levels.   

And I've seen this product, or one like it I'm not sure, in the wild. When I was driving for Uber, I picked up a young college student at a bar who seemed to be in a hurry to get home. He had been day drinking and left his insulin at home. Thankfully, he had an implanted blood glucose meter that alerted him that he needed to get his medicine. Now, I don't know why a diabetic kid is irresponsibly out cranking up his blood sugar levels by drinking a ton of alcohol, but I did think it was really cool that he had this thing in his skin, that talked to his phone, which let him know to take his medicine. Cybernetics won't be cool upgrades to our biology, it will prevent idiots from killing themselves in stupid ways. 

Anyways, [according to Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/sens), SENS is 19% institutionally owned. Saw a lot of index funds in there, as well as a general increase in holdings reported in February. [Via OpenInsider](http://openinsider.com/search?q=sens), we see that a 10% insider owner shed shares throughout 2020. Generally want to see those numbers going up, but I'm still trying to learn exactly how to interpret the trades meanings, especially since [according to the NASDAQ website](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sens/insider-activity), insiders have been *buying*, to the tune of 7M shares over the last year. 

In Aug 2020, [SENS announced a “strategic collaboration with Ascensia Diabetes Care”](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-announces-strategic-collaboration-ascensia-200500653.html), adding $80M to the coffers while making Ascensia the exclusive worldwide distributor of the Eversense system. In November of the same year, [SENS announced an equity line of credit financing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-announces-equity-line-credit-210400692.html), bringing in an additional $12M. Late January, SENS announced a [$50M offering of common stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-holdings-announces-50-0-221300088.html), which [increased to $100M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-holdings-increases-previously-announced-051800440.html), before finally [settling at $115M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-holdings-announces-closing-115-043300852.html). The underwriter of the agreement, H.C. Wainwright & Co had an option to buy more shares and executed it in full, I imagine because the negotiated share price was a sweetheart deal at $1.925/share when the stock price was sitting around $2.40. Looking at it now this has been a great deal for H.C. Wainwright, as the price rocketed over $5 in February before dropping a bit, but it's still over $3. Maybe then knew something we don't, much like it was reported that options writers might back in both [September 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-traders-know-something-senseonics-123312230.html) and [January 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-traders-betting-big-move-135401066.html). 

Some have [lumped SENS in with other “meme stocks”](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/zomedica-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO), but if that is the case, why have all of those big financing deals for stock been made before the market went bananas with retail traders YOLOing the house away? Big firms don't strike me as the “swing” or “day” trader type. 

It doesn't matter, because like so many penny stocks (even ones with good products), [SENS is not profitable](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nysemkt-sens/senseonics-holdings). Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed EPS estimates once. Over the same time span SENS has topped revenue estimates just once ([data pulled from earnings report, March 4, 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-holdings-sens-reports-q4-233511735.html)). On the positive side, their partnership with Asensia should start bearing fruit, [as they have commenced sales and marketing activities for the Eversense XL system in Europe.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senseonics-announces-initiation-european-commercial-130000035.html)   

SENS has a useful product, but serious cash flow problems. To put it simply, they are in massive debt. That's not always necessarily a bad thing, as you can use debt to facilitate growth, but they have way more debt than assets. I think they have too many partners at this time to risk bankruptcy, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were acquired by a larger company. I also wouldn't be surprised by further share dilution once they start nearing the end of their current cash runway. On the flipside, they have potential for really meaningful growth as they have what I think is a good product coupled with the Ascensia deal giving them reach beyond the US market.

I think a lot of DD can be biased based on the fact that the person already has a financial interest in the stock. By not holding a position, it can help us take a look at the stock objectively, so we can make the best decision based on our own individual research and investment strategies. 

DARE – Dare Bioscience 

DARE operates as a healthcare company, which engages in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products in women's reproductive health. Their three main products are Ovaprene, a hormone-free monthly vaginal contraceptive, Sildenafil Cream, a topical cream for women that [according to DARE's website](https://darebioscience.com/pipeline/sildenafil-cream/) “is designed to increase local blood flow without the associated systemic exposure and side effects, leading to an improvement in overall sexual experience and response”, and DARE-BVI, a “potential front-line option for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.” This company is doing the Lord's work. Less pregnancies and more “sufficient physical response to sexual stimulation.” They are based in my hometown of San Diego, so maybe I can volunteer my, ahem, services for their studies. Kidding, kind of. 

This ticker caught my eye [thanks to this helpful post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m2v2nc/dare_bio_is_way_under_valued_ticker_dare_check_it/) from u/Louisiana44, a screenshot from SimplyWall.st claiming that the company is undervalued. That, along with a 100% buy rating from RH piqued my interest. 

[According to data from Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/dare), institutional ownership sits over 18%. Going off Fintel's data, it looks like institutional ownership has increased since November 2020, with eTrade and Raymond James closing positions, and big names like Citadel, Goldman Sachs, and [Two Sigma](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1g1fp7k736xlv/Inside-the-Geeky-Quirky-and-Wildly-Successful-World-of-Quant-Shop-Two-Sigma) opening positions. Looking at insider buying data via Open Insider doesn't reveal much except that director Roger Hawley bought 450,000+ shares in 2019. So the board and ranking members of the company aren't selling. I suspect that the stock price surge around Jan 20, 2020 was institutional investors creating or increasing positions, as there were no catalysts for the company at that time.   

Like many (or all) clinical stage penny stocks, there are catalysts on the way. DARE-BVI has completed phase 3 studies, Ovaprene topline data should be available in 2022, and Sildenafil's Phase 2b topline data supposedly will be available this year. I personally think that Ovaprene will be their winner, if only because they have partnered with pharmaceutical giant Bayer, who own commercial rights of the product. Sildenafil has potential as a first-in-category treatment for Female Sexual Arousal Disorder. 

They beat their last earnings estimate by 9 cents a share in November, and the next expected earnings are March 25th. As a company that isn't going to be turning any profits until they get FDA approval for their treatments, my most important metrics are debt, equity, revenue, and cash/cash burn. [According to their last quarterly results,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dar-bioscience-reports-third-quarter-130000255.html) their R&D expenses tripled QoQ from the last year, with expenses partially offset with multiple grant fundings, including from the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dar-bioscience-receives-0-9-120000833.html). Higher operations and R&D costs increased comprehensive loss for the quarter, but they [raised some cash with offerings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dar-bioscience-announces-common-stock-120010446.html) and using their equity line (taking on debt).   

They're burning cash faster than ever as they ramp up R&D efforts, but offsetting that cash burn by selling stock and taking on debt is fine I guess, [but based on their latest company presentation](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-dare-bioscience-inc-8k-2021-march-08-18694-6), I wouldn't expect any catalysts soon. Maybe they are undervalued at the moment, but as for how long it will take the company to meet the lofty valuation expectations from SimpyWall.st, I couldn't say. To be fair, the same website a[lso notes the company has less than 1 year of cash runway, shares have been substantially diluted in the last year, they aren't expected to be profitable in the next 3 years, and they have negative shareholder equity.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-dare/dare-bioscience) 

This to me looks like a long term project, but the institutional buying is definitely attractive. Like all of the penny pharma/medical stock still in the clinical phase, one catalyst could send it to the stratosphere. For DARE, it's currently unclear when we'll see said catalyst and in the short term I expect further share dilution to keep up with the high cash burn rate. I would love to be wrong, I think they're product line fills a need for the market, and I always want to see my hometown companies succeed.

Position: None (although considering the products, there is considerable room for a \*VERY\* low brow joke here)

**AESE** – Allied eSports Entertainment   
AESE is an esports entertainment company, which engages in the creation of esports venues and live events for both video games and poker. [According to their website](https://www.alliedesports.gg/company), AESE is “a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs”. This is an esports company without a team, which instead focuses on events and event venues. Their flagship venue, HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, is a dedicated esports arena, which illustrates just how fast the industry is growing in the US. I don't know if esports will ever be [“bigger than music and movies combined”](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/esports-will-be-bigger-than-music-and-movies-combined-says-allied-esports-ceo-125058341.html) as their CEO claimed in 2019, but as we've seen with SLGG it is definitely a growing market with investors.     
  

AESE, despite their company description on RH, is all in on esports after [selling their poker-related business and assets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allied-esports-entertainment-announces-sale-140000252.html), including the World Poker Tour, for a tidy sum of $78M. What I find more interesting from the article however, is this bit - “The rapid growth and popularity of gaming and esports during the Covid-19 pandemic has driven strategic interest in the Company's esports business. Allied Esports has agreed to explore strategic options for the esports business, **including a possible sale”.** So they sold off a HUGE part of their business and are now exploring selling off the rest. Just last week, [AESE received an unsolicited acquisition proposal](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allied-esports-shares-trading-lower-175614521.html) from gaming (gambling gaming not gaming gaming) company and hotel/casino operator Bally's for $100M in cash, Bally's stock, or a combination of both. But Bally's wants the WPT, which AESE just agreed to sell. This is fascinating – AESE agrees to sell WPT and publicly states “hey, we'd be down to sell the rest of the company” and Bally's walks in with this big dick swinging move of “OK we'll buy it all, but we want the part you just agreed to sell, too.” Kind of a shitty business move if AESE backs out of the deal they have in place, but they don't really care because they're not going to be around anyways. WPT is a HUGE money spinner and fits right in with what Bally's does, so it makes sense that they want it. I guess the question right now for AESE is “Is the rest of our company worth $22M? Or are we willing to take a little bit less to let the whole thing go for a lump sum?”   
  

This company has massive institutional ownership. Noted short seller Susquehanna recently closed out their entire position as of December, with a lot of institutions adding positions, [per Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/aese). Insiders have been selling, which I don't find encouraging, but this looks like the type of insider selling that I may not necessarily understand. A 10% owner has been added to their position, but the insider selling has gone back to June of 2020. [Insider trading data is via OpenInsider,](http://openinsider.com/search?q=aese) perhaps someone with more expertise could translate what these trades mean.   
  

Earnings are expected in late March, and this will be the first year that we can compare based on the same quarter last year. This company only went public in 2019, so it's kind of hard to gauge their financials. They have $7.6M in debt, which is manageable with their market cap, and with either the closed sale of WPT under the current deal, or full on acquisition, they aren't hurting for money and won't be in the near future.     
  

I'm interested to see how this Bally's deal plays out. If AESE opts to keep their current deal they'll have a boatload of cash to expand the business to either make it more profitable or make it more attractive as an acquisition. Esports is something that has had growth and is kind of a pandemic resistant business. I see a lot of upside for this company, but I don't know what it would mean for a shareholder to hold and get bought out.  

Positions: None!

**CSCW** – Color Star Technology Co LTD 

**CSCW** is an entertainment and education company operating through its subsidiaries, which provide online and offline entertainment performances and music education services. Their flagship product has been the “Color World” app which recently launched globally after being Chinese exclusive since September 2020. The app currently offers online performances, live streaming, online celebrity classes and influencer co-branded products. The app generates revenue from it's subscription service. Seems pretty straightforward to me, get directing advice from an acclaimed director, get singing advice from Ashanti (she was on their website!).    

In an effort to expand even further globally, CSCW partnered with [two UAE companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/color-star-technology-announced-strategic-113000864.html) to “collaborate on cultural performance, cross-border tourism, entertainment education, and brand promotion.” This was followed by an announced of [expansion into the Middle East marketplace](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/color-star-technology-co-ltd-130000593.html), including the “establishment of 2 or 3 live house venues” from which to host concerts while streaming them via their app. Then they announced a [series of film copyright acquisitions](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/color-star-technology-co-ltd-130000108.html), with CEO Luke Lu commenting “A big part of the Company's future strategy will be to produce and acquire copyrights.” CSCW plans on generating recurring revenue from the copyrights and Mr. Lu hoped the Color World platform would function as a copyright exchange in the future. In February CSCW became the [world's first dual-listed entertainment technology company](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/color-star-technology-co-ltd-130000224.html) in the US and UAE after launching on NASDAQ Dubai, cementing the head first dive into the Middle East market.   

Mere days after announcing the NASDAQ Dubai plans they [announced a $26 million private placement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/color-star-technology-co-ltd-130000947.html), with plans to use the proceeds toward “the development of Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality technologies to create virtual communities for the Color World App”. CSCW claims they are collaborating with Silicon Valley engineers and a Chinese technology R&D company to create AI with blockchain technology specifically 3D virtual reality tech for online concerts. They want to make 3D concerts with wireless Bluetooth headsets for a fully immersive concert experience. The interesting thing about the fundraising is that it was at $1.30/share when the stock price was only $1 when the news broke.   

Institutional ownership has dropped, with notorious short seller Citadel taking up a small position of 30K shares. Meanwhile insider ownership sits at 24%, and insiders aren't selling stock. Like at all. Which I find encouraging. Also encouraging is that they have no debt, but they're not really making money, hence the offering. They keep wheeling and dealing, setting the foundation for what I'm sure CSCW thinks will be something big.   

This seems like a company with an idea that has significantly broadened in size and scope. Are they social media? A film company? Live music? All of that and more? They're casting a lot of irons in a lot of fires right now, so even though their app is monetized, I think it will be a while before CSCW starts bringing in profits. Revenue and cash burn will definitely be things to keep an eye on. I wouldn't be surprised at more offerings, eventually they'll need to raise cash to keep the lights on or fund more deals. 

\*As I'm about to publish this, CSCW is up 8% on [announcement of a movie dea](https://pulse2.com/cscw-stock-price-nasdaq-color-star-technology-increases-over-5-pre-market-why-it-happened/)l\*

They are [partnered with GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/endra-life-sciences-extends-ge-140000357.html)'s healthcare unit, recently extending their partnership agreement's term until 2023. GE is supporting NDRA's commercialization activities for TAEUS in exchange for rights of first offer with respect to manufacturing and licensing rights. That's a huge deal. They have kept in the news – inking their [first distribution agreement for TAEUS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/endra-life-sciences-signs-first-140000034.html), granted their [seventh Chinese patent for TAEUS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/endra-life-sciences-granted-seventh-140000801.html), granted their [14th US patent for TAEUS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/endra-life-sciences-further-strengthens-130000093.html), and announcing a new [clinical study partnership with a hospital in Switzerland.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/endra-life-sciences-announces-clinical-130000537.html) I see the deluge of news and partnerships as a testament to the strength of their partnership with GE. The stock really popped after the 14th US patent announcement. Before that they were actually in danger of losing NASDAQ compliance.     


Institutional ownership is encouraging, with institutions entering new positions and increasing holdings by about 2M shares, bringing the total institutional ownership up to 12.77%, per [Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/ndra). However what I find to be very discouraging is the amount of insider trading. Since October of 2020, the Chief Commercial Officer has sold 93% of his shares. The CEO sold off 44% of his holdings, the CFO sold 25% of theirs, and another director sold 23% of their holdings (via [OpenInsider](http://openinsider.com/search?q=ndra)). Never an encouraging sign to see so many insiders selling their stock, but the share price did spike after they did so. Maybe there is more behind the scenes going on that I don't understand.     


They don't really have a lot of debt, another benefit of their partnership with GE. NDRA can focus on the product and let the big boy do the legwork of wheeling and dealing. I speculate that is what has helped NDRA speed along the development of TAEUS. They have beat earnings they last 3 quarters, with their next earnings reported after hours March 25th. They raised about $5M with a public offering in December, so I'm interested in their earnings report to see what the cash burn has been like.     


This is a medical technology company that seems to generate good news consistently, has a great partnership with GE, and has institutions buying in. I am concerned with the insider selling, but I think there's more than I understand going on with that specifically, and I do think the overall good news outweighs the bad.     


Position: None, that's the point of this whole series!

2021-03-09,"IsoRay, Inc - Cancer Zapper. Med-Tech Dancer.","IsoRay, Inc - Cancer Zapper. Med-Tech Dancer. **$ISR** – IsoRay, Inc   


IsoRay is a medical technology company which engages in the development, manufacture, and sale of isotope-based medical products and devices. The company focuses on the treatment of cancer and other malignant diseases. They're zapping cancer. Sweet, fuck cancer, all my homies hate cancer. They have a proprietary isotope (which sounds very super villain-ish) that they use for brachytherapy – “an innovative cancer treatment that places radiation directly inside the tumor, or at the surgical margin allowing for a highly targeted treatment dose to be delivered to the target region, while limiting does to surrounding, critical structures.” (per ISR's website). They put little rice-sized pieces of radiation in people to treat only the malignant areas.     


I became interested in this stock when someone mentioned it perhaps as a [sympathy play off XELA](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m1cueu/as_the_market_recovers_and_we_got_tickers_like/), which recently ran 186% on the day. My interest piqued, let's take a deeper look.     


Per [Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/isr), institutions own just under 8.5% of the company. When I saw that notorious short seller [Sabby Management](https://utopiacap.com/2020/03/25/sabby-management/) and shady business guy [Barry C Honig](https://www.teribuhl.com/2020/10/22/barry-honig-allegedly-set-up-undisclosed-promotion-in-majesco-cool-pte-to-influence-stock-price/) were involved I was skeptical, but they seemed to have closed out their positions according to Fintel. More recent institutional investors are big names like Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, and a number of index funds. Over the course of the last 6 months company insiders, including their CEO and Head of R&D have been buying shares, which is always encouraging.     


Back in January, ISR was riding high, [gaining 229% over a thirty day stretch](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imagine-jubilant-isorays-nysemkt-isr-075157273.html) topping out at $2.47/share on the 20th. Then yearly [earnings disappointed](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/isoray-isr-may-report-negative-173105392.html) and they [announced a public offering](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/isoray-announces-pricing-45-million-133000149.html) of 36M shares @ $1.25 share to ""fund operations, research and development efforts, potential future acquisitions of complementary business or technologies, sales and marketing initiatives and of general corporate purposes."" Then in February, [quarterly earnings disappointed](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/isoray-isr-reports-q2-loss-223510625.html) as the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates. Their earnings didn't wow, but they missed on revenue too, which hurts. Amid this news they brought in a new VP of Business Development with a pedigree from Johnson & Johnson. Their cash burn was [considered favorable.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-were-not-concerned-085144930.html)    


So it looks like they have a good product, but they're not doing well. In my opinion they haven't had enough growth to start actually making money, as reflected in their earnings. For me, one of the most attractive things about IsoRay is that have no debt, which is not a likely story for a cash-burning biotech. They are expected to [break even in the near future.](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nysemkt-isr/isoray/news/isoray-inc-nysemktisr-is-expected-to-breakeven-in-the-near-f)    


In conclusion I'm not sure I would consider ISR as a sympathy play off XELA. I like their financials, specifically that they no debt and enough cash to keep going for a while without having to dilute shares more than they already have. They popped in January when they received an [FDA clearance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c4-imaging-announces-sirius-positive-215500323.html) and have been on a steady decline since.     


I like what they do and their financial situation, but like oh so many penny stocks, they really need some sort of catalyst to send them to the moon. They've proven that they can do it once already, I bet they can do it again. Patience is key here. They are presenting at the Oppenheimer 31st Annual Healthcare Conference on March 17th, I'm going to keep an eye on them for an attractive entry point and look out for news.

Short interest on the rise since mid January while stock price was increasing. 
Jan 15th - 95,428
Jan 29th - 638,817
Feb 12th - 1,514,538 
That’s a 1,580% increase in short interest in a month

Short sellers were wrong and the price kept increasing heavy till Feb 16th.

Then the catalyst went sideways, with an FDA hold, but no denial or approval, for the phase one announcement feb 16. Long after the feb 12 short interest date. Was taken for the NASDAQ report. 

This induced a sell off which made them double down on their bets. This caused a rapid spike to 1.99 right after the initial drop from the catalyst news of the FDA hold. 

Viewable on February 18 chart 2 days after bad news a random price spike? Sounds short 

Since then from experience on this ticker, we have watched shorts doubling down, raising the stock price $0.15-$0.40  instantly only to trickle down all day but hold the initial launch. 
I have noticed these spikes 3 times since I took my position. One of those being today March 4th in premarket sales. 

Take into consideration,
 the market as a whole was down hard today on the S&amp;amp;P but HSTO rose premarket and held all day.

Shorts are not winning here, and this ticker just needs volume!

Stock was near $7 last year, the short sellers have already had a field day with this stock over  the past year. HSTO is showing several positive signs that set the conditions for a short squeeze.


-The market cap is small

-relative volume high this week

-gap down from $6.80 

-short interest increasing parabolically for 3 market reports

-short volume trading is 26% of total volume with sideways price action!

-obviously I can’t tell you how shorted it is today, but signs are definitely indicative that it’s significantly higher. 

Do your own DD, HSTO is not a scam, plenty of technology in the pipeline and already has a cosmetic product in marketing phase. 
They also happen to be heavily shorted with sideways price action = incredible short squeeze potential.

2021-02-24,"GSAT DD (It's the spectrum, stupid)","GSAT DD (It's the spectrum, stupid) This is all off the top of my head but it’s a basic outline of why I think GSAT is a big deal. There are a lot of people who understand the company better than I do, but I really think this is worth looking seriously at, and its up a little bit today so here’s my first stab at DD.

Be advised: I’m not a sat com expert, nor is this investment advice and I really have no Idea what I'm doing here.

Also, I should say PT for GSAT range wildly, I've seen targets over $200 per share floated around with some pretty impressive analysis behind it, but more conservatively I'm in line with suggestions it could be $30-$50 by EOY.

GSAT owns c band and s band spectrum, which with the push to 5G and Internet of Things has suddenly become incredibly valuable. Recent FCC auctions will attest to this.

For years, GSAT was waiting for FCC authorization on that spectrum, but by the time they got it, they had issues with debt and investors were wary to jump in without a clear Monetization plan for their spectrum. The heavy debt situation has since been resolved, giving them enough of a cash runway to continue in for the next three years. Their business model during most of the past decade involved satellite phones and gps tracking, which, with their aging satellites and limited market for that kind of stuff, was never meant to do much more than keep the lights on while they waited for the value of their spectrum to appreciate. Their share price languished under $1 for a long time until 2021, when a couple things started to shift. They partnered with Nokia to set up a secure redundant 5G node for the port of Seattle, with more similar collaborations likely down the line. Then, most recently, QCOM announced that their next generation snapdragon modem, which is the most popular smartphone modem in the world, will connect to the n53 band specifically. GSAT owns this band of spectrum, nobody else. QCOM obviously did that for a reason, but as of now, there’s no widespread usage of that spectrum as it’s not really being used except by GSAT and that hardly at all.

Exactly what that means is unclear, but what it does mean is that within a few years, millions of devices around the world will have the ability to connect to that spectrum.

There’s a lot of DD out there breaking down price targets, but the truth is nobody knows, and Jay Munroe CEO and the other execs have shown an incredible amount of patience in terms of allowing their spectrum assets to appreciate. Starlink, AT&T, Verizon should all be interested in buying, and have probably all made offers or overstates, but GSAT has not bitten, even when they needed the money.

GSATs spectrum, I’m told, is compared to a large swath of undeveloped beachfront property in the middle of South Beach, completely clean and unsullied in the middle of an increasingly crowded and frenzied space.

They look like a penny stock at first glance but they are far from it, and it may be the ultimate 5G play.

You might ask: What about Musk’s Starlink? Aren’t they going to eat GSAT’s lunch?

Well, the truth Starlink probably doesn’t need GSAT spectrum, and for our purposes, GSAT is not really in competition with Starlink, as their current business model (which will be affected by Starlink) is not the source of the stocks theoretcal valuation. but if someone DID want to compete with Starlink, they would need to access GSAT assets. Which is another reason why Starlink might need to get there first, not because they need it but because they dont want anyone else to have it.

Starlink is a possible buyer for GSAT, not for their satellites but for their spectrum. The value of GSAT is NOT in its satellites or the ground units, its in the spectrum.

DISH is another possible buyer for GSAT.

Some people point to debt issues with GSAT . It’s true the company has diluted its shares quite a bit to remain solvent over the years, but they currently have enough cash on hand to give them a three year runway. It would make ZERO sense for another offering to occur BEFORE a major monetization event for the spectrum, and since this is 5G, that monetization event is going to happen WELL before they run out of cash. 

Another issue often raised: “The FCC can just seize spectrum and reallocate it if they want, that’s what happened to (insert late 90’s early 2000’s Sat company here)

These other companies, from what I understand, had major issues with solvency, and so they basically went to the FCC to see what kind of deal they could get if they surrendered it to be reallocated. BTW, I’ve learned that the correct way to talk about spectrum is not as something that GSAT owns or holds but as something they currently control. 

Seems Risky?

Betting on the value of Globalstar spectrum WAS a risky play, but now that QCOM has legitimized the value of the n53 band (albeit not explicitly or specifically in terms of eventual use case YET) by including it in the next gen snapdragon's connectivity ability, the risk associated with the play has diminished a great deal. 

The bear case of the QCOM aspect of all this is that including n53 connectivity is more of a marketing trick than something they imagine will actually get used, but given that n53 is extraordinarily underutilized at this point, even that scenario implies that QCOM expects to see expanded usage of that band in the short term.

Also I thought it was interesting that Nokia would publish this on their website: [https://www.nokia.com/blog/case-globalstar-6-ways-leverage-spectrum-asset/](https://www.nokia.com/blog/case-globalstar-6-ways-leverage-spectrum-asset/)

From Nokia:

“Nokia customer Globalstar Inc., a U.S. based provider of mobile satellite voice and data services, is in the enviable position of having 2.4 GHz spectrum that works everywhere, meaning it has been globally allocated. 2.4 GHz spectrum is in the sweet spot from a physics perspective because it’s good for both coverage and capacity. Although it’s not yet a 3GPP standardized spectrum band, it has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission and recently in other countries. It’s remarkably clean meaning it’s clear, has no co-channel interference and provides network benefits for both indoor and outdoor deployments.

Globalstar turned to Nokia to help determine the band characteristics for its available spectrum and identify potential application options. Nokia’s Network Planning and Optimization (NPO) team conducted a small cell network study of Globalstar’s 2.4 GHz spectrum as compared to a similar HetNet network in 2.1 GHz. The study proved the versatility of Globalstar’s spectrum, showing that operators with a small cell network could benefit from Globalstar’s clean spectrum, while those without small cell networks could benefit from its huge capacity.

In our study, Globalstar’s spectrum outperformed outdoor small cell deployments by 20%, while requiring 33% less infrastructure. For indoors in an urban office environment, we were able to deploy approximately half the access points required since the band has no interference from macro towers operating in the same frequency. The full report can be seen here. The team went a step further to also provide six business model options for Globalstar to consider.

“We were excited to work with Nokia’s NPO experts to help determine how to best monetize and maximize the use cases of our spectrum asset so we can deliver the highest quality experience to the end users,” said Jay Monroe, chairman and CEO of Globalstar.

6 ways to monetize & maximize the spectrum

1.Lease the spectrum to incumbent operators – This provides extra capacity for operators and uses their own RAN equipment and services. Operators can use clean spectrum without incumbrance and it supports standard capabilities like Carrier Aggregation, roaming and redirection. For Globalstar, this is a simple revenue model without any operational burdens.

2.Dedicated in-building small cell spectrum – The analysis clearly shows the difficulties presented by macro interference to small cell deployments. Offering a dedicated, clean spectrum band would dramatically improve the performance of these HetNets and significantly reduce the cost to deploy them. Globalstar could lease the spectrum to one carrier nationwide or carriers in geographic regions that wanted to reduce the strain on their expensive macro tower infrastructure.

3.Use the spectrum as a satellite service enhancement – By deploying RANs in Globalstar’s high use areas, such as air terminals, shipping ports, military bases or cargo handling facilities, Globalstar can both provide satellite offload and support high data rates and advanced applications. Enhanced services are provided to customers where they normally congregate, and for these customers there is a layer of satellite redundancy in the event of disruptions in terrestrial networks.

4.Lease spectrum for private LTE systems to non-carriers – Cable companies are increasingly interested in pursuing wireless services themselves. Globalstar’s spectrum provides an opportunity to add a private LTE network on top of their dense cable plant. Alternatively, as the in-building networks are further developed there may be an opportunity to include Globalstar’s band as a private LTE service on top of neutral host models.

5.Directly provide private services to enterprises – By offering private LTE systems directly to enterprises, Globalstar provides spectrum, equipment and services to end user customers, which provides direct control over the user experience and maximizes private LTE system revenue opportunities. These deployments of Globalstar’s spectrum could be done while several of these other options are pursued simultaneously.

6.Mass market product enablement licensing – Globalstar could license spectrum to ODM manufacturers for use in mass market. This would include unrestricted use and products distributed globally. This option could address the Internet of Things or Connected Car markets.

No matter what Globalstar decides to do, Nokia will be there to partner with them – in the U.S. and around the world. We are also lending our support to the 3GPP standardization process and equipment manufacturing enablement, which are critical for the spectrum’s success.”",0.0,Neutral,English

## What's more

I will be spending more time on this from now on as I am finished with my semester.

2021-02-22,DD#2 Inpixon ($INPX) - IoT Sensors for smarter indoor solution + Covid play,"DD#2 Inpixon ($INPX) - IoT Sensors for smarter indoor solution + Covid play INPX is trading at 1.73$ as of the writing of this DD.

Inpixon (NASDAQ: INPX) is a technology company that helps to secure, digitize and optimize any premises with Indoor Positioning and Analytics for Businesses and Governments in the connected world. Inpixon sensors are designed to find all accessible cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth devices anonymously. Paired with a high performance, data analytics platform, this technology delivers visibility, security, and business intelligence on any commercial or government premises world-wide. Inpixon’s products, infrastructure solutions, and professional services group help customers take advantage of mobile, big data, analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to uncover the untold stories of the indoors.

* **Share offerings**

INPX had 2 offerings, meaning they recently just raised a hefty amount of cash.

A 30M$ offering that happened on the 12th of February https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-announces-pricing-30-0-134500978.html

A 20M$ offering that happened on the 17th of February https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-announces-pricing-20-0-140000273.html

In the past, when a company does raise any kind of cash, it means they are developing things and need the extra cash in hand. The share price actually steadily increased over the last month, meaning all the sharing offers they did were eat up by big ivnestors+retails. When a share offering doesn't tank the price with like 20%, it means there is a lot of interest and buyers in this current company.

The combined offering means they raised 50M$ in the last 2 weeks. This is A LOT for a company that has their entire market cap just 150M$. That's 1/3rd of their market cap in cash they got through this.

By having these 2 offerings I also believe we will not see a newer one sooner, unless the price does explode up. I feel like now would be a good time to enter in.

* **Covid Play**

What does an IOT company have to do with COVID? Well, most of the products they develop are to optimize and connect the indoor world. So they are already in the space to place lots of devices inside your building to filter air. Which is exactly what they will do.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-co2-sensors-help-identify-143000039.html

They started selling their new CO2 Sensors to Help Identify COVID-19 Infection Risk.

Public health advice has been slow to catch up with the rapidly advancing science showing that COVID-19 is mainly spreading in enclosed spaces whenever people spend extended periods breathing tiny aerosol droplets suspended in air infected by the virus, according to Martin Z. Bazant, Ph.D at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Research by Professors Zhe Peng and Jose L Jimenez at the University of Colorado Boulder states that CO2 is co-exhaled with aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 infected people and as such, CO2 can be used as a proxy of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations indoors. Indoor CO2 measurements through the use of sensors holds promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.

If these things get traction, and I'm sure they will, these will be sold and placed in most public and private buildings in the near future to ensure the risk of spreading COVID-19 inside is kept at a minimum. INPX are positioning themselves in a very smart way right now. Getting a vaccine rolled out and getting the population vaccined for COVID is the first way of dealing with the current pandemic, but keeping the spread at a minimum level is a key factor in the near future, and INPX are doing exactly that.

* **Inpixon Wins IoT Sensor Company of the Year Award**

This is Inpixon's second consecutive IoT Breakthrough award. This latest award continues the consistent stream of third-party recognition garnered in 2020 which includes the 2020 IoT Sensor Product of the Year award for the Inpixon Sensor 4000, the Security Excellence Award for Inpixon Aware, and designation as a Visionary in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Indoor Location Services, Global.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inpixon-wins-iot-sensor-company-143000709.html

A key take-away from this is not only that they are a successful business, but it's also that they are a leading company in the IOT sensors market, **WITH THEIR CURRENT PRODUCTS**.

The award had nothing to do with their new CO2 sensors that help minimize the COVID-19 virus spread indoors. They were already a successful company, meaning their CO2 sensors will sell even easier, since they have a good background and solid experience to show their sensors are currently state of the art level.

The news regarding their share offerings and their CO2 sensors combined lead me to think they raised the cash in order to produce more CO2 sensors to sell, meaning a huge revenue in the short term that will help them continue the development of their already very good IoT sensor products.

* **Financials** 

https://fintel.io/n/us/inpx

Share price    1.83$

Shares Outstanding    58,978,461 shares

Insider Ownership	18.35%

Insider Ownership (Float)	25.61%

Total Insiders	14

Total Directors	8

Total Officers	8

LT Debt/Eq	0.00

What I like about this is they have 0 debt! This means the money they raised won't be used to pay off debt, it will be used for development. 25% institutional ownership is a good number, less shares available to the market. Making this a low float stock. Low float stocks -> higher upside potential.

* **Management**

I looked over through their management team, and there is one person that jumps out. Adam Benson, the company CTO.

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/09/25/1575714/0/en/Inpixon-Appoints-Retail-Industry-Veteran-Adam-Benson-as-CTO.html

Mr. Benson's successes include the implementation of interactive digital advertising and wayfinding solutions; deployment of public Wi-Fi services at retail malls which included data analysis on behavior, customer profile management, and a Facebook advertising integration; prototyping of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors; and development of offline store visit attribution methodologies.

I believe Adam Benson is a brilliant engineer and leading this r&d team will only bring great things in the future.

2021-02-18,"A noob's DD. Looking for feedback. Some of it is funny, I swear.","A noob's DD. Looking for feedback. Some of it is funny, I swear.  Hey gang, would like to start off by saying **I love this sub**! Boo me now because I'm new, I understand and probably deserve it. Yes, GME introduced me to the market. No, I didn't hold the bag or buy at 300. I got in, recouped my initial investment and have used the profits to basically start my portfolio.     
  

A little about me: I'm a career bartender with a near-useless degree in journalism. I'd like to think I pound on a keyboard semi-eloquently, but the most important tool I got from earning my degree was a sense of doubt of things that I didn't research myself (see: mainstream media). This tool has translated well into personal DD, but the current nature of all of these stock subs has me worried. And while I know this isn't a team sport, I'd rather not see some kind internet strangers get duped by bots or shills.   


We can all agree Reddit is a platform that is on the internet, correct? So if you're using Reddit, internet access is at your disposal. Which means at your fingertips is basically the repository of pretty much all of humankind's knowledge, plus a shit ton of fun memes and porno. When I see posts or comments like “Any DD?” I get confused. The tool to look up exactly what you are asking for is literally at your fingertips. Why not take advantage and check things out for yourself? The guy/gal posting the DD is selling you the stock. He/she is the pump, you're the dump.     


I don't have the capital to day trade, but if I see an opportunity I'll burn a day trade to grab a quick bag. I'm more of a mid to long term holder based off **catalysts**, but I do keep money aside to swing trade.  I wanted to share some of my personal DD. It's not meant to be investing advice at all. Some of these companies I hold positions in, some I previously held positions in, and some I don't (and probably won't) based off **my own research.** 

I am next to clueless when it comes to technical analysis and am trying to learn. Same with options. I'm not even going to discuss price targets, I just want to discuss the companies. I am open to any critique and criticism because **I just want to learn and get better at this.**   

 **Assertio Therapeutics –** ASRT Market Cap: $179.453M

In December the pharmaceutical company was given until June 28 to meet the $1 minimum bid remain on NASDAQ. Since then, they have announced a $5 million insurance settlement expected to be received Feb 17, but more interesting to me was the back-to-back direct offerings. Feb 5 ASRT announced a direct offering of about $14 million (22.6 million shares @ $0.62/share) with plans for “general corporate purposes including working capital.” Four days later on Feb 9 ASRT announced another direct offering around $34 million (35 million shares @ $0.98/share) again for “general corporate purposes including working capital”. Small company raises nearly 1/3 of their market cap in direct offerings hmm are they underwater? Not according the balance sheet ($99M debt/ $345M assets). Institutional ownership is over 44%. In Sept 2020, ASRT indicated intention for acquisitions in the next year. Is this what they are raising money for? Perhaps the upcoming March earnings call will shed some light. I speculate it will, but I'm fairly stupid. Having recently restructured their board, including bumping up former CFO (who in 2 years oversaw ASRT repay $720 million in debt) to CEO, and also “substantially reducing operating footprint” to the tune of about $45 million, I'm bullish on ASRT in the short/medium term.

 **Guardion Health Sciences, Inc –** GHSI Market Cap: $112.985M 		

Another company striving to regain compliance so it will remain on NASDAQ, which it has until March 15 to do so. A specialty health sciences company from my hometown of San Diego, GHSI develops clinically supported nutrition, medical foods and medical devices with a focus in the ocular health marketplace. It sounds wild, but they make food to help your eyes, which as a glasses  wearer AND glutton, I'm all for. In December they brought on a new CEO Bret Scholtes, an industry veteran who previously guided Omega Protein Corporation, pumping revenue, acquisitions, and (more importantly) stock price until it was successfully sold to a strategic buyer in 2017. Late January GHSI's Malaysian distributor announced it had received approval by the Malaysian National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency to slang their immuno-pills, which had Bret stoked as “a key part of our strategy includes expansion into foreign markets”. They MAY have an offering of up to $25 million soon according to SEC documents, which to me, in conjunction with their debt vs assets suggest planned acquisition. I like what they do, the new CEO seems capable, and they're from my hometown. I like it.

 **Acasti Pharma –** ACST Market Cap: $163.826M 	

ACST is a “biopharmaceutical innovator that has historically focused on the R&D and commercialization of prescription drugs derived from krill oil.” Using skrimps to help the heart (I know krill aren't shrimp, but it's way more fun to say skrimps than crustaceans). Their flagship drug, CaPre flopped hard in Phase 3 FDA trials in September, leading to an equally hard flopping in share price. They brought on Oppenheimer & Co as a financial adviser to “evaluate strategic alternatives for the company” aka our main product failed, we don't know what to do, how the fuck do we make money. They also said they MAY seek to raise additional capital through a variety of sources. Feb 9 came the earnings call and the outlook is...not so good. Their flagship drug didn't work so they don't really know what to do. Looking at the SEC filing, they slashed spending in R&D, sales and marketing. Really their only bright spot is that they have cash. Enough to fully fund their strategic evaluation or about 12 months. In late December the company made a press release essentially saying “we don't know why the price is going up”, despite really no positive news. While they DO have enough cash to keep the lights on while they figure out whatever the fuck their gonna do, they currently DON'T have any products in the pipeline. I think they're seeing some volume spikes because it's cheap and the recent influx of new traders looking for cheap tickers, but until I see some sort of catalyst, no thanks. 

 **Tonix Pharmaceuticals –** TNXP Market Cap: $472.914M 	

Tonix is another clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Focuses on “discovering and developing small molecules and biologics to treat psychiatric, pain and addiction conditions, to improve biodefense through potential medial counter-measures, to treat transplant rejection and to treat gastric and pancreatic cancers”. Whew. They doin' a lot. Let's narrow it down. According to a company presentation, the most advanced part of their drug pipeline centers around their Central Nervous System (CNS) portfolio, the most advance part of THAT are drugs for Fibromyalgia, PTSD Sleep Disturbance, Agitation in Alzheimer's and Alcohol Use Disorder. Cool, those things suck, help people with those things. To me, the more appetizing products lie in their Immunology & Biodefense portfolio, with multiple developments ongoing for a Covid-19 vaccine, which has been made the company's priority. The most recent update, Feb 8, TNXP announced they are pivoting from vaccine to a skin test to measure exposure and T cell immunity, causing shares to surge 30% that day. THAT SAME DAY, they singed an offering agreement of about 58 million shares @ $1.20/share, banking about $70 million. They also regained NASDAQ compliance. I'm unsure how I feel with the institutional ownership, as quite a few exited while quite a few entered positions. With their next quarterly earnings expected March 23rd, brokerages expect to report EPS of ($0.10). Yes, that's a negative. The positive is that compared to reported earnings of ($2.86) per share in the same quarter last year, we're looking at YoY growth of 96%. With a lot of irons in a lot of fires, seemingly a lot of money to work with, and a good PR team who keeps them in the news cycle, I'm sold. 

 **Advaxis –** ADXS Market Cap: $134.366M 	

Another one of those NASDAQ compliance cases. Advaxis is a biotech company which “engages in the discovery, development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies”. We curin' cancer boys. Fuck cancer, all my homies hate cancer. ADXS recently touched it's 52 week high on a Wednesday with, from what I can tell, zero catalyst. But then again, I'm still learning charts and technical analysis (and would greatly appreciate any input/resources to do so). It does look like the day before institutional ownership jumped by a little over a million shares but I'm not knowledgeable enough to interpret the data I'm looking at. I could be totally wrong. In January they received their first milestone payment for licensing one of their treatments. Later that month they published their financial results for the fiscal year including several offerings, reducing annual operating expenses by 30% and anticipating that currently, their cash runway will take the company into the second quarter of 2022. Several of their treatments partner with multinational pharmaceutical giant Merck's cancer drug Keytruda. They have a lot of cash, manageable debt, run with the pharma big boys, and are working to treat cancer. Fuck yeah. 

 **Bombadier –** BDRBF Market Cap: $1.108B 	

Whoooooooo boy do I see a lot of folks discuss/shill this stock. I understand the appeal. **IT'S CHEAP!** I believe it's the cheapest stock on RH. The Canadian business jet manufacturer recently had an earnings call that on first glance was not so good but digging into it a little bit more...well it's still not good in the immediate but it's not THAT bad. Laying off 1600 employees? Generally seen as bad. Selling off the rail side of the business? Also generally seen as bad, but I see it as a positive. The company claims to want to swerve to being a “pure-play business jet company” so jettisoning the transportation side of the business makes sense. Doing it because of your HUGE amount of debt? Both good and bad. Having 12 aircraft returned by Indonesia because Britain is investigating your company for bribery in airplane sales? Yikes that's bad. I could see this a very speculative loooooong term play. It's cheap AF and has that “set it and forget it” appeal, for me there's more I could do with my money before waiting for an aging industry titan to right the ship. 

 **Northern Dynasty Minerals –** NAK Market Cap: $397.718M 	

Another sub favorite, likely for the same reason as BDRBF **(IT'S CHEAP**), is NAK. But oh man, this one is just so much more fun than a boomer company trying to adapt to zoomer times. Northern Dynasty wants to mine for copper, gold, and Molybdenum (an element used for steel alloys) in the Bristol Bay region of Southwest Alaska. They have 100% ownership of the mine BUT they can't get a permit. Most recently the US Army Corps of Engineers rejected the Pebble permit application under the Clean Water Act, finding the project “is not in the public interest” and voicing concerns about the damage to the environment, specifically fish population in Bristol Bay. In September 2020, the Environment Investigation Agency (an international NGO that investigates and campaigns against environmental crime and abuse) released recordings in which NAK executives secretly revealed that the company intended the Pebble Project to be far bigger than publicly represented. **IT GETS BETTER**. The people from the EIA posed as potential investors in the mine and conducted zoom calls in which NAK executives detailed how they sought to curry favor with Alaskan senators and the Trump's white house chief of staff. **IT GETS BETTER**. NAK currently has a class action lawsuit on their hands *FROM THEIR OWN INVESTORS* for making false/misleading statements about the Pebble Project vis a vis Clean Water Act guidelines and project size and duration. **IT GETS BETTER**. Northern Dynasty and it's former CEO, who resigned in September after being recorded on said zoom calls, have been served subpoenas in relation to a grand jury investigation apparently involving the recordings of the private conversations. As I mentioned before, I'm not great with technicals, so the charts could be saying things that I can't read, but holy shit does this seem like a dumpster fire. The mine is their golden goose, but after listening to the recordings, it seems like they were counting their eggs before they hatched. I'm gucci off this one. 

 Sources I look through for data: Yahoo Finance, TradingView, FinViz, SEC website, fintel.io, google, company website. 

Sources I don't: Stocktwits. Just seems like a bunch of shilling/cheerleading, not a lot of data. Or at least not enough to sift through the bullshit. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: I'm new, want to learn. Rocket emoji diamond balls moon bullshit.     


Again, I'm open to constructive criticism, I'm just trying to improve. Cheers y'all.

**Who Am I?**

I'm a relatively new trader and a long time lurker that have made large gains due to this subreddit and I want to pay back my dues for this community and with that said do your own DD. Altogether this is my first DD so any feedback will be appreciated. None of this is financial advice unless someone wants to pay my college tuition or become my sugar daddy. I already posted on my stocks reddit account but it doesn't meet the rules of this subreddit so I'm resubmitting under this account.

My position as of now are 4 calls at $4 and 7/16

**What is this company?** *Mission Statement*

""22nd Century Group is a leading plant biotechnology company focused on technologies that alter the level of nicotine in tobacco plants and the level of cannabinoids in hemp/cannabis plants through genetic engineering, gene-editing and modern plant breeding.""

"" Our primary mission in tobacco is to reduce the harm caused by smoking by bringing our proprietary reduced nicotine content tobacco cigarettes – containing 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes – to adult smokers in the U.S. and international markets.""

"" Our primary mission in hemp/cannabis is to develop proprietary hemp/cannabis plants with valuable cannabinoid profiles and agronomic traits and to commercialize those plants through a synergistic portfolio of strategic partnerships in the hemp/cannabis industry.""

\-From their [website](https://www.xxiicentury.com/)

They achieve this through their extensive patents on controlling nicotine production in [Tobacco](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/14/2108651/0/en/22nd-Century-Group-Achieves-Breakthrough-Technology-Granted-New-Patent-for-Reducing-Nicotine-in-Tobacco-Plants.html) and control of CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids in [Cannabis/Hemp.](https://www.xxiicentury.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/414/22nd-century-group-and-keygene-launch-advanced-cannabis) With tobacco they are the leading company with a lower nicotine tobacco product as with other tobacco companies are at least a [decade](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/22nd-century-announces-the-immediate-feasibility-of-the-fda-s-nicotine-reduction-plan/) out from having their own. This market being large with increased sentiment towards quitting smoking due to a more health oriented mindset.

Also check out this post for more detailed information regarding the other red flags https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lmcvov/sos_ltd_full_dd_garbage_stock/

I created this post to warn people about the stock ""SOS Limited"", ticker symbol ""SOS"" possibly being a pump and dump, people are following each other like sheep into this complete garbage company that's most likely essentially an empty shell.

If you visit the company website, you'll quickly see a bunch of red flags (if you take the time to read through their news tab and check the annual reports). But the most obvious red flag is the company from which they mention buying the mining rigs from, you can find the news about at their website (https://service.sosyun.com/portalenglish/page/news_list_210121.html).

The company name is ""HY International Group New York Inc "" (mentioned in above link). If you do a quick search for this company via google, you'll find their website (http://www.hyfth.com/). The website claims to be ""The world's largest mining machine matchmaker"". Thats a bold claim when their website was created literally last week... that's right, LAST WEEK. You can look this up yourself with the following site (https://websiteage.org/).

The mining website was basically created 2 weeks after the announcement from SOS, that pretty much says it all. What I think happened is that they released the mining purchase news, then noticed how their stock was gaining traction. To make it all seem legit, they create a fake mining website.

If you compare the SOS site and the mining site, they basically have the exact same layout, even tho the mining site is supposed to be US based. They have literally cloned their website and put some mining rigs on the front page to make it seem legit. The ""contact us"" tab has a fake name (Claire Low), they added a fake phone number and a fake chineese adress just today, they even have an adress that points to trump tower ( 40 Wall St, FL2808 NewYork, NY 10005 ), great effort. Their whole news tab has articles that go back all the way to february 6th 2020, how is this even possible if the website was created last week.

There are alot of other red flags the company signals, but i feel like this part is enough for people to feel confident about this being a scam. Get out asap.

**TLDR SOS releases news about buying mining rigs from a company ( HY International Group New York Inc. ) that doesn't exist, the stock gains traction during the coming weeks and shoots up in price. They notice this and create a fake website connected to the mining company they mentioned (http://www.hyfth.com/). The website is cloned directly from the SOS site, with the exact same layout(even tho its supposed to be US based), except some mining rigs at the front page to make it seem legit. They even claim to be ""The world's largest mining machine matchmaker"" while being created 2 weeks ago. I repeat, the website was created 2 WEEKS AGO.**

**The original adress points to trump tower. The phone number and the chineese adress were added today. The site has articles that date back to 2020, even tho the website was just created 2 weeks ago. Get out before it dumps.**",0.0,Neutral,English

2021-02-14,Stocks I am watching this week (and why) - feb 16 2021,"Stocks I am watching this week (and why) - feb 16 2021 Hi everyone, here are the stocks I am watching this week.  I am already invested in MVIS, to let you know.  Have been for awhile and love the company still. Im not a finance advisor obviously, do your own research.

I am super bullish on $BRQS and $MVIS.  These are holds, I think that MVIS could be going to triple digits end of the year, but also can see a buyout happening in the next 3 months which would be at a minimum of 75$ a share. 

$BRQS I'm bullish on as well as more of a month swing trade as well. The IoT is a huge market place and they are in a good spot.

Break down the chats and news now...plus 2 more stocks.

$MVIS - You can see we are in a stage 2 up trend. I don't think this stock comes down in the long run, with its tech and continuous good news, this will be a long run. We found a base as you can see now we are going upwards.  This doesn't mean we don't have a red day, it means over the weeks/months we will be green. Chart below:

[https://ibb.co/885cZ3y](https://ibb.co/885cZ3y)

$BRQS - Another stock I love.  This stock looks identical to $MVIS, and that's the main reason I love it!  It's a 5G Tech stock under 5$, which is a steal.  They are global leader in things IoT, tech stocks are hot right now, and the chart looks great. They are planning on launching a bunch of products this upcoming year - very promising. Chart below:

[https://ibb.co/ckXJ8Vj](https://ibb.co/ckXJ8Vj)

$BB - $BB is a WallStreetBets stock...yes, but I also love it because there was actual news and good tech behind it. No it isn't a phone company, its a self driving company now and security.  It has recently announced a bunch of partner ships in the self-driving space, chart is looking promising, if it breaks 13.75, I will really start to watch this.

[https://ibb.co/jHyJ1Qv](https://ibb.co/jHyJ1Qv)

$IDEX - Wall Street (hedges) don't like this stock, but I am starting too.  I am keeping an eye on this stock on Tuesday to see what happens and may find a entry point, but we will wait and see.  Its on a huge uptrend right now, but it may pull back into a good buying opportunity.  Chart is questionable, and will need to see how this week plays out!

Happy Friday guys lolguy999 here bringing you my DD on **ENTX**.

&#x200B;

**Smol Highlights**

ENTX is a company I’ve been seeing some potential to finally make a post on, with potential catalysts coming up and positive price targets from analysts, I see this stock being a winner in the medium/long term. 

ENTX has a **small market cap of 60M** and an **institutional ownership of just over 10%**

Entera’s platform technology, which enables the oral delivery of large molecules, has the **potential for use in biologics which represent approximately 30% of all U.S. FDA drug approvals between 2015 and 2018, and $20 billion in annual sales.**

Company is very transparent with its status and progress updates. Releases reports and news every month.

&#x200B;

**What is ENTX?**

Entera Bio is a product-focused biotechnology company specializing in the oral delivery of large molecules and biologics. They are currently conducting clinical trials on its **proprietary technology which allows oral delivery of large molecules** and biologics while enhancing their absorption in the GI tract.

Entera Bio's technology **addresses the two major problems of oral drug delivery of large molecule APIs** (active pharmaceutical ingredients). Most large molecules cannot be administered orally as they are not readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and are rapidly degraded by a myriad of enzymes and acids in the gastrointestinal tract.

Entera’s Proprietary Technologies Act Synergistically to Transport and Protect Large Molecules.

&#x200B;

**How will this technology help (hu)mankind?**

“Entera and its highly promising oral protein drug delivery platform through advanced clinical trials with the hope of giving patients a much-needed oral alternative to treatments currently delivered via injection.”

This technology has the **disruptive technology to allow for patients to continue their treatment in the comfort of their homes or on the go**. This is a more comforting and less invasive delivery system that gives the patient more freedom during their treatment.

As a substantial percentage of FDA approved drugs each year are injectable biologics, ENTX seeS a significant opportunity for Entera’s platform technology to deliver these approved products in oral form.

Osteoporosis

\-Affects 200 million people worldwide, USA estimated $25.3 billion in costs each year

\-Disease characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue

\-PTH aims to reverse Osteoporosis by increasing the rate of bone formation. 

\-Current high cost, low dosing and daily injection, make it less desirable for patients.

\-Entera’s platform technology has taken PTH and enabled it to be delivered orally

\-For reference the global market for injectable PTH currently is $4 Billion.

Hypoparathyroidism:

\-Condition in which fail to produce sufficient amounts of parathyroid hormone (PTH)

\-Commercial PTH injection was approved in the United States by the FDA 2015

\-Oral form of PTH would be significantly advantageous.

\-Phase II clinical trial with its oral PTH 1-34 comparable to a commercial injection.

(NASDAQ: ENTX), a leader in the development of orally delivered large molecule therapeutics, today announced a new research program for an oral glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analog based on the Company’s platform technology. GLP-2, a peptide produced in the intestine and the central nervous system via the brainstem and hypothalamus, is known to **enhance intestinal absorption, specifically the increased absorption of nutrients.**

**Summary:**

We have a small 60m market cap company that seeks to use their proprietary technology to deliver treatment to diseases in an easy, minimally invasive way. The company has no debt and covers their assets exceeding their liabilities by far. They innovate under the guidance of their proven successful CEO with 30+ years and their highly accredited and accomplished R&D president with 20+ years experience. This stock is still relatively small and hidden, once their product and process gains more recognition, we should see very good upside in the medium/long term.

The company is expected to report EPS of -$0.53, up 22.06% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $97.20 million, up 6330.45% from the year-ago period. No PT, FUBO has a huge following online, but if you put a gun to my head, I would yell $56.36 to be on the safe side.

This is my DD on $ISR: Their FDA approval for SIRIUS and cesium based prostate cancer treatment technique has been met with very positive reviews from a recent medical conference at the beginning of 2021 (their stock price soared 2x within a week).

I work for a data analytics company (see my reddit profile) and I work a lot with bio-med/tech firms from a security, IT Operations and business analytics perspective.  So part of my job is to literally do DD research from a technology perspective.  

So when I correlate stock data to Quarterly earnings calls, industry events (both directly and indirectly related), I find trends in stock prices going up or down.  Typically with bio-med/tech stocks there is a high probability for a day-of and day-after dip and a quick rebound to either the same price or higher.  ISR fits that model.  I'm sure all of you have noticed the pump and dump of bio-med/tech stocks here over the last few weeks.

I suspect that ISR's quarterly report will be positive as sales of SIRIUS and other products for cancer treatments will be a contributor for large growth.

My take as a mouth breathing, knuckle dragging investor?

- 💎✋ for 1 Year + gainz and lower Cap Gainz tax.

2021-02-07,"$LKCO, Luokung Technology, is a sleeping giant in the cloud geospatial world","$LKCO, Luokung Technology, is a sleeping giant in the cloud geospatial world   

Hello traders/investors,

$LKCO caught my attention last week, and I decided to do my DD on this stock. Here is what I have found:

Luokung Technology has **5** main projects:

**I.Suzhou SuperEngine Graphics Software Technology:**

SuperEngine is a spatial-temporal big-data processing technology. SuperEngine has the world's first spatial-temporal data processing technology with independent intellectual property rights. SuperEngine provides PaaS (platform as a service), SaaS (software as a service), and DaaS (data as a service) intelligent services that can be applied in **Aerospace**, Land, **Transportation**, **Smart City**, **Surveying,** and **Mapping**.

If I understand correctly, the Chinese government will use SuperEngine for surveillance, analyze the internet of things, analyze smart vehicles’ networks and manage the smart IoT industry. 

**II.eMapgo (EMG) Technologies:**

Note: LKCO is in the process of acquiring 100% of eMapgo

eMapgo is one of the leading navigation electronic map service providers in China. EMG provides users with navigation electronic maps, ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) map, and HD maps (extremely high definition map at centimeter-level that powering autonomous vehicles) 

eMapgo accounts for 25% of China's OEM in-car navigation market share currently.

eMapgo has a lot of partners with major automakers, such as Toyota, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Chrysler, and so on.

Recent catalyst news: EMG recently worked with BAIC BJEV to provide HD map services in autonomous valet parking (""AVP"") for BAIC New Energy vehicles. The two parties will cooperate in-depth on L3 (conditional driving automation) to L4 (high driving automation) autonomous driving-related projects. 

**III. Zhong Chuan Shi Xun:**

An application that has artificial intelligence and big data technologies to provide users with spatial-temporal portrait, to **push to users with precisely location-based content and marketing services**. It then provides you interactive content and service based on the geographical location of the users.

**IV.Botbrain**

Botbrain is basically Natural Language Processing. Basically, sort of like google home processes your voice and personalize the content for you.

**V.YLAD (Yuanli Anda Technology Limited):**

China’s leading indoor positioning and location data marketing service provider, offering the indoor location service for public buildings. **YLAD** has the largest **indoor** geographic location in China.

**The scenario for YLAD:**

Imagine when you walk inside a mall, **YLAD** will track and analyze your data, which stores you visit the most, your brand loyalty, and so on. In your next visit, **YLAD** will send you a personalized suggestion route based on your last shopping-experience (much like Youtube sends you suggested videos based on its algorithm)

**Price target**: the sky is the limit.

**Trump's administration realized LKCO's true potential and decided to soft ban it:**

Trump’s administration had done the due diligence for us. They put LKCO on the Department of Defense’s blacklist to limit investors from buying them. For example, Webull’s users cannot purchase this stock as of now. Due to this soft ban, the stock price has been on discount for quite some time. Once Biden’s administration eases the tension with China, LKCO's price will be back full speed. 

**Combination Scenario:**

Imagine you are inside a self-driving car. You will tell the car what destination you are going to (the Luokung’s **Botbrain** AI will interact with you). The car will take you to the destination, in this case, a shopping mall (the self-driving features will be powered by Luokung’s **SuperEngine** and **eMapgo** Map). Once you get to the mall, **YLAD** will send you notifications, suggesting which shops you should visit. At the same time, **YLAD** will collect your data footprints and commercialize them (much like Facebook or Google selling your personal data). Once you are done with the shopping trip, you then can share your experience with your friend on social media app- **Zhong Chuan Shi Xun App** (much like Snapchat or Yelp Food App)

**TLDR**: LKCO will be a major player in IoT Industry (including self-driving cars) in the future.

# Supercom: Explosive Potential, Limited Downside

Feb. 03, 2021 8:00 AM ET[**SuperCom Ltd. (SPCB)**](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPCB?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Csection_asset%3Ameta%7Csymbol%3ASPCB)

&#x200B;

**Summary**

&#x200B;

* We contend the current share price eliminates the downside risk in the story and represents an asymmetric risk/reward profile.
* The CEO’s family owns over 28% of the Company and based on our interactions is eager to recreate the value creation that occurred in 2013 and 2014.
* While none of its coronavirus tracking pilots have materialized into a formal, large scale contract, news is gaining momentum in the Company’s backyard, Israel.
* We view the base level value of the Company to be $7.00 per share based on a multi-year estimate that revenues will rebound back to $35mm.

Sabra Capital Partners, LLC has a high conviction position (33% of portfolio – we do not suggest others follow suit) in Supercom ([SPCB](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPCB?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link); $1.20) after owning a position in this Company at various times over the past decade. We last [wrote](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4080435-supercom-transition-complete-ready-to-fly?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) about Supercom in July 2017 at $3.00 per share, believing it would hit $5 per share. It did at the end of the 2017 but a series of missteps and a disregard for its shareholders created a vacuum of interest by investors leading its stock to a low of $0.25 per share in the aftermath of the covid sell-off last year. However, we believe the future for the company is brighter than any time in its recent history and expect intermediate trends to generate a multi-bag tailwind for shares in Supercom. Fortunately for new investors, liquidity in the stock over the past year has been fairly abundant for a small-cap company so building and exiting a position should not be a barrier to entry. We are comfortable putting on a 33% position for the following reasons: 1) we are highly risk tolerant and arguably foolish in our capital allocation; 2) the Company’s business model and revenues are highly recurring with enviable gross margins; 3) we maintain revenues hit an inflection point in 2020 and will exhibit an impressive growth trajectory over the years to come, providing justification for an expanding valuation multiple; 4) current cheap valuation; and 5) a new CEO who successfully built an impressive U.S. business and is committed to returning to timely reporting at the corporate level. The Company currently trades at a discount to its book value and 2.0x our projected 2021 sales. These valuation levels indicate a company that is out of favor and declining. Conversely, we envision that the next 3 years will be far different than the past 3 years. We expect SPCB to rebuild investor confidence through timely communications and outreach with investors while building value over time through new contracts. As the Company expands its base of business, we believe Supercom will raise shareholder friendly capital to pursue larger contracts thereby creating a virtuous cycle. We view the base level value of the Company to be $7.00 per share based on a multi-year estimate that revenues will rebound back to $35mm. Moreover, the Company’s shift to a higher quality revenue mix from enterprise and developed markets creates more dependable business patterns going forward. We contend the current share price eliminates the downside risk in the story and represents an asymmetric risk/reward profile. In addition, the CEO’s family owns over 28% of the Company and based on our interactions is eager to recreate the value creation that occurred in 2013 and 2014

Our long thesis can be summarized as follows:

## Business Segment Details:

Supercom’s IoT division provides electronic offender monitoring and tracking (“EM”). Supercom entered the space with the acquisition of Leaders in Community Alternatives (LCA) on January 1, 2016 for $2.9mm. At the time, this division did $9.0mm in sales and provided the Company a vital presence in California. We note the revenue run-rate of this division was impaired by the staggered shutdown of the courts throughout 2020. Without the courts operating on schedule, there are fewer cases approved for EM. We believe court closures will be less frequent in 2021 and the burgeoning growth prospects for EM in the U.S. will be more apparent. Historically the Company won 65% of bids in Europe despite reduced sales and marketing efforts. The Company’s success rate is due to its superior technology (i.e. longer battery life of 1-3 years compared to 1-2 days for competitors; seamless communication with the phone; biometric authentication) and strong word of mouth. Supercom earns a $3-4 daily rate for its devices depending on configuration and carries a 70% gross margin. The Company also earns a servicing fee of $12-25 per day in California based on an income sliding scale which delivers 30-40% gross margins. We expect the Company to roll-up/acquire more servicing companies in other U.S. geographies to create a fully integrated model/offering. As a note, most of Supercom’s contract wins range between 20-200 units in the initial six months of the contract. With a better capitalized balance sheet, we are optimistic Supercom would be well positioned to successfully bid on large potential contracts with thousands of units in the first stage, creating a paradigm shift for its operations.

The Company’s e-Gov division provides governments with a comprehensive, end-to-end solution for the deployment and management of secure government identity programs (i.e. passports, driver’s license, etc.). Supercom’s solutions are deployed across over 20 countries. The Company has shifted away from this business as all major deployment and implementation projects have been completed. Currently, this division generates a modest level of high margin, recurring revenues through consumable sales, software licenses as well as maintenance and support services. These recurring revenues generally last over ten years from the initial deployment. We do not expect this business to be a meaningful contributor to growth in the foreseeable future.

The Company’s Cyber Security division was created following two acquisitions. Supercom bought Prevision for $1.1mm in November 2015 and Safend for minimal working capital out of bankruptcy in March 2016. The Cyber Security division benefits from synergistic technologies and a shared customer base with its other divisions, creating strong cross-selling opportunities. We expect this business segment to become a greater focus for the company once its EM division matures further given the threats facing data integrity and strategic assets.

## Coronavirus Tracking – One Massive Near-term Opportunity Worth Monitoring:

Supercom announced five (5) pilots to countries in the Middle East, Central and South America for coronavirus quarantine home containment in 2020. While none of the pilots have materialized into a formal, large scale contract, news is gaining momentum in the Company’s backyard, Israel. Due to various segments of Israel’s population blatantly disregarding quarantine rules and its inability to contain the virus to-date despite a highly touted vaccination program, the [discussion](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/israel-could-demand-returning-israelis-wear-electronic-bracelets-657184?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) to utilize the Supercom’s technology has [intensified](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/1612025094-report-israel-mulls-forcing-returning-travelers-to-wear-electronic-tracker?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link). Israelis are known to be avid travelers, bringing variations of the virus back home with them. To combat this problem, Israel has shut its borders to all travelers over the past week, even its own citizens seeking to return. This is clearly not a long-term solution despite Israelis refusing to stay isolated in coronavirus hotels (on the state’s dime) or abide by mandated travel restrictions once home. Many view the GPS tracking option to be a strong alternative to minimize the spread of the virus from abroad and to enforce fines on those travelers disregarding the rules.

It seems like Israel will make a critical decision in the coming weeks whether it will require these devices on returning travelers. If approved, this will represent the biggest contract in Supercom’s history and immediately lift the Company into the stratosphere. To illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity, nearly [5 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Gurion_Airport?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) travelers passed thru the main airport in 2020, despite the coronavirus pandemic. Given the recent normalization of ties with other countries (i.e. UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, etc.), it seems that Israelis are even more motivated to travel. In the event of approval, we would caution investors that government approval to impose GPS trackers on its citizens would face numerous legal challenges. The government did approve tracing Israelis on their phones in order to alert people who had come into contact with the coronavirus under a temporary special coronavirus surveillance power.

## Traditional EM Opportunity:

Excluding corona-related opportunities, the market potential for Supercom’s traditional EM solution is enormous and we expect this business unit to provide a stable, recurring, high-growth engine for the next several years. In the last five weeks of 2020, the Company announced the securing of 4 separate EM projects in the U.S. and the commencement of another project in Latvia. We expect additional contract wins are forthcoming.

The tailwinds for this business are unlikely to abate in the U.S, especially under Democratic leadership, or abroad in the near-future. The primary drivers include prison overcrowding, a shift toward decriminalizing drug use, a reduction in recidivism as well as substantial cost savings for the penal system. One of Biden’s first executive orders was to eliminate the Justice Department’s use of private prisons. We foresee the cost-benefit analysis of shifting toward EM solutions will become a widely supported trend worldwide.

Supercom provides all the essential hardware and software for the EM market including the phone, bracelet and house unit. In Europe, the Company’s customers generally use the house unit whereas in the U.S., the phone is more widely provided. The Company has publicly disclosed contracts in Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Bulgaria, Sweden, Estonia and Latvia in Europe and various local/municipal agencies in the U.S. While the Company has enjoyed early success capturing business in Europe by beating out incumbent providers, the U.S. seems to have the most upside potency for the Company. Either way, provided the current size of the Company, any meaningful contract wins will move the growth needle.

## Hyper Growth Ahead:

After a covid impacted 2020, we believe results will bounce back sharply in 2021 and beyond with accelerating results factoring the above discussed tailwinds in its largest business. While the company has impressively rightsized its operations (headcount reductions, etc.) for its current business trends, we expect the Company to capitalize on the burgeoning EM opportunity ahead of it by boosting its manpower and resources. This may create cash flow deficits in the quarters to come. Nonetheless, we have strong confidence investors will reward Supercom with a higher valuation once its strong growth potential/profile becomes more apparent. If successful, the Company will be able to readily tap the capital markets to shore up its balance sheet which will inevitably lead to bigger contract opportunities.

Note: Excludes share-based compensation and amortization

Given the strong business mix and visibility, the Company’s run-rate revenue is on the cusp of a multi-year revival in our opinion. We conservatively forecast $20.2mm and $27.0mm in revenues for 2021 and 2022, respectively. Pro-forma gross margins will follow the same path and exceed 60% as economies of scale work in the Company’s favor with increased size. We are optimistic Supercom will return to timely reporting which will make a small contribution toward improved investor confidence. Successive reported quarters of accelerating revenue growth will be a larger contributor.

## Massive Upside:

We conclude that Supercom’s current trading level provides a compelling entry point considering its improving fundamentals and efforts to regain credibility. For the past three years, investors have been frustrated with an apathetic management team that drifted from standard reporting and regular earnings conference calls. In fact, Supercom has yet to file its annual report on time since 2015. The last two years were especially abhorrent with filings in the last 30 days of the following year. These factors have contributed to a large and persistent discount on its shares to forgotten status. However, we believe the new CEO is energized to resolve these issues promptly and permanently. Provided the Company’s compelling prospects, market positioning and industry tailwinds, we contend the risk at these levels is limited and view the equity as a multi-bag story in its infancy. If management executes on its strategy and the growth story materializes, we are confident investors will reward the Company with significant multiple expansion.

With expanding market multiples across the board, it is difficult to unearth asymmetric opportunities such as Supercom. At 2.0x trough estimated 2021 sales, Supercom is a cheap growth vehicle. Additionally, Supercom has morphed into a predictable business model with recurring revenues and high gross margins. Similar businesses fetch revenue multiples well into the mid-single digits. Based on a similar revenue multiple of 4.5x forecasted 2023 sales of $35mm, Supercom is worth \~$7.00 per share. As investor confidence in the story builds, we would not be surprised with additional multiple expansion. Of course, a large contract would accelerate its path toward our price target and justify a higher price. As such, we are confident in establishing Supercom as a 33% position.

Yes I’ve had multiple bangers lucky me on $FCEL and $BNGO

FCEL

BNGO

I am lucky to have some college friends who are at Scripps (internal med Dr), Illumina (Data Scientist), Stanford (anesthesiologist), USC general hospital (Surgeon). They all only have FAANG stocks but helps me do my DD.

Now back to Rigel, this company has been Solid gain for me for last 2 months slow but surely. When my friends helps me I provide 50+ pharma companies and they look at Clinical trial data to see if pre to phases are promising, next product market size, the competitors, and the management.

RIGL has multiple bangers here, Rigel Pharmaceuticals is aiming its immune thrombocytopenic purpura treatment Tavalisse (fostamatinib) at COVID-19. Rigel has initiated a Phase II study for Tavalisse that is being supported by the National Institutes of Health. The primary endpoint of this study is cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) through day 29, with multiple secondary endpoints designed to assess the early efficacy and clinically relevant endpoints of disease course as well as in vitro biological correlatives evaluating the effects of the drug on pathways involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Topline data from the study is expected in April.

Additionally, Rigel launched a Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tavalisse in hospitalized COVID-19 patients without respiratory failure that have certain high-risk prognostic factors. moderna or Pfizer vaccine is to prevent contracting Covid, which mNRA is completely useless after having COVID-19.

If you read above statement, RIGEL is also supported by NIH (National Institutes of Health)

Recently Department of Defense funded RIGEL for clinical testing on Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK).

After learning about Citadel involvement with GME short, I looked into XSPA institution filing and saw they are in XSPA along with Sabby and Intracoastal.

Unbelievable. They are shorting a covid testing company during THE PANDEMIC and profiting from it.

* 11 locations (7 already opened )
* 3 partnership JetBlue, Hawaiian, United airline
* Collaboration with Delta and KLM airline for transatlantic testing
* Rapid testing 15 minutes testing
* 100 millions cash and likely 133 millions after warrants exercise.
* Hawaii approved lab
* International testing recently required 1/26
* Domestic testing and funding being considered

I hope all shorts hedge funds and Robinhood get burn.

I hope Reddit can unite against the establishment especially a covid testing company XSPA.

Let's see they try to halt a testing company. They will get alot of bad press and require an inquiry into these short hedge funds.  


XSPA is also expanding their covid testing businesses as Joe Biden made it mandatory to do covid testing for flights.  CEO mentioned on a couple occasions that they are in communications with Biden’s team.

2021-01-28,Catalyst for SENS This Weekend,"Catalyst for SENS This Weekend  Hi All figured it was worth mentioning to those who still message me about it.[ In my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/l3eywq/late_night_deep_dive_into_sensonics_upcoming/) I talk about the distribution rights transfer of Senseonics Eversense system from Roche to PHC Holdings.

[On January 31st, this Sunday. Asensia (PHC Holdings), one of the largest distributors and manufacturers of BGM systems in Europe and Asia will take over distribution from Roche](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/senseonics-180-day-eversense-glucose-monitor-delayed-at-fda-by-covid-19-pandemic) who has already developed a huge market in multiple regions over the last 5 years.

[Here is a quick list of the regions that Roche/Senseonic have had eyes on since their partnership in 2016.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1616543/000155837017000899/sens-20161231ex10288bb2d.htm)

[Each Company still holds a major stake in Senseonic, PHC Holdings owns a quarter of the company while Roche is still invested in one fifth. Oh and Evil George Soros is involved /s.](https://fintel.io/so/us/sens) It would obviously be to each advantage to see a smooth transition of the distribution and I believe they have already been in the works. This is a fairly big deal as Roche’s last move was into the Asian market but since PHC is already there, it will be a quick and easy demographic to take over. In the international market the 180 CGM system from Senseonic is already available and I think the 365 system is the next target, at least on the international front. I don't think netting 180 million in capital before this move is a small sign.

Let me know what you guys think, thanks!

Additionally, Ring has closed its Andrews, Texas field office, downsized its Midland office and will be closing its Tulsa office at the end of the first quarter 2021. These initiatives will result in meaningful annual general and administrative (“G&A”) cost savings as the Company is decreasing its overall office space and lease costs.

Mr. Paul D. McKinney, Ring’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, stated, “We are implementing a new strategic vision for Ring and relocating our headquarters to The Woodlands is one of the key first steps in this process. We wanted to reduce our fixed G&A costs, while increasing our accessibility to the diverse and experienced energy workforce in the greater Houston area, and this move accomplishes both objectives. In addition, we are consolidating all of our executive management team and relocating all accounting functions into our new Woodlands headquarters. The combination of these actions is expected to result in a 15 percent annualized office-related G&A cost savings. We look forward to continuing to lower our break-even costs while increasing our free cash flow generation with our long-lived conventional assets in the heart of the Permian Basin.”",0.0,Neutral,English

$AMPE broke out of a bullish pennant for a leg up. def worth watching. they’re making a covid related medication

$ITP $NBY Biden signs order requiring masks on planes, buses, trains and at airports. These are mask plays and will catch some hits as more news becomes available. Masks are also mandated on federal property as well. These executed orders come as close to a national mask mandate as his federal powers may allow, leaving it to states and municipalities to require residents to wear masks at a local level.

$NVIV - Compliance was reached at close Friday. News should come this week. This easily could be $4-$5 by end of week if news hits. Regardless even without news this likely gets to $3 by end of week.

2021-01-21,DD on $NOK by /u/jbow234,"DD on $NOK by /u/jbow234  

>The Finnish state is buying shares of [Nokia Oyj](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NOKIA:FH) to send a signal that it’s ready to protect the maker of 5G mobile networks amid a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. has expressed interest in owning a part of the company.  
The state’s equity-asset manager Solidium Oy recently crossed the 5% threshold in Nokia shares, and now has about 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) worth of stock

Even if you ignore the fact that it's grossly undervalued given their cash flow, even if you ignore they are the major player in 5G space and are already making billions in patent royalty a year.

Let's put all that a side for a second. The new national security concerns after the major Russian Hack and Chinese compromised hardware will continue to become top priority for many countries. NOK is a MOON stock in the making.

* Finland is bidding the stock up to retain ownership and to prevent acquisition.
* Nokia itself has so much cash it has also been buying back back shares and will continue to do so. We are at the lows!
* Now USA is trying to buy stakes now that it's dumping Huawei.

Also since I expect people talking about the 5 billion shares outstanding. Yes but realize its a $4 stock, the average buys are much larger orders. Also for reference apple has 16 billion shares.

The 5G play just started this year with the release of Apple's first 5G phone, sorry for those who invested too early the years prior and got burned.

2021-01-21,🚨 In-Depth DD on $ATOS and its January 26th COVID updates at the Public Medicine World Conference (my view on why the price is moving),"🚨 In-Depth DD on $ATOS and its January 26th COVID updates at the Public Medicine World Conference (my view on why the price is moving) What's **Atossa Therapeutics** ?

""Atossa Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company seeking to discover and develop innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need. Atossa’s current focus is on breast cancer and COVID-19. **We believe our innovative therapies and delivery methods can benefit COVID-19** patients and transform breast cancer treatment – with the goal of preventing breast cancer from developing in the first place"" I will try to focus on a **possible near term catalyst** for the stock, which is about their **Covid Nasal Spray**, but their breast cancer treatments in the pipeline are also worth mentioning and researching for sure. 

[remember this face](https://preview.redd.it/e66596f5qnc61.png?width=2516&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ed8418d2b4ebe9648841ed83bcb6196a223622b)

&#x200B;

They currently have 2 COVID-19 therapeutic programs under development, **one for severely ill patients on ventilators and another for at-home use in patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization**.

What should we be excited about? 

Well, their current Nasal Spray with **AT301** is intended for at-home use to **proactively reduce symptoms of COVID-19**and to slow the infection rate so that a person’s immune system can more effectively fight SARS-CoV-2.  Atossa plans to identify potential partners who are developing COVID-19 diagnostic tests so that AT-301 nasal spray may be co-developed and commercialized with the goal of making the AT-301 therapy available at the time a person tests positive for the coronavirus. Atossa also plans to develop its nasal spray to potentially **help prevent COVID-19 infection -- particularly for people in high risk environments -- including, for example, people living with a patient infected with COVID-19, healthcare workers, emergency responders and teachers**.

I looked for updates from official sources after the study completion and nothing popped up. What popped up instead, was actually a conference by PMWC (**Precision Medicine World Conference**) for January 26th [https://twitter.com/PMWCintl](https://twitter.com/PMWCintl) .

**TARGET PRICE 5$**. yes. They have been doing direct offerings at market price in their recent past, which in my opinion is a good sign. They sold shares directly to institutions without discounting them. Remember the date, **January 26th** for the conference and updates on AT301 (possibly?). As you can see the stock seems to be moving, the more we get closer to that date.

🚨 **Keep in mind mines is just speculation about what's going to happen, I do not have any medical background, I'm just trying to connect the dots**. Balance sheet is negative (like 99% of pennystocks) I'm not concerned though because I'm not planning to hold long term. I'm opening up a small position and see how things will turn out next week. What do you guys think? Everything I've written is linked from official websites, from the Clinical Trial results to the target price from analysts. I try my best as always to bring useful informations out, **I invite you to do your own research and be aware of all the risks involved investing in pennystocks**. Huge upside, huge downside. **YOU DECIDE IF IT'S WORTH IT OR NOT, YOU ARE THE BEST JUDGE ON YOUR NEXT MOVE** . ***Don't let me or other posters influence your decisions***. I'd like to hear your thoughts, let me know also about the negative aspects related to this stock since I'm keen to learn more everyday. **Thanks**. 🚨

Covid Stocks

$SRNE - Shares of Sorrento are trading higher today after the company said it would present preliminary data from an ongoing SARS-CoV2 mutation surveillance program for its neutralizing antibodies currently in clinical and pre-clinical development for treatment of patients with Covid-19 disease. 4 hour ultimate moving average just crossed the golden cross moving average and printed a ""long"" today. This company is going to be relevant for its STI-2020 antibody which is currently in clinical trials, especially if it behaves the same way toward the new virus variant expected to be the dominant virus by March. Price Target $12.80

$HUGE - Company is testing FSD201 COVID-19 Trial which will test length of time of fever, oxygen saturation, clinical progression, time to mechanical ventilation or hospitalization, and length of hospital stay. The exploratory endpoint is cytokine clearance as measured by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. The treatment period is 14 days and the primary endpoint is determined at 28 days. That means we are expecting this company to drop news about their trial any day now. The chart looks primed for a ""HUGE"" run and there is excellent volume entering the stock. With good results this can run hard to $9. With mediocre results it can go to $3.80.

$HTBX - Currently focused on treating multiple oncology product candidates and a novel COVID-19 vaccine. Yesterday they announced they transferred its gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine cell line to Waisman Biomanufacturing to initiate a manufacturing process for ZVX-60 (the vaccine cell line). It is being developed for either a standalone vaccine or a combination vaccine to enhance prophylactic protection against COVID-19. This manufacturing news is big! It means they already know there is demand for their product. A daily buy arrow was printed on supertrend and the 2 hour ultimate moving average is about to cross the golden cross average line. Just broke through major resistance. This is going to run soon. Price Target $11

TECHNICALS:

$OPTT – Golden Crosson as of 1/19/21

$CIDM - Cup and handle on the daily with a measured move to $2. Stock was up 40% today. Looking for major continuation moving forward here. Today Cinedigm announced that it has acquired Fandor, a subscription streaming service, with plans to relaunch indie film service which closed its doors in 2018. Cinedigm believes they could top 1 million subscribers within 24-30 months. The fandor acquisition solidifies Cinedigm's postion as THE leading global streaming company for independent films. Referenced as ""the Netflix of Indie.""

$EQ - Initial product candidate, itolizumab, is a first-in-class immune-modifying monoclonal antibody that targets the CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway. The CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway plays a central role in the modulation of effector T cells (Teff cells). Activated Teff cells drive a number of immuno-inflammatory diseases across therapeutic areas including transplant science, systemic autoimmunity, pulmonary, neurologic, gastrointestinal, renal, vascular, ophthalmic and dermatologic disorders. Therefore, we believe itolizumab may have broad therapeutic utility in treating a large and diverse set of severe immuno-inflammatory diseases. 2 hour chart ultimate moving average just crossed over the golden cross indicator and printed a ""long."" This most likely has a PR coming soon about its prime candidate. Price Target: $8.98

$TBLT - OFFERING announced today. Look for a short term pull back to $0.90-95 (old resistance). Weekly buy arrow just printed on the supertrend. Resistance since June 2020 was just broken last week. The daily ultimate moving average just crossed over the golden cross indicator today, implying to me that this recent move is just the beginning for TBLT. Great swing opportunity here after the offering is complete that was announced today and it pulls back to test new support level. The company is now roughly 2 years away from profitability. Market will anticipate the future new earnings.

$BORR on a healthy pull back. Support seems to have been found around .88-.89. If my calculations are correct. With current ROC we should see a nice run incoming from imminent MA golden cross on the daily chart. There are indications that this move can fail. Def worth watching. I have PT 1.40-1.80-2.40

$KODK - MACD and RSI for any potential breakouts. Watching $8.90 area for a range break. Bullish trend

$AAPL - “Apple’s stock is not detached from a realistic outlook on the future of the business (excluding an Apple Car). If anything, the stock may continue to be a bargain.

While Apple’s stock trades at a premium relative to its five-year average price-to-earnings multiple, at 32 times estimated earnings the stock trades well below comparable multiples for Amazon (58 times) and Netflix (57 times). And of course, Apple shares trade below the 204 times forward price-to-earnings multiple on electric vehicle favorite Tesla (TSLA).” PT: $150 by the end of March.

$BORR - currently on a pullback. and looks to be ready for a bounce. this stock has been showing strong signs of wanting to keep running.

$CDR - recent [r/S](https://www.reddit.com/r/S/) analysts have a high PT for this stick. 3 white soldiers on the daily with a continuation candle. further movements up can be expected

$SGBX - golden cross occurred recently. they should be highly involved in the mobilization of covid vaccine locations by the govt as part of Bidens first 10 days

$KIQ - Double bottom on the daily with a huge volume spike last week. Looking for an initial move to $0.98 then a breakout move to about $2 from a weekly cup and handle play. Kelso Technologies is a railway equipment supplier that produces and sells tank car service equipment used for the safe loading and unloading of hazardous materials during transport. As more and more plays under a dollar start to take off, there are only a few left with significant volume. This is one of them. And with a CEO by the name of James Bond, how can you resist?

$VIXY - Bullish divergence on the awesome oscillator, elliot wave moving higher, and volume increasing. Weekly MACD is about to cross. Tens of thousands of armed troops at the capitol to swear in Biden. FBI reports of armed protests all over the country. Government spending at an all time high. Stock market hasn't had a pullback in a while. Reports of arrests being made world wide for corruption and fraud. VIXY could see a return back to the resistance at $35 this week.

$NBY – The new administration will order mandatory mask by the spring. Resistance at $1.10. - Short term PT 1.26 Long swing $2.96

$WWR - Pennant formation set to break any day now. In my opinion there will be a PR released soon to

break the pennant. Oversold on the monthly with RSI at 32. The Pilot Plant Progress is a study demonstration to produce battery-grade graphite for the growing EV (Electric Vehicle) and other battery markets. Graphite is essential to battery

construction, and there are no domestic US sources for this important material, besides WWR. This could

be a monopoly for them. Company expects the remaining stages of the purification of graphite to be

finishing by the this month! Huge PR coming soon, and with the pennant, I'm guessing it is any day now.

2021-01-17,Biggest Stock Market Lessons of 2020,"Biggest Stock Market Lessons of 2020 **Just published a new blog covering some of the most valuable lessons from the market throughout 2020! Give it a read and let me know your thoughts:**

2020 has been a wild year in both everyday life and the stock market! We've seen the entire market crash and then recover to new all-time highs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen entire sectors of the market *(healthcare/vaccination, electric vehicle, energy, marijuana, etc.)* go completely parabolic, and we've seen some serious pump and dumps of 200%, 500%, and even 1,000% or more in a single day.

All of this volatility in 2020 gave us some incredible money-making opportunities and, whether you were able to capitalize on them or not, it also reinforced some very valuable stock market lessons that can be used going into the new year. The rest of this post will dedicated to those stock market lessons. *Keep in mind that, even though history often repeats itself, these lessons may not be as accurate under different market conditions.*

&#x200B;

**1. Buy. The. F\*cking. Dip.**

Realistically I could probably end it here because if 2020 taught me anything it's to buy the dip! This year it happened to be a little bit more than just a dip, with the S&P 500 *(and its ETF equivalent $SPY)* dropping about 35% from its high due to worldwide economic shutdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic. It only took about 5 months for the S&P 500 to completely recover up to its previous high, which it ended up soaring past. Anyone that bought the dip would have been rewarded nicely, which historically has always been the case when dip buying the S&P.

Additionally, countless individual stocks also plummeted during this period, even though many of them hadn't been directly affected by the pandemic. These stocks also made great dip buys and, as you can see from their charts below, offered some incredible investment opportunities from their lows in March:

[https://imgur.com/a/L8TSm1j](https://imgur.com/a/L8TSm1j) *(Amazon $AMZN)*

[https://imgur.com/a/MIdwzDf](https://imgur.com/a/MIdwzDf) *(Apple $AAPL)*

[*https://imgur.com/a/WCTMqB0*](https://imgur.com/a/WCTMqB0) *(Tesla $TSLA)*

&#x200B;

**2. Don't underestimated pump and dumps!**

Pump and dumps are a huge part of the stock market and, specifically, the penny stock market. They happen when groups of traders, such as large chatrooms or alert services, simultaneously begin to promote and buy the same stocks. Eventually, the pumpers cash out with nice profits while other traders that chased at the highs are left with a loss when the stocks gets dumped back down to reality.Although trading them sounds a bit sketchy, there are many ways to make a lot of money with pump and dumps. If you can spot them early enough, you can ride their momentum and sell for a nice profit before the dump. Alternatively, you can wait for the pumping to end and the dumping to begin to short-sell them and profit from them coming back down. However, with this type of trading strategy you have to be extra cautious that you're short-selling the reversal, not just a temporary dip.

2020 has shown the importance of not underestimating pump and dumps and avoiding being an early short-seller. Otherwise, you can easily end up wiping out your trading account if you get caught in a short position in a stock being pumped 500% or even 1,000% or more like we saw this year with $WEI, for example.

&#x200B;

**3. Invest in sympathy plays**

The market has had no shortage of sympathy plays over the past year, and hopefully the same will be true in 2021! Sympathy plays are simply stocks that spike for no reason other than their relation to another stock that is already spiking. Usually sympathy plays fall into the same sector as the leading stock/company and will have similarly priced stocks. A great example of this is the electric vehicle section of the market. Of course, the most well-known company in this category is Tesla *($TSLA)*, but because of the overall popularity of electric vehicles in 2020 there's been countless other companies that have jumped into the electric vehicle market just to take advantage of the momentum!

These sympathy plays may not be as reputable or as investment worthy as the sector leader, but when there's a sector with a ton of hype around it, you can make a killing by hopping into some of the lesser-known companies early on.

A quick and easy *(and free)* way to get an overview of which sectors have been performing the best lately is to go to finviz.com and select ""Groups"" at the top. This will show how different sectors of the market have been performing over multiple timeframes such as the past 1 day, the past 1 week, the past 1 month, etc.

[https://imgur.com/a/gdHtOXy](https://imgur.com/a/gdHtOXy)

&#x200B;

**4. Don't fight the trend**

If you've been trading or studying the market for awhile, odds are that you've heard this rule. This is just a friendly reminder to trade the trend... **not** fight it! The reason this was such an important lesson from 2020 is because of the overall market. After the initial ""crash"" in March, seemingly everyone was expecting a 2nd crash to come shortly after everything in the market started to recover. This led to a lot of traders and investors taking losses when they tried to short-sell into the bounce, with the expectation that their short positions would profit from the market making new lows. In other words, they fought the trend.

With the market trending strongly in either direction lately, it's more important than ever to avoid fighting the trend. This means that you're better off buying into upward momentum than you are trying to buy at the exact bottom when there's a downtrend. The same is true for short-selling... you're better off short-selling into weakness than you are trying to short-sell at the exact high of a stock the is uptrending.

Best wishes with your trading and investing in this new year! Hopefully if 2020 wasn't a major success you are able to learn from some of the many lessons that this year has taught us and have a record-breaking 2021.",0.0,Neutral,English

What's **Senseonics**?

Senseonics is a medical device startup company in USA developing transformative ***glucose monitoring*** products that are intended to enable people with **diabetes** to confidently live their lives with ease. Utilizing breakthrough fluorescence sensing technology, the Senseonics continuous glucose monitoring (""**CGM**""​) system is being designed to be the **first** fully implantable CGM that is highly accurate and stable throughout its long sensor life. The system consists of **a very small sensor** implanted under the skin, **an external transmitter**, and **a mobile medical application**, which allows for discreet, easy access to real-time glucose measurements without the need for a dedicated receiver.

To get an idea, here are the pictures directly from their [website](https://www.eversensediabetes.com/eversense-cgm-system) :

Being able to have real-time data and alerts about glucose levels can be life saving, keep in mind **Diabetes** is the **nation’s** **seventh-leading** **cause of death**, accounting for more than 79,000 deaths annually. It also [contributes to deaths from heart disease and stroke](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/diabetes/why-diabetes-matters/cardiovascular-disease--diabetes) which are the leading and fifth-leading causes of death, respectively. There are three major [types of diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/quick-facts.html): type 1, type 2, and gestational. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases.

RENEWABLE ENERGY/EV: HOT SECTOR – waiting for Biden plan

$WWR - Pennant formation set to break any day now. In my opinion there will be a PR released soon to break the pennant. Oversold on the monthly with RSI at 32. There was also a bid for 170,000 shares right around closing today. The Pilot Plant Progress is a study demonstration to produce battery-grade graphite for the growing EV (Electric Vehicle) and other battery markets. Graphite is essential to battery construction, and there are no domestic US sources for this important material, besides WWR. This could be a monopoly for them. Company expects the remaining stages of the purification of graphite to be finishing by the this month! Huge PR coming soon, and with the pennant, I'm guessing it is any day now.

“With the S&P 500 just 0.6% below its recent all-time closing high, investors have largely looked through the recent political turmoil in Washington, D.C. The House of Representatives is preparing to vote as soon as Wednesday over whether to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time during his presidency for “incitement of insurrection” after last week’s riots at the U.S. Capitol. Any impeachment proceedings, however, could pull focus away from President-elect Joe Biden’s agenda in his first days in office – and importantly for markets, potentially impact the timeline for the passage of another stimulus package, some strategists noted.

Strategists and traders have overwhelmingly assumed that another large stimulus package will come about under the Biden administration and unified Democratic government. These prospects, along with the Federal Reserve’s still very easy accommodative monetary policy posturing, have helped buoy equities even given the ongoing pandemic and slow vaccine roll-out to date. On Tuesday alone, both St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in separate public remarks that they believed it was too soon to even begin talking about shrinking the size of the central bank’s asset purchases, which are currently taking place at a $120 billion monthly…:Emily McCormick

$IDEX - WAVE wireless charging technology is most definitely going to be a highly sought after technology moving forward in the EV space. Also a blockchain play which even though is dipping is still over $30k, which would have been a dream just a few weeks ago to Bitcoin miners. Had 175 million shares trade in volume on Friday. With a current market cap of just $742 million, IDEX still looks to be the most undervalued EV player on the NASDAQ, especially when you consider that Nikola still has a $7 billion market cap and is nothing more than a business plan. IDEX just acquired 100% of privately held Timios Holdings Corp. in an all-cash deal. Timios currently has 285 employees and operations in 44 states and has booked over $60 million in YTD revenues, including over $8 million in October 2020. Ideanomics increased its stake in California-based Solectrac. With this investment in Solectrac, Ideanomics expands its global footprint in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, specifically in the category of specialty commercial vehicles. We see IDEX taking one or more of its EV divisions public via IPO or SPAC. This makes a lot of sense as there are two divisions – electric vehicles and fintech. At current levels, both divisions are tremendously undervalued. This is a long term holder here. Should be around $10 in the not too distant future.

So, between here and Discord, at least 4 people have mentioned their Robinhood accounts had been taken over since Saturday. How? [Same as before](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/):

 1. your email account is targeted first; they log in because you have a weak password (I suppose it could also be a [normal breach elsewhere combined with password reuse](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) but everyone willing to tell me said it was just a short or weak password...)
 2. filters to hide emails from Robinhood are added to the email account
 3. a password reset request is sent to Robinhood
 4. the email from Robinhood is intercepted and they click the link to change the password
 5. now that they can log in to Robinhood, they liquidate your account (you'll likely get push notifications as they do this but cannot stop them because you're logged out when the password changed)
 6. your Cash Management card (which they'll even sign up for if you haven't already) is used to make large purchases with vendors that might also be compromised. Last year, they were using the POS systems of a construction company in Virginia and a charity (info which I passed on to the Richmond, VA Field Office) as well as Revolut (a PayPal/Venmo type company that allows you to fund your account with *any* debit card even if it doesn't match your name or billing address) to send money transfers through Eastern Europe. This time, I've seen large purchases online with SNKRDUNK SHIBUYA, a sneakerhead shop in Japan.

If your account is compromised, it will take weeks or months for Robinhood to get back to you and you will be locked out of the account the entire time. To state the obvious, you do not want that! Remember, the 'hacker' (which if you have your dog's name and the number five as your password, it's not much of a hack) has already been in touch with Robinhood and made changes to your account from your email address so they'll have a hard time being absolutely positive you are you.

How to prevent it:
 
 - Change your email password! **This is how they're getting in!**
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Don't choose passwords because they are 'easy to remember' or 'easy to type' (all signs pointed to this being the biggest problem last year; people were using names and dates, etc. Real 90s era security...)
 - Enable 2FA on your email account (if possible) and on Robinhood
 - Check your email account for any filters that may have been added by someone who isn't you
 - Check your email often! If you placed an order and didn't get an email about it, **check your email filters**!
 - Check for any devices connected to your Robinhood account that are not yours (somewhere in Account Settings). Even if the location matches where you live/work! If you have only used Robinhood on your iPhone and a laptop, there should only be two devices listed!
 - If your email provider has a list of logged in devices, check that too!

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j7dqpc/if_your_robinhood_account_has_been_hacked_please/), Robinhood [mysteriously asked me to not talk about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/j81vlq/followup_to_my_if_your_robinhood_account_has_been/) which was strange seeing as a) they weren't being hacked so their own security wasn't at risk, b) everyone willing to talk to me had already be compromised (some had even already been made whole by Robinhood), and c) letting people know what is happening and how can prevent more of their own customers from being hacked. It literally costs them money, time, and reputation *not* telling people what's going on. Fucking dumb, right?

2021-04-18,Peloton (PTON) - A Hardware or Software Play (Full DD),"Peloton (PTON) - A Hardware or Software Play (Full DD)  **Overview**

We all know Peloton as the popular home-workout brand. Is the company purely a covid play or were they always destined for success? WallStreet seems to valuate the company as a low-margin hardware company, but should that really be the case? We’ll go through some of the ins and outs of the company’s metrics, potential risks, catalysts, and a look at the company’s growth as the world re-opens from lockdowns.

**Covid play or is this the new trend?**

It could be debated that Peloton would not be where they are today without covid and the global lockdowns that occurred. However, were they truly a covid play or did the virus simply speed up the process of them becoming a home-workout powerhouse? The world is re-opening, but demand for their bikes are still at peak. The CEO noted in their latest earnings call (Feb-04-2021) that even with the vaccine roll-out demand for the bike has not decreased.

“We still have not seen any softening since that vaccine was announced and since the vaccine has been rolling out. We haven't seen any softening of demand.”

A look at Google search trends for the term “Peloton” as well as their traffic estimation from high-end SEO tools would also suggest that demand has remained consistent.

https://preview.redd.it/pu09rcxfvxt61.png?width=2306&format=png&auto=webp&s=08832587d10645ce7759e2cac9bc76d177236eff

https://preview.redd.it/s3bbvwrgvxt61.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a0edcf69aa5f747bf97d01de0ef1d317e25bc6a

&#x200B;

Peloton has been accurate with their next-quarter guidance and they’ve been beating estimates consistently, but they seem to slightly sand-bag full-year guidance creating “easy beats”. Let’s go through a few factors that make Peloton the strong company that they are, and a deep dive into some of the growth they can expect post-covid.

**Brand Loyalty** 

Peloton has succeeded in becoming the go-to name for in-home cycling classes, and as they expand, the in-home workout leader. Their brand-loyalty also rivals some of the best of the best. When looking at the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is a ranking of brand loyalty, Peloton has a score in the high 90’s which is a greater score than BOTH Apple and Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/yyuwhwehvxt61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd6838be56deb1e3f136871b78d6b2b8e0a8edb

This is attributed to the high-quality content the company pushes to end-users through their pre-recorded and live classes. Users always have plenty of options when it comes to taking classes with their favorite instructors. Their NPS score is even more evident with the churn-rate Peloton experiences on memberships. Is the churn-rate really that important? In this industry, yes, and in my opinion this is what will differentiate Peloton as more of a tech valuation instead of “just” a hardware company.

To give you reference of how good Peloton’s churn rate is, let’s compare it to Apple TV+ and Netflix. First, the “churn” is the rate of attrition the company experiences over a time-period. Basically it means how often they are **losing** customers. AppleTV+ has a [20% churn rate](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/), which is quite high, while Netflix has a [churn rate of 3%](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/). So what was Peloton’s churn rate last quarter? 0.76%, some of the lowest levels in *any* industry. The company has consistently had churn under 1% since the Pandemic began, and they expect churn to remain under 0.80% for the foreseeable future. You must remember that this number affects the *recurring revenue* source for the company, which is critical for them.

**Big revenue growth, almost no profits. What gives?**

While it’s true that Peloton has been having blow-out quarter after blow-out quarter, they have just barely been profitable. Last quarter (Q2-2021), they did a mere $63.6 million of net income [**on over a billion in revenue**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549). Doesn’t look great from the outside, but we have to remember that this company has been selling every single bike they’ve ever produced and can barely keep up with the high demand over the last 4 quarters. They’ve invested aggressively into the expansion of their [**supply chain infrastructure**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/peloton-production-capacity-factory/585057/) and recently they [**acquired Precor**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor), another fitness chain with strong connections to hotels and gyms, for $420 million. The Precor acquisition will substantially increase domestic manufacturing capabilities for their bike and tread product. Here’s a look at the current OTD (order-to-delivery) times within the USA, from the Peloton website.

https://preview.redd.it/kwnbtizivxt61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=e96981504fb19209f11e56ef8bd49795c8d5eaf0

We can see that even after exponentially increasing their production capacity over the last year customers still need to wait weeks or months to receive the product. Peloton has been working hard to get delivery times down to the desired 1-2 weeks. Management noted that with these aggressive supply chain investments they will be able to get there by Q3 or Q4, 2021. Management commented on OTD times in their last earnings call.

“the successes that we're seeing in getting the order to delivery down and getting our backlog down are 100% based on incredible upgrades, and our manufacturing capacity up to over six times -- 6x increase in just the last 12 months in our capacity of them know -- we're now making more Bikes on a monthly basis than we did in all of fiscal 2018”

Due to covid there’s been a lot of delays (unloading times 4x longer than a year ago) at the west coast port-of-entry that has forced Peloton to re-schedule many deliveries. Another reason why net profits have been affected to such an extant is that Peloton has already started what they expect to be over 100 million expenditure in expediting shipments using more expensive methods (air freight). From the CC:

“Though we're beginning to see the benefits of our extensive supply chain investments, our delivery wait times remain elevated… we are investing over $100 million in expedited shipping to reduce the wait times for our products.

But what I can say is that we do expect that this $100 million, which we recognize is a very large investment. We believe will get us back to normal shipping protocol by the end of this fiscal year… the expedited shipping investment brings down OTD. And that gets inventory into warehouses, which is going to allow us to get aggressive with marketing really for the first time”

**Risks to the downside**

I’m seeing a few notable risks that might have a negative effect on the company. I’ll go through them here:

**Cheaper Competition:** we have a less “premium” brand also entering the scene with NordicTrack now providing similar products at a much lower cost.

**Long delivery times:** It’s only natural that when you go to the checkout page for your brand new Peloton bike and see a delivery time of nearly 2-3 months you might be turned away to a competitor (such as the NordicTrack, ProForm, or SoulCycle bike). However, like we mentioned earlier is that Peloton has extremely high brand loyalty. People want a Peloton, just like they prefer Apple iPhone over Samsung (or vice versa), or Lululemon clothing instead of the off-brand (and much cheaper) at Walmart.

**Re-opening risks:** As the world re-opens the risk of churn becomes higher as well. However, it is my opinion that gym-goers will maintain both their gym membership as well as their Peloton membership. This is not a “one or the other” case. I would not be surprised if Peloton subscriber churn rate stayed under 1% as everything re-opens. A risk to the company none-the-less.

**Low-margin equipment sales:** Back in August 2020, Peloton CEO noted that each bike is sold at nearly break-even, meaning they don’t make any money on the sale. The true net-profit will be locking the user into the Peloton content ecosystem. He also stated that due to the economies of scale they are creating that eventually (and most likely already), they will be making a profit on each bike sold. He also mentions on the Q1 2021 earnings call that both the original Bike and the Bike+ have extremely similar margins. Peloton doesn’t disclose the specific mix of their products that attribute to revenues and how many treads were sold vs bikes vs Bike+, but I think it’s safe to assume that each of their products will have similar margins.

**Freight Pricing Pressure:** This has been quite a challenge for the company. They’ve been maneuvering through logistics issues and have dedicated $100 million to reducing the OTD times to keep new customers happy. Due to covid, this freight pricing pressure might continue for the rest of the year and possibly longer. Management has noted that their forward guidance does already include these inefficiencies, which is obvious because the company’s growth in 2020 would have been much stronger had it been able to fulfill every single order it had on the books.

**Over-investment into supply chain:** There are also some risks associated with all these supply chain investments the company is making. Right now it seems like a smart play to keep up with the demand of bikes and treads, but at what cost? 420 million Precor acquisition, an extra 100 million investment in expediting shipments, further investments into their Taiwan manufacturing site are all cutting deeply into margins. There is risk that 2-3 years from now they have more supply than demand and the question of the validity of these supply-chain investments may come up. However, in my opinion, Peloton management has been doing a great job at managing the difficulties not only with logistics through covid, but also with the explosive growth the company has seen.

**Potential Catalysts**

**International Expansion**

Until now Peloton has been laser-focused on the U.S market. They’ve been slowly [expanding into Europe and Canada](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-expands-to-europe-and-canada-300644577.html), and have just recently opened up the tread market in United Kingdom. From their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had some positive comments to say about European markets:

“U.K. Tread sales have exceeded our expectations, and our early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive.”

The demand for Peloton is highest in the United States at the moment, but that doesn’t go to say the product can’t succeed internationally. In my opinion, *when* demand in the U.S starts to decrease it will be off-set by the increase of growth in international markets.

**More on the Precor Acquisition**

Going back a bit more on the Precor acquisition. This was a strategic move by management and will have a two-fold positive effect on the company. The first is that delivery times will finally be shortened with the wide manufacturing footprint that will be created in the U.S. This will also alleviate stress of high shipping costs that the company has incurred. The Precor deal and having a U.S based factory should lead to better performance for Peloton’s bottom line. Second, Precor has very good relationships with channels that Peloton has not yet penetrated. This will help Peloton gain instant-access to some very lucrative end-markets, which include schools, clubs, hotels, and gyms. When asked about the Precor acquisition on their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had to say:

“it's been enormous curiosity about what this could mean in terms of delivering a combined Precor Peloton experience in the commercial channel”

They want to get Peloton into all these channels and the possibilities are endless.

**Economies of Scale**

It’s evident the company has been bogged down by extensive costs and “growing pains”. They’ve maneuvered through the Pandemic and are meeting extremely high demand by spending a lot more on shipping and getting product from their factory in Taiwan to the warehouse in the United States. They also have large expenditures on creating content, hiring instructors, and maintaining the quality of product. All this to keep users engaged. With the Precor acquisition, these expenses will become a lower percent of the revenue generated as margins are increased and revenue increases.

**Valuation**

There are quite a few topics I want to touch base on in terms of the company’s valuation. I think if we were to use a benchmark of value, we could look at Nautilus Inc (NLS), which is a fitness equipment manufacturing company, is currently trading at 1x trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenues… On the other side of things, you have tech stocks trading at incredibly high valuations all because they are bringing in high-margin recurring revenue. So the debate will be low-margin hardware versus high-margin recurring revenue. Peloton fits somewhere in the middle.

WallStreet’s main concerns for Peloton are going to be over the company’s margins, and the longevity of the increased “covid” demand. The big question is, what happens when demand slows? After-all, the market is a forward-looking. I want to look at this in two ways. The first is going to be international expansion off-setting a slow in growth in the United States. The second is going to be a look at the recurring revenues and continued subscriber growth over the next 2-3 years.

**Demand**

As with any product, the demand for Peloton products will eventually plateau. Peloton has done well by releasing the new treadmill product, with rumors of a rowing machine and other in-home fitness equipment. I would not be surprised to see Peloton develop a very robust product line. However, as growth slows in one segment (bikes) a new segment will open up (tread/rower/other products). With 2 million in cash on the balance sheet Peloton is in a great position to expand their brand into other segments both in the domestic USA and internationally.

Peloton’s expansion internationally is still in the very early stages as they’ve only just began to penetrate these markets. Like I touched up on previously, the increased demand internationally will off-set some of the growth slowing in the United States. The end-goal of the company is to increase margins on their hardware products, while selling a lot of it, and then locking users into their ecosystem with the recurring subscription which will be a big money-maker for them.

**Subscriptions**

The subscription revenues, which currently have a 60% gross profit, are going un-noticed with the company’s valuation. In their most recent quarter (Q2-2021) they did over 1.064 billion in revenue. From that revenue, approximately 81.7% came from sales of bikes, treads, and other products in their “connected fitness” segment. The other 18.3% came from subscription revenue. Their “connected fitness” and “subscription revenue” segments also come in with gross profits of 35.3%, and 60.3%, respectively.

Their guidance for Q3-2021 had similar performance to last quarter, where they guided another billion in revenue and an additional 300m subscribers to their network. This is also coming off their holiday season quarter, which generally provides an additional boost in sales. In my opinion, I think it would be safe to assume that continued high demand in the U.S market, with growing international exposure will get the company doing $2 billion in revenue per quarter. Remember that 18.3% of that revenue is recurring from their subscription model. This would generate about $366 million in subscription revenue per quarter, and on a twelve-month basis approximately $1.47 billion per year. Here’s a look at their Q2-2021 revenue and subscriber growth.

https://preview.redd.it/no1s4xkkvxt61.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3d9030c404791abd6563d9ef13c605fd7a20279

Peloton currently has a market cap of $32 billion. *If* the company were to achieve $2 billion revenues per quarter in 1-2 years, which in my opinion is quite probable, then at current valuations they would be trading at 4x sales, with 20% of that coming from recurring subscriptions. Don’t forget they have a strong balance sheet with just over 2 million in cash assets for future investments.

I like the stock and would like to invest in it while it is trading at a market cap below 10-15x revenues. At that same valuation today they would be priced at $180 instead of $110.

**TLDR;**

1. The company has had blowout quarter after blowout quarter, but barely turning a profit. They have been experiencing “growing pains” and invested heavily into their supply chain infrastructure. $420 million Precor acquisition, $100 million in *additional* expedited shipping costs, and digital content production have cut heavily into their margins.
2. They are doing $1 billion revenues per quarter and with steady growth they might get up to $2 billion per quarter in 2022. Approximately 20% of that revenue will be *recurring* revenue from their fitness subscription model. Not only that, but they are also adding 300m new subscribers to their ecosystem each quarter. 
3. With all these supply chain infrastructure upgrades they are still selling every single bike they can produce. Management noted that demand has remained high even with global vaccine roll-outs. They are just getting their feet wet with international markets, which could provide another boost in demand.
4. There are a few concerns about the company moving forward, such as: low margin product, over-investment in new factories and acquisitions, long delivery times turning customers to competitors, and re-opening risks. We’ve addressed these above.
5. If the company can prove they are more than a “hardware” manufacturing company WallStreet will give them the proper valuation. They are currently on track to have over 2m paying members to their integrated fitness model and I would not be surprised if they hit over 3-4 million members by 2022.",0.0,Neutral,English

Ive been able to consistently outperform the market and have always dreamed of taking out a huge personal loan when I turn 18 and put it all in tech stocks, obviously not all at once but you get the idea. Get loan, outperform interest rate, be rich. Can you guys give your own 2 cents on this? Do you believe this is possible if so I want to be the first to pull it off! Thanks",0.0,Neutral,English

2021-10-08,I crossed the finish line but the race wasn't over...,"I crossed the finish line but the race wasn't over... First ever post, I created an account after lurking for a year to share.

I know that everyone enjoys good charts. [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/oBw9iy6) I included my salary progression specifically so that people can get a more accurate idea as to software salary growth rather than thinking that everyone starts at $100k/yr.

**Obligatory Origin Story:**

My financial journey started in my early 20s when I realized that I wanted to RE. I was married with a single child. As a college dropout I had limited job opportunities. My work (call center) was demanding with long hours and very limited upward mobility. I made $24k/yr after overtime.

I missed my kid's milestones, missed holidays, and it was difficult to even take cheap vacations with my friends/family due to work. I decided that this 'working' thing was clearly a fools game. I looked into it and played with online calculators. They showed me that I was going to be working forever. According to conventional wisdom I would need 1-2 million to retire at 70.

I grew up poor and ended up very risk averse with money. This prevented me from making several very bad decisions. I refused to go into debt without a clear plan to get myself out of it. I had refused to do student loans, I had no credit card debt, and I had a paid off car.

*… fast forward nearly a decade*

I worked my way up the call center ($40k/yr). I bought a house near work. I worked full time and went to school full time. I used work's tuition reimbursement to return to college and paid what I could out of pocket. I applied for and received several small scholarships and financial aid. Eventually I graduated college with minimal (20k\~) student loan debt.

I also got divorced.

*Life Tip: Communication naturally breaks down sometimes. Repair it if you can before its too late.*

I ended up with a master's degree, a software engineering job making $60k/yr and (after a few years of spousal support and debt payments) a nearly blank slate in my 30s.

I also by this point had found MMM and learned a lot about personal finance.

**The Goal Line:**

Since I lived on $24k/yr previously, I decided that $600k invested plus a paid off residence was the finish line.

I am not horribly worried about a crap market immediately after I retire. My skills are in high demand and ""I took a couple years to write a novel and take care of my kids"" would not cause me (as a hirer of engineers) to bat an eye. I am hopeful that by the time my skills are too rusty to have an easy return, my nest egg will have grown enough that sequence of return risk will be minimal.

Furthermore I love the idea of taking jobs for periods of time where I am not tied in. Six months working at bakery. Teaching a few semesters at a local college. Something on my feet to keep me from getting lazy around the holidays.

**Accumulation Phase:**

I took the simple path to wealth. I skipped real estate. I avoided side hustles. I didn't start a business or get equity in anything. I worked at a normal W2 job. I got slightly better than average raises and switched employers twice. I never FAANG'd, but my income was and is fantastic for a MCOL location.

I lived on less than I earned and I invested the difference. I maxed my 401k yearly. I maxed my Roth IRA as long as I could. When I had the surplus, I started a brokerage account at Vanguard. Nearly 100% of my money is in index funds.

I remarried and had more children.

My wife is \*not\* a FIRE advocate, but she makes as much as I do, saves more, and has more in assets as well. She could FIRE tomorrow if she so desired. I say all of that to say the important disclaimer: our finances are separate. Her money is hers and is not counted at all in my retirement plans. We share a mortgage, joint accounts for vacations and bills, etc. But the majority of our pay goes to individual accounts and does not comingle.

**Crossing the line:**

Adjusting for inflation from my original 600k number, the finish line was \~$670k. The stock market has been insane over the past couple of years and my savings rate is 70% on a six figure salary. I'm at \~$800k invested.

I didn't stroll over the finish line, I leapt over it. I expected to feel exhilaration. Accomplishment. Balloons and cake and fireworks. Instead it all feels wrong.

I thought that when I retired I would have a community/tribe of like minded people. I thought I would have people to call up for a midweek ""cocktail and laugh at the rat race"". Despite being very social I have been generally unsuccessful at spreading the gospel of FIRE. COVID and a young family has also prevented any real networking.

My mother is in her 60s. I help her with her taxes and recently her budget. She was just forced to move from her rented home of 20 years because the owner is selling. A frank discussion found that she has no savings to speak of, no retirement savings at all, no home equity. Whenever she loses her current job, she is likely to be forced into retirement. Social Security will replace half her income at best and renting in this market is costing her double what she was previously paying. Can I truly quit my cushy job and enjoy my time knowing that she may need financial assistance in the very near future that I would not be able to provide?

Having children has been fantastic but COVID has shown me that I am not going to be happy and fulfilled doing 100% of the childcare. I took months off work when our daycare closed and I treasure that time. But daycare is required for my mental health. I didn't budget at all for daycare post FIRE (which is currently 40k/yr).

We don't fully own our home. We are prepaying a portion of the mortgage per year, so I am \~40k off having that paid off. The kids 529 accounts are not where we would like them. I planned on filling them slowly over the next few years.

MMM and livingafi are my two favorite bloggers in the FIRE community. Both of them got divorced post-retirement. I don't like to think about it, but being honest it would be foolish to \*not\* plan for it at least a little bit. My wife and I have a house together. If we split the value, I could not then purchase a home and keep my budget. Additionally, I am accustomed to the economic benefits of splitting bills and would be shocked to pay a whole electric bill.

My original plan didn't adequately account for healthcare. In my ignorance I thought that I would be able to get healthcare for mere hundreds a month. My wife has no intention to retire and her insurance is adequate for our needs. But relying on her further exacerbates the problems that could occur with a divorce. Or even if she comes around to the idea of FIRE.

My wife has concerns that if lifestyle inflates further (""Why don't we vacation in Spain for the holidays?"") that she will be forced to pay for me/children and significant conflicts will occur in our relationship. What happens when teenagers start eating us out of house and home? What happens when they join sports or need braces?

Further down that line of reasoning, my wife is concerned with the concept of getting off the treadmill and being unable to get back on. ""What happens when your budget is wrong?"" Its easy now to go back to work, but if 15 years from now we end up with medical problems that require lifelong increased expenses we would have no ability to adjust to it.

**Current day:**

I have decided to not get off the treadmill. I am at the top of my career. I reset the finish line in my spreadsheets to $1million. Another year or three should pay off the house, better fund the 529s, reduce the daycare costs, and give me the ability to pay for insurance with invested money. I don't know how to handle my mothers potential needs but I am better situated employed than not. Be that assisting with a home or simply being a check, I cannot do it if I'm not working or better off.

I've lost my passion for FIRE. I have been excited to hit this finish line for nearly 20 years and now all I see are holes in my parachute and no real ability to predict how much is enough. I don't believe this is the ""one more year"" syndrome so much as literal problems that need to be resolved prior to jumping.

I'm hoping that I will regain my fire for FIRE if I look at this as a set back that I can overcome once I spit the sand out of my mouth. ",0.0,Neutral,English

##make your rent, food, and living necessities financially independent of capitalism-based work demand so that you can live purposefully and have 100% control of what cause your effort is contributing to, even in a revenue-based world.

#Rules of the game:
1. Fuck F.I.R.E (the hype, not the philosophy) it’s just an insta-fluencer stupid hashtag
2. You need to make peace with the fact that your plan will take no less than 14-17 years to accomplish if you start now
3. You need to think that your 40s are the new 20s
4. You need to do some math based on your current salary and based on how you want to live when you’re in your 40s
5. You need to make this your absolute utter focus and purpose for the next 17 years. Everything else comes secondary to that.
6. It may help a lot if you let go of the idea of having kids
7. Stop convincing yourself that you can make a difference in the world by a short-sighted goal of working for the “right employer” and doing a job that “helps people” that also happens to pay well. These are extremely rare, and I may even argue they don’t exist. Instead, focus on getting a non-toxic work environment and on shopping industries to find the right skill-to-salary match that works for you

#How to get there: 
##work extra SMART in the next 17 years and retire in your new 20s (40s/50s)
1. Go for the most paying jobs that are not absolute slavery. E.g. (a marketing basic-b**** in a big tech company) with a fancy work MACBOOK and making $110,000 for just being a “cultural fit”
2. Don’t be stupid douche like Jake from Sales and buy a summer house once you close a $3 Million deal for your company and get a $60,000 commission
3. Literally tape on your wall the very amount you need to put in a growing investment vehicle (stock, crypto, whatever the fuck you choose that gives you 5% or more a year) to be reminded of it every day
4. Don’t be a cheap-o and spend on yourself, live with a liberal amount of money and comfort, just be picky on what that is


Edit: Rules of r/financialindependence: 3. be civil 4. topics should drive discussion.

2021-09-21,"Not FIRE, but 24 Years Old and Quit My Job to Travel the World. Here's My Story and Reasoning","Not FIRE, but 24 Years Old and Quit My Job to Travel the World. Here's My Story and Reasoning What's up FIRE community. I wanted to share my personal ""FIRE"" story.

I'm a single 24 year old guy, and I got my first job working finance for a large company in March 2020. You know, when COVID-19 hit. I was in the office for a week, and then my company went remote. Remote work was chill. I talked to my friends all day on the phone, played some Xbox, and did whatever it is that 22 year olds do when they have too much free time. I also discovered the stock market.

Maybe some of you have heard of SPACs. Well I put $6k in a Roth IRA, and I turned that $6k into $300k+ in less than a year trading said SPACs. Was it awesome? I mean yeah, at first. What I didn't realize at the time was how much the stock market was controlling my life. All of my conversations gravitated towards investing. My subconscious mind was thinking about P&L at all times. I didn't sleep well, and I checked my portfolio every 15 minutes or so every day. Now I was one of the lucky ones: in hindsight I had all of the signs of a gambling problem, but I was good.

Then a month or so ago, I lost $130k. In a day. See when you play aggressive games, you are going to take aggressive burns. I should have cashed out at the top, but that's no fun, is it?

The problem was when I had $6k, I wanted $30k. Then $50k. Then $100k. Then $250k. Then $500k. If you've never been in the game, it seems stupid. But I kept winning, so the goal post kept moving. I never hit that $500k. In fact, I dropped well below $200k. Losing over $100k at 24 years old should have hurt, but honestly I was a bit relieved.

Why? Because it snapped me out of the game. I realized that whether or not I was making $$$, it didn't matter because I could never be present in my life. What a trash existence. That loss was the best thing that ever happened to me.

I sold everything and went all in on SPY. I still have a six figure Roth IRA at 24, which is better than most. I consider myself lucky.

""Wait Barmelo, I thought this was about travel?""

Yes, but I needed to provide a bit of context first.

So my company announced in July that we would be going back to the office in September. Well that didn't sound fun to me. I'm in a unique spot in that I will be beginning graduate school at Columbia University in Fall 2022. I still have a good bit of money both 1) saved up and 2) from stocks, and I realized that I would be selling my car before I moved to NYC next year too.

I bought a one way ticket to Barcelona, sold my 4runner, and told my company I was quitting.

Why?

Well we Americans spend way too much time working working working without a thought for anything else.

Graduate high school to get in a good college. After college get a good job. Then get married. Then have kids. Then work to put them through school. Then retire and spend the last years of your life chasing ambitions when you're too old to enjoy them. How sad.

Well the FIRE community wants to accelerate that retirement to let you enjoy those benefits sooner. The problem with that is that many people ignore their present to save for the future so much that they are miserable for years while trying to hit that target. Guess what? That mythical ""target"" won't make you happy.

I decided to take the first of what could be several ""mini"" retirements in life. I mean dude, I'm 24. I wanted to go see the Northern Lights in Iceland. Party in Prague. Ride a camel in Morocco. Walk where Jesus walked in Israel. Smoke some weed in Amsterdam. Fall in and out of love all over the world. Make a ton of mistakes, and even more memories.

And you know what? I'm a month in writing to you from Sevilla, Spain right now, and I have done some of those things. And it's freaking awesome.

We spend way too much time building financial capital at the expense of social capital, and that's a piss poor trade off.

It's okay to have fun. And spend some money. And enjoy yourself while you're young. 

I realize I'm speaking from a place of privilege. I'm going to a great grad school next year that will allow me to get a great job. I made a lot of money on the market which boosted my retirement account AND helped fund my trip. I had a car that sold for way more than it was worth.

But I know young people like me lurk this forum. Guys who will cut every cost to retire at 38. This is for you. When you're 60 you won't care if you retired at 38 or 40. You will care if you made memories worth remembering when you were young. If the choice is a journal full of incredible stories or a bank account full of dollars, go with the former.

2021-09-20,The Luxury of a High Savings Rate; or Who's Afraid of Bonds?,"The Luxury of a High Savings Rate; or Who's Afraid of Bonds? # Intro

A frequent question on this sub is whether bonds have any place in an accumulator's portfolio. Setting aside the currently *en vogue* idea of a bond tent (which is a weak asset allocation move of dubious value), many investors here take the view that can be crudely summarized as ""stocks have a higher expected return with higher volatility, the volatility is reduced by a long time horizon, I can stomach the volatility, therefore I should be 100% stocks."" Another poster has tackled [the specific fallacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/irzfer/the_fallacy_of_time_diversification_or_the_other/) of volatility being reduced over the long term, but I thought I'd give some attention to bonds to highlight ways they may still have utility for the accumulator.

# A Brief Note on Total Return

If you Google ""BND"" to find the return of the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF since inception, you'll see that the price has gone up a whopping 15% since inception in Spring 2007. Not 15% per year, but 15% overall. Google and Yahoo Finance, however, only report the market *price* of assets you search. Bonds and bond funds return the vast majority of their value as coupon payments. It's a simplification, but think of coupon payments as bond dividends. Google and Yahoo Finance do not include re-invested dividends, and should not be used for historical analysis of total return. If we look at [Portfolio Visualizer's](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=BND&allocation1_1=100) result for BND since inception, we see the more accurate 68% total return for that period. 

All values used for the rest of this post will be total returns in real, inflation-adjusted terms.

# The Luxury of a High Savings Rate

One simple reason putting bonds in your portfolio may be desirable is that it likely won't set your retirement back by a substantial amount, and in exchange you get a decent amount of safety with a reduction in portfolio volatility. [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&mode=1&timePeriod=4&startYear=1975&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=100%2F0+Portfolio&portfolioName2=80%2F20+Portfolio&portfolioName3=60%2F40+Portfolio&asset1=TotalStockMarket&allocation1_1=100&allocation1_2=80&allocation1_3=60&asset2=TreasuryNotes&allocation2_2=20&allocation2_3=40) shows us that the annualized growth rate of 100/0, 80/20, and 60/40 US Stock/10-yr Treasurys portfolios have been 8.59%, 7.88%, and 7%, respectively. Giving up 0.7% (or worse, 1.6%) seems like throwing money away.

But what does the FIRE saver lose (and what do they stand to gain) by choosing a more conservative portfolio? By using the [NPER family](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/pm6q8n/when_coastfi_is_rational_an_introduction_to_qalys/) of formulas, we can estimate this. 

Assume a FIRE-minded saver who knows that the value of money is in the quality of life that it provides and not as a score in a game that should be run as high as possible. As a result, they are interested in reaching a portfolio large enough to afford a comfortable retirement, and place more emphasis on hitting this number than on dying with the most money. They earn 80k/yr, save 40k/yr for a 50% savings rate, and are targeting a 3.33% withdrawal (or 30x the portfolio) and thus need 1.2M to retire.

* With the historical return of the 100/0 portfolio, they get there in 15.5 years.

* With the historical return of the 80/20 portfolio, they get there in 16 years, or **6 months later**.

* With the historical return of the 60/40 portfolio, they get there in 16.7 years, or **15 months later**. 

What do they get for that extra 0.5-1.25 years of work? In the fallout from the market crash of 2008:

* The 100/0 portfolio lost 37% in a single year and experienced a cumulative drop of 51% from Nov '07 to Feb '09. It didn't recover in value until Mar '12, **over 3 years later**.

* The 80/20 portfolio lost 26% in a single year and a cumulative 39% and took **a little under 2 years to recover**.

* The 60/40 portfolio lost 14% in a single year and a cumulative 26% and took **just over 1 year to recover**.

Considered another way, the 80/20 investor needs to save a relative 6% more (42k/yr) to retire at the same time as the 100/0 investor (53% savings rate) and the 60/40 investor needs to save a relative 14% more (45.5k/yr) to retire at the same time as the 100/0 investor (57% savings rate). (Assuming everyone still wants a 1.2M portfolio that allows for spending 40k/yr.)

In his incomparable post on the [Psychology of Money](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/), Morgan Housel highlights Charlie Munger's first rule of compounding: ""never interrupt it unnecessarily."" If there's a whiff of chance that an investor can be spooked out of the market by a 50% drop in their portfolio that doesn't recover for over 3 years, they'd likely be much better off saving 6% more or working an additional 6 months with a 80/20 portfolio than suffer the catastrophe that is quitting the market entirely. We all think we are made of sterner stuff than the ""average"" investor, but most people also think they're smarter than the average person too.

# But Bonds are Useless Now, Aren't They?

A concern that has been recirculating, *but is by no means new*, is that this time it's different and bonds have zero upside potential going forward. Phrased another way, ""interest rates can only go up,"" which *oBvIoUsLy* crushes their value. 

First, it's worth noting that besides any return characteristics, bonds have a place in risk-adjusting your portfolio. This role does not disappear even if bond return goes to 0% or even goes negative. Considered another way, stocks have a risk premium which is extra return in payment for the extra risk you take for holding them. There is no reason to believe that the risk premium for stocks has gone up for some reason, so if the risk-free rate (let's call it the rate on short term Treasurys) goes down from 2% to 0%, the expected return for stocks will go down by the same amount. There is no free lunch; everyone is getting smaller portions. 

Second, I can't hold a candle to nisiprius at the Bogleheads forum when it comes to illuminating the fallacies of ""common sense"" investing ideas like interest rate rises and bond pricing behavior. See his series of posts [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6058140#p6058140) and [here](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6065083#p6065083), demonstrating that the total value of a bond fund will eventually recover and provide a positive return even in a case where interest rates *never stop rising*. 

He follows this up with [a series of points](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6065103#p6065103) that are the best summary of bond dynamics that I've ever come across:

> * Rising interest rates exert a downward pressure on bond prices. The pressure is related to the *rate* of rise. If interest rates keep rising at, say, 1% per year, the pressure doesn't keep increasing, it is a constant pressure.
> * Bond prices respond to that pressure by moving downward.
> * Because a bond pays back its face value at maturity, its market value must rise to face value at maturity. A bond whose value is down must rise. You can think of this as an *upward* pull, often called the ""pull to maturity.""
> * The more depressed a bond price is, the more it has to rise in order to get back to face value.
> * That means that the more depressed the bond price is, the stronger the upward tug.
> * There is a balance of forces. Rising rates push down. The always-approaching maturity pulls up.
> * A forever-rising interest rate does **not** create a forever-falling declining bond price.
> * As the bond price declines, the pull to maturity becomes stronger and stronger, until an equilibrium is reached.
> * In other words, if the first 1% interest rate rise creates a -6.2% fall in the bond price, that does not mean the second, third, fourth etc. create further -6.2% falls.
> * The relationship, price fall = interest rate rise x duration is only true for a single instantaneous rise. It is **not cumulative** for long-term continouusly-rising interest rate, or a series of rises.
> * The bond *price* stabilizes, but coupon payments continue.

Finally, if you're intrigued by the mechanics of bonds (which on the whole are *much* more complicated instruments than stocks) and want to potentially get extra returns even in an ultra-low-rate environment, see this excellent tutorial on bond convexity over at [Portfolio Charts](https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/05/27/high-profits-at-low-rates-the-benefits-of-bond-convexity/). 

***

# Conclusions

Owning bonds can reduce portfolio volatility and provide an overall higher risk-adjusted return than 100% equity. Holding bonds may reduce expected return, but with a high savings rate there is minimal impact on additional working years. Bond funds are not facing a permanent zero-return outlook even if you believe interest rates have ""nowhere to go but up,"" and the subtle mechanics of bond convexity offer substantial asymmetrical upside if long duration bonds are appropriate for your investment horizon.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-09-19,What changes and what stays unchanged after hitting FI,"What changes and what stays unchanged after hitting FI I recently hit my FI number. Try to write down what I feel and what has changed.

Some background, I'm in the early 40s in VHCOL (SF/NY). Married w/ kids.

**I do not get irritated/offended easily.** I am much less competitive at work. I do not care about raise or pay equality. In the past, I always want to work harder and make more (or get promoted faster) than my peer. **THIS URGE COMPLETELY STOPS.** I also feel that I enjoy my work a bit as I know somehow every month could be my last work month.

**I try to shorten my work hours**. Well, I manage to negotiate a fully remote arrangement even after COVID. Yes, I have to travel to the office maybe once a month, but no more 2-3 hours commute. I am generally able to work \~32 hours a week (on average, and it can vary quite a bit).  My goal is to hit \~25 hours a week on average. Recently, at least three times a week I will check out my work at 2 or 3 PM and start to enjoy my day/evening.

Before COVID, it's not uncommon I have to spend \~55 hours a week (M-F) for work or commute (2 hours commute daily on average due to traffic).

**I'm thinking (all the time) when to pull the ""stop working trigger.""** While I hit my number (3.5\~4% SWR), I moved my target NW to hit 2\~2.5% SWR or 45 years old. Will I move the target NW one more time? Probably not.

**I eat healthier and exercise more.** The best luxury with more time to kill is that I can easily prioritize my day to ensure I exercise often. There's no more excuse to myself LOL.

**We inflate our expenses a bit.** Instead of saving 75% of my after-tax income, I now probably save 70%. The 5% was spent on things we want but don't really need. For example, iPhone 13 Pro Max instead of 13 and designer handbags from a store instead of from ROSS/Outlets. Because of the pandemic, our travel expense is very low.

**I sleep well.** Knowing that I don't need my job to continue my current lifestyle makes me happy and feel peaceful every night.

**We tip more.** I will leave 20 bucks for house cleaning when staying in a hotel, for example. I kind of feeling empathy for those who have to earn money by putting in lots of labor.

**Instead of selling on eBay, we often give things away freely.** For example, when I get a new iPhone, I will just give my iPhone to my relatives, say a cousin.  We also donate lots of clothes/books to charity when I don't need them.

**I have much more patience**. I walk slower, drive slower, and enjoy waiting for my coffee to be prepared in a Starbucks. I'm not in a rush. I brought a book w/ me (on my Phone or Kindle), and somehow could enjoy living the moment.

**I start paying attention to estate planning, tax, and investment.**  I start to read books, blogs, etc. Not an expert but try not to be surprised by IRS.

\--- What did not change ---

**We still feel that buying a new car is not necessary.** I'm happy with my 5-year car and feel no need/desire to get a new one.

**We still live in my first, small, house (if comparing to my peer).**  Well, I can and probably should get a new house given the mortgage is very low since I have paid off my mortgage. Not having a mortgage in a VHCOL gives me a peaceful feeling and I don't know how to put a price tag on this feeling. This is just a personal choice I guess.

**We still collect coupons (e.g. Subway sandwich), Starbucks stars, and credit card points.** I still use Credit cards based on the best reward multiplier (3x/4x, for example). Eventually, I will still use these credit card points to get miles and use miles to travel freely.

**My furniture pieces and most clothes are bought from Costco or liquidation/discount stores.** I still enjoy bargains and good deals. The quality looks good and I don't see a reason to spend thousands on clothes or furniture.",0.0,Neutral,English

2021-09-01,10 year Not-So-Humblebrag,"10 year Not-So-Humblebrag MAJOR edit:

Yes this post was somewhat about flaunting our accomplishments.  And it happened to be my 10 year anniversary of tracking so I made a slick chart and bragged to this community that has shifted my mindset so positively.  In terms of the “RE” side of the equation, I had another post about a month ago on my “crossroads”.

Long and short my spouse has some deep-seeded anxiety around money and some idealistic notions of “spending/having ‘more’ is virtuous” and that we need to keep building wealth and having flexibility to buy whatever we want at all costs.  Probably not so uncommon in our society but seems to be uncommon on this sub.

So despite having a lot to be proud of, FIRE is not always so simple.  We are at CoastFIRE now to retire in mid-40’s.  However my spouse is not on board.

Started tracking exactly 10 years ago a month following our wedding.  Married a woman who is somewhat neurotic about spending (thankfully, as I spent my first 8 years in the workforce spending nearly exactly what I made). 

 

41M spouse 39F, MCOL Heartland, Commercial Banking, spouse in corporate HR; 3 boys 6, 4, 2 all in daycare which has impacted our savings rate (ranges between $28-40k/year post-tax spend).   Hopefully she will be leaving her current role and bumping her income by $50-75k annually soon.  This is both because she is underpaid and can possibly leave for a more flexible or more mission-driven org as a promotion.

 

Definitions:

NW includes $386k in R/E Equity

Liquidity – cash plus retail brokerage; does not include $200k in unused HELOCs and $75k in unused brokerage lines of credit

Investable – cash, brokerage, retirement accounts and ~$250k in 529’s

 

Most proud of:

-3 healthy, good-hearted and respectful children

-successful marriage which has (and is requiring) work, including counseling

-doing some good work on my own mental health

-14x NW growth, 9x Investable growth

-purchased 2nd home in Ozarks in 2020 which rented most of this season and got us about a 15% cash on cash return

 

Goals:

-FIRE goal is between $2.5-$3.0MM investable (NOT including 529’s)

-I do enjoy my job and it is extremely flexible so I may just ride this out

-manage anger and fear; meditate more with yoga 1-2x per week

-need to focus on physical health in Q4 2021 and 2022, drop 20lbs and trim body fat % by a minimum of 10 percentage points

-My biggest goal is to find processes, not necessarily a goal (maybe this is the wrong approach, but process-focus has generally served me better than goal-focus, at least once the goal has been determined)

2021-09-01,One accountant's journey to FIRE: 825k at 29 (725k liquid),"One accountant's journey to FIRE: 825k at 29 (725k liquid) Long time no see r/FI, don’t worry you didn't miss a post. Thank you to the handful of people who checked up on me, it was very lovely of you. A year and a bit has passed but my net worth has doubled. Here’s what happened:

&#x200B;

* reached the 500k milestone in Nov 2020 ahead of schedule, but I knew the 	following developments were happening so I wasn’t going to bother posting multiple times in one year.  
 
* Got amicably downsized with 1 year severance in early 2021 (won’t give further info to reduce doxxing potential)  
 
* Sold our first house for a 300k profit in early 2021 (Toronto real estate	was going bananas). As usual you will only see my half of this in my 	net worth.  
 
* Made a mistake in real estate by buying a house we ended up hating. Ended up selling after less than half a year, after all the fees probably break even cash wise but there will be a gain on our tax return which we will attempt to fight but we’ll see.  
 
* Bought our hopefully forever home very recently.  
 

I’ve kept my previous post mainly intact but have made changes in ***bolded italics. All mentions of currency are in CAD.***

**About me**

Hi! I’m a ***29F*** CPA living in Toronto, Canada. I wanted to post this to show the non IT people in this sub that there are other careers where it’s possible to increase net worth quickly despite not making 100k right out of school. I’ve always been a saver but I discovered MMM in December 2015 (when I was 24). The realization I could retire at 35 really lit a fire under my ass to save even more and actually invest it. I was working through my CPA at a big 4 accounting firm at the time and hated every second of it. To be honest, accounting is boring and a ‘meh’ career at best, but the money is good so I will most likely stay on this path until I feel FI enough, if not actual FIRE.

I live in the most if not second most expensive city in Canada, sharing a ~~small~~ home with my  SO that we purchased ~~last~~ ***this*** year. I have no expensive hobbies other than travel and lead a pretty ‘boring’ life. I’m slowly getting healthier and into exercising but those things are harder for me than saving money.

The privilege – My parents paid for 3 out of my 4 years of university. That’s about 36k that I got for free which will never have to be repaid (I asked). That one year I paid for and for the 2 years I lived on campus I paid for myself through part time jobs before and during university. I also went back to live with my parents for one year rent free during my ***8*** years of working, which was a nice boost to my net worth during that time.

Here are the numbers!

**The goals**

My spending goal in retirement for one person is $20,000-$30,000 per year (as part of a $40,000-$60,000 spend household). I expect my SO to pay their own way on this FIRE journey. The dream at the moment looks like contract work (3-6 month contract) and traveling the rest of the time*,* most likely for 5ish years of travel. On the off years, we could work, volunteer, whatever. These FIRE plans are not that defined because who knows what I’ll feel like in 5-10 years.

All else being equal (is it ever?) I expect to achieve the following net worth milestones at the following ages:



&#x200B;

|**Annual Spend (individual)**|**$20,000.00**||**$25,000.00**||**$30,000.00**||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|FI @ 4%|$500,000|29|$625,000|30|$750,000|32|
|FI @ 3.5%|$571,429|30|***$714,285***|***31***|$857,142|33|
|FI @ 3.25%|$615,384|30|$769,230|32|$923,076|34|
|FI @ 3%|$666,666|31|$833,333|32|$1,000,000|34|

\^the above does not account for market corrections/recessions. If one happens tomorrow obviously those ages will change. ***The house sale and severance have really helped speed up my timelines here, but to be honest I’m not sure I’m ready to FIRE at this time, especially with a new mortgage. Currently about 2 years ahead of schedule though, which feels amazing (including only liquid assets).***

My flair is based on the first goal - $500k for 20k of spending at 4%. Is that going to be the number I FIRE at? ~~Probably~~ ***definitely*** not, given the expectation of a low growth environment in the near future and my young age at the expected time. But it’s a number that I would feel comfortable about enough to shift into something more chill. ~~It’s possible and even likely that I’ll experience the golden handcuffs phenom and stay for a while past that though to feather the nest and add security~~. ***Yes,*** ***I’ll probably work an additional 3-5 years (probably closer to 3) to establish a home and add some security to my nest egg. Probably looking at 1m in liquid assets? It’s overkill but might as well while I wait for my SO.***

Future plan/goals – I have no interest in having children, which enables my fast FIRE journey and long term travel plans. ~~Currently we live in a small bungalow in Scarbs with a basement unit that pays rent. Looking forward to selling in the next few years and buying a teardown to re-build, no enjoying living in an old house.~~ ***Currently living in a slightly newer 2 storey 4 bedroom detached house still in Scarborough but a bit further out.*** While Canada is great, it’s also possible that I will be OK with living somewhere else with single payer health care long term (I hate winter).

**Income history and Net Worth**

I started my career at a big 4 accounting firm making 45k, then 50k the next year, then 60k the next. These are standard salaries for this job in my city – Toronto. During this time I was renting a place downtown with a roommate or SO.

After leaving the firm my first job out was at 75k , and I moved to live with my parents for that year. Getting rid of rent was amazing for my net worth. Then I moved to a more interesting job that I thought I would love for 80k and started paying rent again. Then I got bored and moved to another job, where I made 95k the first year and now 100k with very generous 20-30% bonuses. ***There was a lay off at this company so now I work for a new company at 110k, with hopefully a reasonable bonus.*** First year we (my SO and i) lived downtown paying rent, now paying down a mortgage.  

I do have access to a side hustle that I started participating in around 2016. It’s very CPA specific and involves helping incoming CPAs get feedback for their practice exams in preparation for the qualification exams we have to write in this profession (PEP and CAP for those in the know). I think I made <$2000 the first year I did it, but it grew steadily and I made $***36,000*** last year from this. ***2021 will be less rich since COVID has hurt enrollment numbers (probably 20-25k).***

My net worth started at -$10,000 on the day I graduated university in the summer of 2013. That debt was owed to my parents for a lavish long trip I took that summer which I repaid in my first year of working. No regrets. After I started working and saving, it began steadily going up. My records are spotty in the beginning, since I was just saving to save.

I reached the 200k milestone sometime in April 2018 at 26 years old, 1 year and 5 months after 100k (4 years, 7 months after my first day of work). It definitely gets faster (especially if you have year of not paying rent!).

All else equal and barring a downturn, I hope to achieve the 300k milestone around winter 2019. Depending on the side hustle this year and with my increased income, here’s hoping for Dec 2018 instead of March 2019. Well that didn’t work out, but that was mainly because of saving up for the house during the low market in the 2018 winter and the closing costs.

Why the big jumps toward the end there? Bonuses and side hustle money coming through (it comes in large chunks) and the tenant providing first and last helped as well.

The 300k milestone was reached at the very end of April 2019, one year after 200k. It’s definitely getting easier and easier to amass more money as my income grows and the growth compounds due to the nest egg size.

I’m hoping 400k comes around the same time next year. Side hustle should be around the same this year but we’re planning a lavish vacation and some minor renovations.

More lines than usual because I wanted to show the COVID drops. It took my bonus and a side hustle payment to get me to crossing the 400k line, along with a minor market recovery.

The 400k milestone was reached at the very end of April 2020, one year after 300k. 500k is less than a year away should my plans for 2020 work out.

***The mortgage for the intermediary house was quite big since we chose to borrow more instead of putting the profits from the old house into the new house. While this was the mathematically correct thing to do, emotionally I felt quite house poor which reduced my enjoyment of the house. This is something I will consider in future real estate decisions that I wanted to highlight if anyone else is making a similar decision.  On the new house we put 20% down and this has made the mortgage payments much lighter. Misc is again high but for different reasons – I no longer have my phone paid for so I had to purchase one and get a phone plan. Moving costs are also included in here.***

***Our goal for the remainder of 2021 is to reduce food spending, we’ve been spending with reckless abandon on this category and need to rein it in.***

Please keep in mind that these expenses are for *myself only*. My SO and I split household expenses and spend our own money on items like clothes or video games. I don’t foresee our essentials spending increasing above what it currently is ~~and the tenant is very helpful in reducing those costs to a level where it is cheaper to live in the house than our previous condo rental without taking into account future selling prices, etc~~. We did consult a rent vs buy calculator before purchasing and the first house was still in the buy zone which is rare for Toronto. ~~I foresee us staying here for around 2-5 years before flipping into a newer home.~~ ***We ended up staying 2 years in the old house, mostly because it was a good time to sell. The second house was a less well thought out decision and as noted above, a mistake. The third house we definitely considered more carefully, hopefully we’ll stay here a long time to minimize transaction costs and money spent on real estate.***  

**Investments**

My tax advantaged accounts are maxed out and self-managed through a DIY brokerage. My taxable contributions are split evenly between the same self-managed DIY brokerage and a robo advisor for shits and giggles. The robo advisor is ~~winning~~ ***losing*** ***at the moment, because wealthsimple did something weird with their bonds and I lost 10k overnight .*** ~~I view my DIY brokerage holdings as a whole unit so my taxable account gets the brunt of the bonds (low rate environment).~~

The DIY Portfolio is as follows:

***Cash: 0.1% (preference is 0%), everything is in the market ***

***Bonds: 1.6% (preference is 5%), sold it all in March to buy more ETFs.***

***REITs: 1.4% (preference is 2.5%), VRE mostly. Also meh about this allocation.***  

***Canadian dividend stocks: 2.8% (preference is 2.5%, my investing strategy used to be dividend based so this is a remaining position from then), CDZ.***

***Canadian Market: 2.6% (preference is 2.5%),VCN***

***US Market – hedged to CAD: 23.8% (preference is 25.5%),VUS/VSP***

***US Market – unhedged: 28.5% (preference is 25.5%), VUN/VTI(n USD)***

***International (both developed and developing) – unhedged: 38.5% (preference is 36.5%) XEF+XEC/VXUS(in USD)***

My robo advisor has split my investments as follows:

Cash: 6%

Bonds: $9%

Low carbon global stocks: 30%

Canadian stocks: 24%

Global stocks: 16%

Cleantech stocks: 15%

***I finally called them to change my risk level from 8 to 9.***

***Since it was requested last post, here is m******y net worth is split as follows (rounded):***

   

|Cash|$18,000|
|:-|:-|
|TFSA (CAD equiv of Roth IRA)|$116,000|
|RRSP (CAD equiv of 401k)|$174,000|
|Taxable account – self directed|$206,000|
|Taxable account – robo advisor|$195,000|
|Other investments (community bonds)|$12,000|
|House Equity|$100,000|
|Car Equity (Should probably discount this?)|$5,000|
|Total|$827,000|
|Liquid Total|$727,000|

***The cash amount is only this high since I was holding cash for the downpayment. Once everything settles down and we buy furniture and stuff, cash will go down to near zero. All of my tax advantaged accounts are maxed out.***

&#x200B;

I’d love any advice on my allocations. I rebalance when I invest so it’s a bit slow.

Is there anything else you want to know?

2021-08-31,"Aug 2021 monthly overview. 2 years into my job, 23yo, intensive spreadsheeting, high SR, <100k income","Aug 2021 monthly overview. 2 years into my job, 23yo, intensive spreadsheeting, high SR, <100k income Some of you may know me as the girl that made an extensive [FIRE spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ejkuw8/i_made_an_advanced_budgetincomenet_worthfire/) for you all last year, and some of you may not know me at all. Those that do remember me know that I keep a very complex spreadsheet and go into very fine detail with all of my finances. Since I do a monthly overview of my spreadsheet for myself, I thought it might be fun to share that information to offer up new things you can implement into your own spreadsheets, as well as share my personal budgeting, investing, tracking, etc. I probably have a relatively average story as far as people in this server go, but with an increasingly younger crowd finding r/financialindependence and looking for people in their shoes, perhaps a post like this would be useful for those towards the beginning of their journey to see how it looks for someone a few years in. If this kind of post is valuable, I'd be happy to make them more often. This one will be pretty long since it includes background info as well as a look-back on 2020. I'd imagine any future post wouldn't require as much context.

**Spreadsheet**: My spreadsheet is (to me) the most interesting part of this post, so I'll put it at the top. It's my own creation, but takes influence and inspiration both in color scheme and content from various posters on this subreddit as well as the creator of [financialindependencesheet.com](https://financialindependencesheet.com). I'll get into the different specific components of my spreadsheet throughout this post, but at a glance, [my spreadsheet looks like this on the dashboard page](https://i.imgur.com/y3eoHU8.png). My [projection tab looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/ppqcbTl.png), my [withdrawal tab looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/fghqqGA.png) (and if you'd like to make your own, [I made a public one here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XaKBhRX55L3UgKg4GvY5gWC5FaPjvE6BMLneCmXEUZE/edit?usp=sharing); replace the light blue cells and the rest auto-populates. Click file > make a copy). [My budget looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/n1wR87g.png). I track my [income in this tab](https://i.imgur.com/HqXBgXm.png) (I put tax returns and stimulus checks in 'gifts,' for lack of better place to put them). This is how I track [bank account and credit card churning.](https://i.imgur.com/aLOpW45.png)

**Background**: I'm a 23-year old consultant in a MCOL metropolitan city in the US. Through the generosity of my parents and through merit-based scholarships, I graduated college debt-free in 2019 and joined a small consulting firm in August 2019 making $74,500. I run a small side business that trains folk to use different aspects of Microsoft Office. My tutoring business makes <$5000/yr. In 2020, I spent a total of $31,962 and saved 61.47% of my income, net of taxes. In 2021, I aim to spend $2300/mo. Since January 2020 (when I became eligible to enroll), I've been maxing out my 401k and HSA. I've contributed to my IRA since March of 2018. I churn credit cards to get more travel benefits. As you'll see in a moment, I love spreadsheets, data, and analytics. I meticulously track everything because I find it fun and interesting.

**Starting out with finances**: My family consists of first-generation immigrants. My dad started his own business which heavily invested in real estate. It survived the 2008 recession and luckily my parents are doing very well today. My parents lost a lot of money in the stock market, however, and never really spoke to me much about finances, besides recommending I stay away from stock and invest in 'real' assets like metals and land. I've always been relatively frugal and a saver, and I learned about personal finance and FIRE mostly through reddit, bogleheads forums, MMM, ERN, and madFIentist.

**2020 Income/Expenses**: Here is a sankey diagram of my income and spending in 2020 (made using sankeymatic). [https://i.imgur.com/wH3PklR.png](https://i.imgur.com/wH3PklR.png) My gross W2 income was made up of my $74,500 salary, a $1500 bonus, and my emplyer contribution to my 401k (100% up to 4%). The 1099 income was my tutoring business. Gifts include birthday and holiday presents. The reimbursements are from my work reimbursing my cell phone and internet bills. Credit card points were from [churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_churning.3F). I lived alone in a 1 bedroom apartment for $1600/mo for the better part of 2020. In August 2020, I leveraged the pandemic to lower my rent to $1500/mo, and my boyfriend (full-time student) moved in, who paid $500/mo of the rent. I covered all of our other expenses, leading my electric, gas, and food costs to go up somewhat. Gym was $11/mo and I cancelled it due to the pandemic. I adopted [my cat](https://i.imgur.com/mImpX7a.jpg) in August of 2020, she's about a 1.5yr old. Here are her lifetime expenses so far: [https://i.imgur.com/k2sVxrT.png](https://i.imgur.com/k2sVxrT.png). I paid a one-time fee to my apartment for having a cat ($250).

**2020 Investing**: Here's how my investing journey was looking in 2020: [https://i.imgur.com/gA6i1dm.png](https://i.imgur.com/gA6i1dm.png). February 2018 was when I first discovered I could put my money somewhere besides a checking account, and I promptly invested nearly my full checking account balance into my 2017 and 2018 Roth IRA. In October 2019, I discovered HYSAs paid more interest than the 0% of my checking account. In August 2019, I was hired full-time into the job I still work today.

**Investing picture now**: In my 401k, I invest 95% in FXAIX (S&P 500), and 5% into VBTIX (total bond market index fund). My IRA is 100% VTSAX (total stock market fund). My taxable account is 50% VTSAX and 50% VTIAX (international stock fund). My [contributions towards my investments](https://i.imgur.com/Nd2o3F2.png) have been significant due to a great income and relatively low expenses. Here is my financial picture today: [https://i.imgur.com/ez8PSsg.png](https://i.imgur.com/ez8PSsg.png), and [another view by % of my total NW](https://i.imgur.com/znJfEsb.png). I've been [hitting milestones quickly](https://i.imgur.com/e9BUxox.png) and am likely to cross $150k NW next month.

**FIRE, projections, metrics**: My FIRE goal is $2,000,000 in investments, a paid-off home, and enough to cover college for future children. The latter two are not relevant to my life right now, so my spreadsheets mainly focus on that $2M number. I decided on 2 million based on a desired withdrawal rate of 3.5% and expected expenses of $70k/yr, though this is obviously subject to change. My assumptions for future expenses (and how much my investments can already cover) are here: [https://i.imgur.com/O7i2rph.png](https://i.imgur.com/O7i2rph.png). I am [almost 7.5% of the way](https://i.imgur.com/QzBVgLA.png) to this goal. My ideal goal would be to hit this $2mm number by the age of 35, though on my current income (and without income from a partner), this would not be possible. I made a projection calculator (which I call my ""lab rat"") for myself to show how my income and contributions would have to increase to make this goal possible by 35 using [these assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/v7n94Rc.png). The blue line is what is expected to happen if I do not increase contributions beyond maxing 401k/HSA/IRA. So far, [I'm beating my lab rat](https://i.imgur.com/mIyyvGQ.png), but since my lab rat gets raises and bonuses (shown by the magenta trend shift change points), I'll need to get raises and bonuses too, in order to compete in the near future. At my current contribution rate, if the market goes up 7%/yr, [I'd be able to withdraw about $39.5k/yr at 3.5% at 35](https://i.imgur.com/g1URKMo.png). I have [already hit CoastFIRE at 65](https://i.imgur.com/SNdoTtd.png), which is an example of the power of starting early. I track [many metrics](https://i.imgur.com/5CPJI6U.png), but one of my favorites is [how much I've saved over how much I've earned/spen](https://i.imgur.com/yS0Viru.png)t (saved/spent in cyan, saved/earned in magenta).

**Budgeting**: I track my expenses every month, but on my dashboard I keep [a 6-month average](https://i.imgur.com/3eGbKVC.png). as a quick view. I follow a [YNAB-style of budgeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/wiki/index), in which my income (or in my case, my $2300 budget) is allocated towards all of my categories (every dollar has a ""job). Anything I earn that month in excess of my $2300 is invested.

I do not budget meticulously because I believe it is necessary for me or anyone else to do so. I like to budget, I like knowing exactly where my money goes. I like using it as a means to keep track of minimum spend for credit card churning sign up bonuses. I like knowing [which parts of my spending are necessary](https://i.imgur.com/JxfSQ7K.png) (cyan), and which parts can be cut if I lost my job (blue). I like knowing exactly how many months my emergency fund could cover, I like keeping track of fees that pop up only once a year, and I like optimizing. For all these reasons, I budget and track. You don't have to, but as a baseline I think it's useful to almost everyone to at least have an idea of how much they spend a year, so they know how much income (withdrawals) they'll need in retirement to maintain the same standard of living. comfortably.

**Budget Overview August 2021**: Here it is! [https://i.imgur.com/7Texxf1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7Texxf1.jpg). You'll see that the budgeted column tends to perfectly match activity. This is because at the start of the month I allocate a certain amount towards each line item, and as the month goes on I adjust my budgeted amounts as needed to cover and over- or under-spend. By the end of the month, extra is allocated towards travel, or wishes.

**Spending Breakdown August 2021**:

* We buy groceries at Aldi. Our low grocery expenses this month were supplemented by high eating out expenses.
* Eating out is especially high this month because I prepaid for an anniversary dinner for my boyfriend and I. That came out of the ""Anniversary Dinner' budget category at the bottom ($-390).
* In 'For the Car,' I filled up my tank once. I paid for valet parking for some friends that came to visit us, as well as paying for parking for myself when I met with a friend in the city last week.
* In 'For the Home,' I bought toilet paper and fixed a small plumbing issue.
* I buy litter and wet food for my cat each month.
* I buy 30-day subscriptions for $5 each month in 'Entertainment' for the videogame Genshin Impact.
* I bought some cleanser in 'Self-care'.
* Bought a present for my grandpa's birthday in 'Gifts for Others.'
* The 'Medical' expense was the remainder that my insurance didn't cover for a lab test.
* In 'Fees,' I had to pay a credit card annual fee as well as for a background check.
* ""Misc"" is negative due to a return earlier this month.
* ""In"" is anything that alters the amount of cash I paid for something. This includes things like when Venmo gave me $10 just for signing in, or a discount from Groupon, or using my credit card points to pay for a purchase. It allows me to track the value of whatever I got, versus the amount I actually paid out of pocket.
* I paid for a 4-day ""stay-cation"" this month at a hotel 30 minutes from us, and all meals and activities are rolled into 'Travel.' I'd been saving up for this vacation for several months, so the balance was already relatively high when we got into August.
* The apartment we live in is \~$1323/mo, and my boyfriend pays $500 of that.
* This was our highest electric bill. We use 2 window AC units and a portable AC to (try to) cool our 2-bedroom apartment, which we moved into in February 2021. I never again wish to live somewhere without central AC. This summer has been rough.
* I pay for a parking spot in our building's garage for $115/mo. It's covered and valet. The closest street parking is about 3 blocks away. This is a convenience expense for me, especially because I don't want to walk around by myself at night, or shovel my car out when it snows.
* The ""True Expenses"" category are things that I consider to be ""lumpy"" expenses, or ones that easily sneak up on me because they occur once per year.
* I prepaid for an anniversary dinner for myself and my boyfriend, and next month I'll start saving up for next year's anniversary dinner (saving $75/mo towards it).
* Other wishes: I have bras that fit, I'm just eyeing a specific one from a boutique store. Luxury type of purchase, don't worry about me lol. I need to replace my gaming headphones soon (they're not working anymore). I'm getting a haircut next month, I've been putting it off for too long. The place I go is kind of expensive but I have curly hair and they cut it well. The Tan Nubuck is a shoe that I thought was cute, and my boyfriend and I are planning to split the cost of a larger TV 50/50 once Black Friday comes around.

**Conclusion**: I'm pretty happy with my life. I have a loving family, boyfriend, and cat. I have a nice apartment, I like my job, and I taught myself to save and invest early on. I'm certainly incredibly privileged, and I'm proud of myself for putting the effort I did into not wasting that privilege. I studied hard in school and graduated with high distinction into a great job, where I work hard to stand out, be a valuable contributor, and learn everything I can. I teach others in my job about personal finance and investing, and I like making spreadsheets to post here and provide others with the resources to more accurately and efficiently plan for their futures. I'm aggressive with my savings because I just don't want for much, and despite enjoying my job I recognize that I can't/won't work forever, so while I'm young and compounding interest is on my side, I should do what I can to set myself up in the future. I want a family eventually, and might pursue an MBA. The future is wide open because I use the opportunities I have now to make the best choice for myself, which allows me the most choice and freedom in the future.

2021-08-31,"Milestone $1 million invested, net worth ~$1.8, family of 4, without $100k/year jobs. Done in 2.5 years!","Milestone $1 million invested, net worth ~$1.8, family of 4, without $100k/year jobs. Done in 2.5 years! EDIT:  Done \*\*Working\*\* in 2.5 years!

EDIT2: I am realizing that I did not make clear our income history. We have only gone over $100k combined in the past couple of years. Up until 2016, we were under $100k combined - between $83 and $97 for many years as we got the business going. 

# THE MILESTONE

My partner and I made it to the $1 million milestone invested.  See [pretty graph here](https://imgur.com/6Bs2wnh) \- I've gone back to 2009, I don't really have numbers or remember before this.  Net worth is just under $1.8 million if I add in home equity and kids' college accounts.  It feels good for sure, but I'm not jumping up and down.  I don't know if it's the pandemic or what, but I figured it was worth a post here with a breakdown of how we arrived to make me feel more accomplished and maybe help someone get inspired!

# THE FAMILY

My partner and I have been married since 2007, two kids (3rd grade and pre-school).  We have never made more than \~$165k combined, and some years were quite a bit less.  I graduated college in 2003 and started saving then.   We both work in a business we started together.

# THE PLAN

We are going to retire at the end of 2023.  I just set a date when my older kid was young and decided to make it happen.  No more one more year type of thing here.  One more year at my current age is much too valuable to give to working!

We are going for a coast type of retirement, where we will do odds and ends for cash when we feel like it. My partner will have a really hard time not creating something.  I don't have exact plans for how much we need to make, but the first year will be nothing just to decompress!  I will not consider it a failure if we need to work again before 65.  Now after that, I will want to be fully supported.  There are so many variables to consider, that I'm just going to take the leap and then adjust after.  I feel that I can easily make more money in many different ways as long as I am still relatively young.  I think a lot of people get paralyzed by the unknown and modeling every way this could go, but life is crazy and I feel far from guaranteed a long healthy life.

I'd like to say we can cut a lot of costs when we retire, but probably not that much.  We can drop down to one modern car (not counting our classics, a 15-window VW, an oval rear window Bug, and a 34 ford).  Maybe less on groceries/eating out?  We also have about $600k of equity in our home, bought in Sept 2010, so moving outside the city is an option.  If things got tough, we could certainly trim A LOT of fat from the budget, but I'm trying to be realistic about spending.

We are planning on putting our business up for sale at the beginning of 2023, and hopefully, have it sold/ transitioned by the end of 2023.  If I use 3-5x profits, we might get around $400-650k for it.  We are also building a second leg of the business which has the potential to make it a lot more valuable.  But we only have 2 years to do it!

Looking at our spending puts us at \~$2.2 mil for the famous 4% rule.  We will likely have \~$1.9, which means about $76k covered and $14k needing to come from somewhere.

# SPENDING/ BUDGET APPROACH

We took a middle-of-the-road approach:  we cut down on spending overall, yet still spent for all sorts of things.  We took some big trips (Egypt, Morocco, Hawaii, England/Wales, eastern Europe, Caribbean), lots of small trips to see friends (Nashville, Florida, Austin,   Montana,   SoCal, Chicago).  We get down to Mexico every year to just relax.   We had a big wedding - mainly because we are from different countries so it was a gathering of people from all over.  It was totally worth it, having all these people in our lives getting to spend one crazy weekend together.  Before kids we did a lot of concerts, we still go, just the ones that are really worth it.

Our [actual spending numbers for 2020](https://imgur.com/IT1I4OA) and [for 2019.](https://imgur.com/LDyXUEQ)  At this point, I don't enter numbers every month or really check our spending too much.  It's more or less on autopilot.

Things we did cut deeply on:

* our house.  the bank would have let us spend much, much more.  We got a lower-end fixer-upper house.  Did most of the renovations ourselves and got it just how we want it.
* our daily drivers: picked a budget and stuck to it for each of our daily drivers.  We went for stuff that was big enough to fit kids and gear, had mechanics check them out, bought from private parties to save even more.
* clothes:  kids get second-hand clothes, toys, and books.  Even a lot of baby gear that we weren't gifted we got second-hand.  We only buy ourselves new clothes when we really need them.
* furniture:  we bought a couple of things, but a lot is from family.  For both kids' rooms we didn't buy a single piece of furniture.  We've upgraded a few pieces (dining table) since we've been in this house a while.
* electronics:  one TV is plenty, had it for about 8 years now and still looks great.  Phones we never buy through the carrier, since they always get you on the fees.  We are both tough on our phones, so we get durable ones that are fast.  I don't care about much else.  We have an $80/ month plan for unlimited everything for 2.
* daycare:  we made our schedules work, plus help from family one day/week so that we didn't need daycare.  Our older one did some before/after-school programs to help fill in, but those were very affordable.

# HOBBIES

Hobbies are hiking, camping, the gym and group sports, learning languages, and the aforementioned car collection (not a cheap hobby!).  Hobbies for after retirement are relearning guitar, cycling, and golf.  Those just need too much time for us to dedicate right now.  Also reading more books!  We also want to spend more time with the kids, coach their activities, volunteer at school, and do things like that that I don't have time or mental capacity to handle.

# INVESTMENTS

Mostly a set it and forget it type of thing.  [You can see my returns here](https://imgur.com/jWqL6Wh) \- again I didn't have much data before 2009, so the returns from investments may be off a bit, but can't be too bad.  I am in 27% bonds right now, been upping that now that we are approaching the date. My plan is to get up to 35-40% bonds at retirement and use an ERN-style glide path in retirement.

I say mostly hands-off, but I got sucked into Robinhood last July (I actually ditched Robinhood and moved to Tastytrade this year) and have been trading options for the past year.  I put in $20k as play money and have done pretty well.   Obviously, I could afford to lose it, but I'm not doing WSB YOLO stuff.

2021-08-25,Thoughts Nearing the Finish Line,"Thoughts Nearing the Finish Line I've been lurking here for the last 7ish years and wanted to share my thoughts on what the boring middle and final stretch looked like. Figures are rounded to the nearest $100K.

Me:

* 37 years old
* Married
* Current salary $139K
* One toddler, twins on the way
* Partner FIREd in 2014
* Current NW of $2.1M, liquid investments of $1.8M
* Fully vested defined benefit retirement plan
* Finance and accounting jobs, no FAANG

TLDR: FIRE without tech salaries, crypto, or real estate. Very fortunate to have never been significantly in debt and to have a like minded partner. Thanks to the sub as a whole for all the years of posts and collective wisdom!

I had a nominal amount of debt coming out of school (\~$40K @ 6%). Was fortunate to get a job with one of the Big 4 accounting firms right out of school. I purchased an inexpensive townhome with some assistance from my parents for the downpayment, but could not have timed it worse. Had multiple friends roll through as roommates, but was inconsistent in charging them rent. The townhouse ended up being underwater for a number of years but was ultimately sold for a modest gain (\~$60K before transaction costs) that was rolled into the downpayment on our current home. 

Met my partner at the Big 4 firm and our long-term desire to free ourselves of accounting shackles led us to FP&A jobs with a Fortune 100 company after about 4 years. Our finances were kept separate up until we married, but we were probably right around $0 NW at that time. My only regret from that time is not investing more in tax-deferred accounts but my expense spending was pretty lax. We always contributed enough to get the 401(k) match, but it would have been an optimal time for Roth contributions. Lesson learned.

Our Fortune 100 careers are without a doubt the biggest catalyst in achieving our FIRE goals. During that time we had gotten married and put together a framework to FIRE. We never had expensive hobbies or tastes aside from travel. Even then we continued to travel like poor college kids despite having annual gross income in excess of $200K. MMM was the big catalyst for me getting onboard, my partner had always been frugal and just needed the push to invest the cash horde they had accumulated. Our savings rate varied between 60-70% during those years and we easily surpassed our original FIRE targets. I maxed out retirement contributions, but for my partner, we intentionally only contributed enough to get the 401(k) match and then dumped the rest of their salary into a taxable brokerage account. You grow up, and priorities change. We were both ready to leave the corporate drudgery (endless reorgs, frustrating bosses, 60+ hour weeks) in favor of a better work-life balance.

After lots of discussions and introspection, my partner left to pursue life without the necessity to work. Simultaneously I applied for jobs that would allow me to downshift in both hours and salary in exchange for having access to a defined benefit retirement plan. A not completely unexpected bonus with my new employer was also being able to participate in their 457(b) plan. During the last 7ish years my partner started a successful part-time small business that netted around $30K annually. Since we didn't need any of that, it all ended up in a solo 401(k) plan.

Like I mentioned earlier, we sold the townhouse in anticipation of a larger home for raising a family. We had some trepidation about buying at what we thought was the peak of the housing market (2017) but feel very fortunate to not have waited until our first child was born in 2019. We've diligently tracked expenses over the last 9 years and can comfortably FIRE now if we wanted. The biggest twist is the addition of the twins at the beginning of 2022. Assuming they're healthy and don't have a significant risk of long-term healthcare needs, I'll take 12 weeks of parental leave and then put in my notice. Having both my partner and me home without any work stress or obligations is an incredible luxury that we will never take for granted. We can envision a future state where we start up another part-time business or return to office work (part-time of course) once all three kids are back in school, but we've got a lot of diapers and sleepless nights to get through before we're at that point.

I've never been a big fan of NW as a valuable metric for us since we're planning on staying in our primary residence and have no real estate holdings. We've stuck to a portfolio that's around 95% equity (VTSAX, VFIAX, limited individual equities), 4% bonds (Treasuries), and 1% cash. Here's how the portfolio stacked up since 2013:

* 2013 - $0.2 million
* 2014 - $0.3 million
* 2015 - $0.7 million
* 2016 - $0.7 million
* 2017 - $0.9 million
* 2018 - $0.9 million
* 2019 - $1.1 million
* 2020 - $1.5 million
* 2021 - $1.8 million

Our boring middle ended up begin relatively short because of the bull market that we've lucked into. I remember looking at the portfolio regularly, obsessing over $10K increases or decreases during those days, and feeling like we'd never hit our goals. The best advice I have there is to live the life you want and let time in the market do its thing. We both focused heavily on our careers during our 20s and saw our salaries increase threefold rather quickly. I'm obviously biased by my experience, but we increased our earning potential much quicker by focusing on our jobs and skillsets as opposed to pursuing side hustles. A partner who has the same (or greater) earning potential and perspective cannot possibly be understated either. There's no way I'd be hitting this timeline if we weren't aligned.

I also want to express a ton of gratitude to everyone in this community. I get tons of enjoyment every day. You're all the engine that keeps this machine moving forward and I wanted to finally take a moment to acknowledge that!

I've got plenty more details that I'm happy to share but figured the post is long enough already. Happy to answer any questions that you've got!",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-08-24,Just hit the 1M mark!,"Just hit the 1M mark! 28 M, wife and two kids, one more on the way. Just wanted to share this success since my wife doesn’t care too much and can’t tell anyone else. I have been hovering close to the 1M mark for the last couple months but finally feel pretty good that I’ve firmly taken that milestone. 

————————— Intemission
Edit: I feel like I need to add more FIRE details because I mostly talk about the last year below. I didn’t get to 500k at 26 in 2020 without living well below my means for all those years. Until 2020 I was about 80% Vanguard S&P500 index fund and 20% company stock. 2011 18k/yr, 2012 promo 24k/yr, 2013 new job, promo part way through 32k/yr, 2014 promo 45k/yr, 2015 stock vest coming in 70k/yr, 2016 promo 105k/yr, 2017 stock vest bumping to 140k/yr, 2018 promo 200k/yr, 2019 great stock vest 210k, 2020 promo 250k/yr. 2015,16 and 17 my wife also worked and brought in 55k, 65k and 85k. 

Getting to 500k was steady between 2013 and 2020, I actually got up to about 600k before the S&P500 tanked. The biggest thing for us is that our expenses haven’t climbed much over the last 8 years, we were in a HCOL in the Silicon Valley until but no kid until 2017, moved to a MCOL area in 2018 and the wife stopped working. 

Some of the things that have really helped keep expenses down even with kids: my wife always shops deals, so if chicken is on sale we are buying and freezing, most of my clothes are old navy discount racks, we keep monthly subscriptions low (just Prime and Netflix, no cable or anything), I’m big on DIY and would say very handy, I do most all the work at the rental and at my house, my wife is very active in our neighborhood free and classified pages, all my kids shoes are lightly used on the cheap and so many toys that were cheap or free and then we put the toys they are bored of on there too, and we rarely eat out, max once a week. 

—————————— back to the original post
Some backstory, been a lurker and commenter for at least a few years. Been unofficially practicing many of the FIRE principles for most my life. Wife and I are both frugal. We both worked until our first kid was born four years ago, now it’s just me. 

Yearly income is about 250k/yr. Operations management in a company you buy stuff from probably weekly.  Asset breakdown is 45k cash, 675k in investments, 318k liquid, the rest in retirement accounts. 126k in equity in a duplex, payment is 1.5k/month, pulls in 3k/month. 222k is equity in the house I live in. 1.068M total right now. 

2020 and 2021 have been really good to me. I had a couple of windfalls that helped me move from ~500k to 1M. I am very risk averse and took a couple bets I thought had very low down side. I was pretty heavy in my companies stock which didn’t feel the affects of COVID. In March I sold basically every investment I had (except 401k, ~200k) and put all that money into travel stocks (airlines, cruise lines, and hotels). I sold all of these shortly after the 1 year mark in March 2021 and made ~130% return on average with PK and RCL being the biggest at 190% and 200% and the lowest being DAL at 80%. Next my rental property and home have both increased in value by at least 20%. I have fairly low end values for those and could possibly get over 100k above where I have them. I am very close to selling the duplex to take that quick gain. 

The second thing that has caused some volatility for me is that I am an ape and hold 1k shares of GME, it’s small enough that I feel comfortable being firmly above the 1M mark but it has caused some wild swings. The plus here is that my initial purchase was 310 shares at $44 which is currently a 374% gain, but I have averaged up to 130 over the last 7 or 8 months. 

Not the standard FIRE individual but took some risks to try and speed things up which has so far worked. I’ll include a link to a Mint graph of my net worth. Please imagine that the line is smooth. Mint can be weird, for awhile I had my house without the loan, so there was a period in like 2019 where it shows a huge spike in net worth and then it drops when I was able to link my loan.

2021-08-17,Sharing My FIRE Journey So Far (25M / USA ---> Hong Kong / Teacher / > 100K NW),"Sharing My FIRE Journey So Far (25M / USA ---> Hong Kong / Teacher / > 100K NW) Greetings Everybody! Firstly, just want to thank all of you who have contributed to this sub as I was mainly introduced to the concept of FIRE from here! I'm posting to share my FIRE journey so far and to hear your comments/advice as well as to connect with others who are interested in FIRE especially if they're currently living in Hong Kong (feeling a bit lonely lately hahaha). This will be quite a long post, so feel free to read the sections you are interested in :)

# Personal & Family Background (NYC / Ages: 0-22 / 1996-2018 / Personal NW: $0):

I was born and raised in NYC and went through all of my education there. My parents were immigrants and my family was solid middle class with my dad (sole income earner) making \~100K at the peak of his career prior to 2008 before he got laid off. I have an undergraduate degree in finance from a local university in NYC (tuition was $0 as I was part of a program that covered all tuition costs. After completing a few internships related to finance and nearing graduation, I realized the work I did during my internships was meaningless (mostly excel and spreadsheet related work related to financial analyses) and bullshit and I remember I had a day during my final internship where I thought, ""Holy fucking shit, how are you gonna do this shit for 40 years?"" Everything just felt disgustingly fake (the forced networking, coffee chats, work hard play hard attitude, company cares about you) and bullshit during these internships. During the final term of college, I decided I needed to get out of the USA due to a couple of reasons and I would try to teach English to children in a place where I studied abroad during college: Hong Kong! This is where my FIRE journey would begin!

# FIRE TRACKING Details (HK / Ages 22-Present / Late 2018-Present / all figures in USD):

First 4 Months (Sep 2018-Dec 2018) - \[FT Job: playgroup English teacher @ $36K annual salary\] **End of 2018 Net Worth:** **\~8,900**

2019-2020: - \[FT Job #1: playgroup English teacher @ $36K annual salary with $1.5K bonus at end of year, Side Hustles: @ 12K == **TOTAL 2019 INCOME @ $49.5K**\] **Investing Returns: @ $3K Yearly** **Expenses: $24.5K**

**End of 2019 Net Worth:** **\~$37,000**

**Current 2021 Net Worth: \~$116,000**

# Current Assets Breakdown:

* Savings Accounts: $28K (I know this is quite high, but I have $10-15K planned additional expenses that I will touch on in the expenses section later on)
* Vanguard Long Term ETFs: $43K from $27K deposited. My four current ETFs here are VTI, VOO, MGK, and VGT with about an even split between the four of them. I know I should have more contributed here, but I've been waiting for a \~10% pullback in indexes and I know that most of you would view me as foolish for trying to time the market hahaha.
* MPF Account (Hong Kong equivalent of a mandatory IRA/401K type of account? where 5% is deducted from monthly salary and employer contributes a matching 5% monthly): $15.7K from $11.5K contributed in total so far by me and employers.
* Long Term Stocks, ARK ETFs, and Small Options Trading Account: $18K from $21K deposited. Most of you might cringe at this section of assets, but I do believe in innovation and technology companies the most and own some speculative growth stocks, ARK ETFs, and do some options trading as a hobby on a $3,000 account.
* Crypto: 9.5K from 5K deposited.
* Cash: Have about $1,000 on hand.

\*\* I know about IRAs, HSAs, 401Ks, and Roth IRAs, but since I am working abroad and under the FEIE limit for US taxes, I haven't had any US taxable income ever since moving and working abroad. From my understanding, this makes me ineligible to contribute to the aforementioned accounts, but please correct me if I'm wrong and if there is a way to contribute in my situation!\*\*

# Monthly Expenses Breakdown:

So I **make about $5,100** total per month from my full time job and side hustles. I usually **spend around $1600-$2000 monthly**. Here is a rough estimate of how I spend my money below expressed in raw value and % of income:

* Rent & Utilities: $800 (\~16%)
* Food and Groceries: $630 (\~12%) - I know I probably spend too much on food, but I eat out usually 2 meals a day lol. Tried cooking 2-3 times a week before but the money saved and extra time used wasn't significant enough for me to keep wanting to do it. Cooking is something I want to spend a lot of time on when I reach FF though!
* Public Transportation: $100 (\~2%)
* Phone Bill: $15 (\~<1%)
* Entertainment and Miscellaneous Expenses: $250 (\~5%)

I usually don't spend too much on anything besides necessities because my income isn't super high compared to many of you who work in tech, finance, medicine, sales that rake in 6 figures easily, so I try to maximize saving the most I can each month.

I do have two major expenses coming up which is a $10,000 tuition bill for a post graduate teaching program (I can double my current 40K salary to around 85K starting from September 2022 after obtaining this credential and if things go according to plan). I also have two missing teeth from two failed root canals and one implant in Hong Kong costs around 2.5-3K ...... and I've put this off for a long time already since my original plan was to have it done in China or another SEA country, but COVID has ruined that plan...... This is why I have more than I should in my savings accounts instead of invested.

# Final Thoughts / Target FIRE Amount / Future Goals:

Honestly learning and putting this movement into practice has given me a solid goal and hope in life. I'm quite a cynical person and I don't think I've ever seen a smiling person going to work on the morning subways/trains during my personal 10 years of commuting to school/work. I honestly can't imagine being a working slave for 40-50 years and am so thankful for FIRE for showing me a way out. At the moment, I do love working with my students and kids in general (they are much more genuine and easier to work with than adults and seeing them grow and do funny things makes me kinda happy), but I still hate the fact that I must wake up before 7AM on a workday and have to work 5 days to get 2 days of ""rest"" and the bureaucracy of schools and incompetency of those who run the schools and education system. I do 100% prefer what I'm doing at the moment now compared to what I did in the finance world mindlessly churning spreadsheets like some robot and hearing corporate bullshit everyday. My #1 goal at the moment is achieving FIRE, but I do really want to see as much of the world as I can before I die, so that's what I'll do the most of if I achieve FIRE one day. Other than that, I'm quite a simple person and can get enjoyment from just chilling and playing video games, reading, watching interesting movies and shows, playing some sports / team sports, and hanging out with friends.

I am probably going to remain legally ""single"" for the rest of my life (I am currently in a happy relationship, but marriage just seems too risky to me since a person can change whenever and can involve losing A LOT of money if the divorce is messy lol) and not have any biological kids since I spend so much time around kids already! If I do want a child post FIRE, I'll look towards adoption instead of creating more waste for this dying planet.

I think I would want to work full time for an employer for another 10 years MAX at this point and am looking to having **$1.5-2 million** saved up before I ride off into the sunset, so that's my current target amount for now, but we'll see how things go.

Anyways, thank you to all of you who read this post and if you are in Hong Kong or anywhere really and want to meet up or make a new friend, feel free to comment or send me a DM and we can chat (I am lacking friends in HK who share similar interests and most of my close friends are all still in the US). Any advice or tips would also be appreciated as well especially if there is something you wish you had known earlier in your FIRE journey! Thanks :)",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-08-16,Late 20s FIRE with slow travel,"Late 20s FIRE with slow travel My wife and I (both late 20s) are looking to sell everything and travel for a year with our daughter (currently 2) starting August 2023. This plan is contingent on a consistent reopening of travel. I am coming to FI since there aren’t many subreddits with great information about “slow travel” (the subreddit is pretty dead) and the last relevant thread was 9+ months ago. 

I am currently a Dentist, practicing in the states, and my wife stays home with our daughter. Our NW is around 1.7M. 1.35M in taxable brokerage accounts, 100k in cryptocurrencies, 100k in home equity, 40k in cash, 30k in retirement accounts, 30k in paid off cars, and 20k in bonds. Most of our NW is derived from luck. Currently have 1.5 more contractually obligated years to work, and then we are free and clear. Only debt is attached to our house. I have a revolving collateralized LOC of 200k with a $100 balance to keep it active. 

We are feeling pretty burned out going through undergrad, dental school, and these last few years working, and feel like we want to take a hard pause to spend time as a family. I have lived abroad in the past and we have travelled together. I understand some of the difficulties of long term travel. However, I have never travelled extensively with a child. Our daughter will be nearly 4 when we plan to leave the states and head to Europe.

Our current projected spend is roughly 5k per month. This is consistent with a 3.5% withdrawal rate, and I think it is a pretty generous budget.

Lodging: $2,000.00

Food: $1,200.00

Health Insurance: $100.00

International Travel: $300.00

Local Travel: $550.00

Activities: $250.00

Self care: $200.00

Phone/ Data: $60.00

media: $50.00

Visas: $20.00

Gifts: $80.00

Storage facility: $120.00

Total: $4,930.00

Our current itinerary is to stay roughly 1 month in each city starting in Edinburgh -> Prague -> Budapest -> Slovenia -> Croatia -> Istanbul -> Jerusalem -> Florence -> French countryside -> Spain, and fly home from Barcelona or leave the Schengen zone and continue our travels. Our itinerary is very flexible at this point, and is centered around European Shengen zone rules. We love the idea of going to Istanbul, but worry that going from central Europe to Istanbul to Israel, back to Europe could be a lot of travel. Would it make more sense to keep the trip a bit more centralized? 

We plan on renting a car for several weeks in each of the locations to explore some of the smaller/ less travelled sites. Any advice on specific destinations that we should include? I feel pretty confident that we aren’t just larping/ grasping at straws. In my head, our plan seems pretty solid, but I can’t shake the feeling that I am overlooking something. We plan to purchase our flights 6-8 months in advance using CC points, and pre-purchase our first month’s airbnb/ car rental. We also anticipate around $2500 on hiring a moving company to put our stuff in storage. 

All advice, encouragement, or personal anecdotes are welcome.",0.0,Neutral,English

My favorite FIRE posts in the subreddit are those which include raw details and data, i’ll try and deliver.

Recap: 33 year old couple in the SF Bay area both working at “FAANG” companies in non-engineering roles (ie **Senior Data Science Manage**r for me). My partner and I both earn fairly “Fat” bay area salaries but have more modest spending goals of 75-100k excluding housing when FIRE.  My plan was to be able to retire by 35.  I am really aiming for .5-2 more years before either fully FIRE or partially FIRE (with relocation).  Starting to do analysis into different potential cities.  On paper many cities within North Carolina hit the right balance of taxes, weather, politics, schooling (I have a toddler).

Reflections from the past year:  In my very first update /u/BlackCardRogue commented “You won’t quit.  The money is too good. You want to lean FIRE when you can fat FIRE working another 7 years? Really?”.  Here we are… he might be fucking right and I am just lying to myself saying “just 1 more year”.  I think the uncertainty around the pandemic and the increases in housing within my target FIRE locations make this fairly reasonable.  The other unexpected bonus coming out of the pandemic is flexibility to work remote for essentially my same salary (more even when factoring in taxes).

**FIRE Goals:**  Raised the bar this year on target spend.  Also keeping an eye on amount needed for housing.

* Targeting $100k annual spend (excluding housing).  Conservatively using 33x spend (essentially 3% withdraw rate).  See current spending further below.  Lots of discretionary spending, SF housing costs, childcare that an flex as needed.
* \~500k Available for a house purchase in MCOL city.  Narrowing in on MCOL cities meeting different tax treatment, public school, weather requirements.  Raleigh, NC region on paper is hitting a lot of this to give you an idea.
* 4 Years College for my toddler (assuming state-school, 23k per year in today’s dollars).

**Overall Investment Value as of 8/4**:  $3.5M, +52% YoY  (prev. 2.3M)

* 470k from new contributions (I reduced cash savings to increase investments over the past year).  Split of contributions was:  8% Aftertax/Roth, 10% Pre-Tax, 82% taxable
* 730k from gains + dividends
* Current Asset Allocation: 60/30/10 (Domestic/International/Bond) 100% in low cost index funds, zero crypto, zero individual stocks, boring Bogle approach.
* Account Split: 57% Taxable (normal broker), 30% Pre-Tax (traditional 401k), 13% Post-Tax (roth) 
* This is the majority of my networth. I have an additional 300k split across some vested company stock, emergency fund, future house downpayment (likely would just use a PAL) that I view separate from FIRE funds.

I include my full **base** salary history later below (excludes equity and my wife's earnings). Last updates had people wanting to know the equity side.  Here is the breakdown for what I expect in 2021:

* Base Salary: $245k
* Bonus: $60k
* Stock Vests: $370k “The golden handcuffs”

The equity refreshers clearly add up over the last 7 years.  This is where the real upside in the tech world lives.  

**High Level Advice**

1. Just accept that you have been dealt a good fucking hand in this game called life if you are even in the position to think this is possible.
2. You can’t plan life. If never works how you expect. I could never have planned my career in the way it ended up. Be opportunistic with new opportunities that you didn’t expect arise… but don’t burn too many bridges to get there. (Especially if you work in some of the more incestuous industries like tech).
3. Acknowledge that I am not just one person. Going through the majority of my adult life with a like minded partner has had a huge multiplier. Economies of scale are powerful. Even just needing a 1 bedroom in a HCOL city while you are DINKs can allow for heavy savings in key early years. Trust me I tried finding another couple with a kid to further take advantage of this but it kept attracting a weird swinger vibe.
4. Don’t overthink it. The basics of FIRE are not complicated. Just save as much as you can. As you progress don’t let life inflate too much and keep your savings rates high. Don’t kill yourself here. Live the life you want now. That might be the same one in FIRE (minus the job) or it could be completely different. But it is your life and you only get one of them.

**Personal Base Salary History** (Later on equity contributes a large portion of my salary but isn’t included here, note: don’t get overly hung up on the exact ages/dates everything is within +/- 1 year but smoothed out to make doxxing a little harder).  [My first update includes the full College -> Career Progression](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/91j113/15m_invested_25m_goal_30m_30f_w_1_child_liberal/).  I encourage you to check it out if you want to see the details of how I ended up working at a FAANG as a Data Science Manager.

My career 

* 2008 New Grad: $37k
* 2009: $44.5k (+20% new job)
* 2009: $48.5k (+9%, performance based raise)
* 2010: $48.5k (No raise this year, switch jobs at the same salary but more room to grow)
* 2011: $60k (+23.7% Performance based raise, it had been >500 days since my last raise)
* 2012: $66k (+10% annual performance raise)
* 2013: $80k (+21.21% Was a raise to get me closer to market salary and an effort for my employer to retain me, went along with a fancy inflated title)
* 2014: $138k (+72.5%, recruited to the bay area as a “data scientist”)
* 2015: $142k (+3%, percentage wise the smallest raise I ever received. Clearly an inflation based raise)
* 2015: $158k (+11%, Promoted during the year)
* 2016: $170k (+7%) Performance
* 2017: $190k (+12%, Performance)
* 2018: $210k (10%, Promotion)
* 2019: $225k (7%) Performance
* 2020: $240k  (+6.6%) Performance
* 2021: $245k (2%) Clearly hit the top of the band for my level.  It has been 1,270 days since my last promotion… but who is keeping track.

2021-08-04,Hit CoastFIRE this week! More motivated than ever and what has helped me,"Hit CoastFIRE this week! More motivated than ever and what has helped me Coming here to celebrate a bit as I don't have people to share this with IRL. TL;DR at the bottom. 

But wow feels freeing! Last night I realized that if I let my investments grow across taxable, 401k, and Roth IRA that we'd hit our number by age 60 in average markets. 

Have to say the pressure feels off now. We'll be okay. We'll hit bumps I'm sure but we have enough to weather the storm. Now it's all about staying the course and speeding up that time horizon. 

And while the weight on my shoulders feels less, *the motivation is stronger than ever*. 

We're married, 31 years old, 1 kid so far. I'm +90% of our income so feel daily pressure (that I put on myself) to keep the pedal down and keep the family in a secure spot. 

I've been incredibly fortunate to get some lucky timing in my career that's accelerated earnings last three years or so. No startup stock excitement or FAANG, just moved into sales and uncapped commissions are really good when they're good with the right company. Have grossed over $300k last two years which is the bulk of the accelerated savings. 

Investments just crossed $600k and the goal is Chubby FIRE with a target investment portfolio in the $3.5m range. Possibly higher if I'm still motivated to make bigger career moves in 5-10 years. 

**Backstory that you probably don't care about but I always like to read others so...**

Started my career out of college with minimum wage grunt desk work. Moved up with some raises and promotions in the $50k-70k range and thought I was doing really well. 

Learned about budgeting and YNAB through that time when I realized my bank account wasn't growing on $7.50 an hour and living downtown.

Got hints of ""FIRE"" type ideas but was more excited by compound interest and getting rid of debt. 

Built some good financial habits in that time by sticking to budgets, attacking debt, and investing what I could, but realized to get ahead I'd need to earn more in order to save more. 

Doubled down on personal development and career growth and was lucky to have mentors along the way who helped me level up. 

**Goals now are**:

* Don't fuck it up
* Build more stability in our careers through this high-earning phase. I always assume I could get fired tomorrow. 
* Don't lose sight of family
* Avoid significant lifestyle creep and spending (a bigger house was our big shift through income increase but otherwise we're fairly frugal. Don't daily/monthly budget anymore though)
* See what we can do about income taxes if anything
* Stop holding onto so much cash... I've got 20% of liquid net worth in cash right now and it's much more than we need. It's my comfort blanket. 

**TL;DR and Unsolicited Advice** (I used to get really jealous at people earning what I am now so I get it if you've bounced and downvoted. Keep at it.)

* Investments crossed over $600k this week and would get us to retirement goal by age 60. The realistic goal for true ""FIRE' is 6-12 in our late 30s or early 40s depending on markets and earnings. 
* Keep using the r/personalfinance flow chart. It's a great way to remind yourself of what's next as your career advances or you're crossing off goals. 
* Ask for help and give help often. 
* People roll their eyes but your net worth is your network. It's very hard to improve yourself if you're not around people better than yourself. 
* Personal development isn't woo-woo. Books that have helped me are often marketing or business-related. Helps me speak to a higher level with colleagues, build rapport, and translate business wins into a career. Like ""80/20 Sales and Marketing"" - all about Google Ads but learning about the Pareto Principle from that book has literally changed my life. Then layer that mindset in with Gallup Strengthsfinder, and The One Thing goal setting. I can work on weekly goals towards a bigger one, leveraging the biggest strengths I have towards the difference-maker. 
* (not saying those will work for you, but they have worked for me. I ignore other PD things. I'd just urge you to lean into that a bit more if you haven't and have an open mind. If you find someone you like, read or listen more. If you don't like who you're consuming, move on without finishing)
* Chasing money is unfulfilling (after a point). I mostly had monetary goals and still do, but as I keep crossing milestone earnings or salaries there's a point where lifestyle, work environment, and happiness are more important. I passed on a job which would have been much more money because it didn't align with those. 
* Don't measure your beginning to someone's middle or end. If you can be motivated by them great, if not give them a mental thumbs up and move on and focus on improving your tomorrow. 
* Never stop learning. I have some privileges that I'm mindful of and I'm sure have helped me - or at least not hindered me. I'm also coachable, competitive, love to learn, and passionate about what I do.
* Celebrate the wins. 
* Find a hobby that's not work-related. 
* /endTedTalk

If you read this far thanks and I hope it's been helpful. I'm bad a celebrating my wins so this is my attempt to do that here in a community that's helped me a lot.",0.711061418056488,Positive,English
2021-08-02,"If you make a decent income, it becomes all about lifestyle creep.","If you make a decent income, it becomes all about lifestyle creep. I spent my career at FAANG (I'm FIRE now) in the Seattle area. I viewed my position as a winning lottery ticket. Anyone at a higher leadership level at a FAANG makes such an insane salary (by a comparison to any normal income) that FI is clearly possible. Since every one of my peers should have made $300k annually or often much more, you would expect that they're all working because they love the work, not because they still need the money.

Even with these high salaries, the majority of my co-workers spent a significant percentage of their income. They would talk about anxiously waiting for a stock vesting to pay off some bills. They'd talk about how their car payment (on their Tesla, or fancy BMW) was almost done, which was a relief because it was hard to make ends meet.

I remember talking to someone who was certainly making 7 figures a year, and had been for years. They said they needed probably another 10+ years to be able to retire, if they could cut down on their expenses. With complete seriousness they said that their third vacation home was probably too expensive, and they needed to really figure out a family budget.

In the end, if you make a ""decent"" income, it is 100% about lifestyle creep. It's not necessarily about living like a college student (e.g. leanfire). Lifestyle creep's impact surprises people. It's not always about a third vacation home. Sometimes it's about the slightly more expensive car, and the slightly more expensive vacation, and the slightly nicer clothes. Next thing you know, you've received lovely 5% a year raises, with 6% a year expense increases. That's digging a hole, not improving your situation.

Anyway, my main point is that income is necessary up to a certain point to be able to achieve FIRE, but the majority of people above that line shoot themselves in the foot all on their own :)",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-07-31,"494k at 27, and Slowing Down on FI","494k at 27, and Slowing Down on FI I was going to write this at the 500k mark but I have some free time now so why not.

My story is common and pretty straightforward. My parents lived the American dream; they grew up poor in developing countries and found success through education and hard work in the US. As they were still poor when I was born, they instilled in me a lot of their values such as sensibility with money. I did well academically at school. For college, I had the opportunity to go to a big state school with a full ride scholarship that covered tuition, room and board for all 4 years. During college, I was the stereotypical shy engineering nerd with who played a ton of computer games, so living expenses were extremely low. I found an internship every summer as well so I graduated with \~20-25k net worth. I didn't know about FI until after college, so unfortunately before this point I had just been putting money in a savings account, with no IRA or brokerage.

Post college, I wanted to do something more interesting, so I got a job with a company in oil and gas. I would spend two weeks on a drilling rig  working 12 hrs a day, and then get two weeks off. I got a company truck/free gas, free phone/cell plan, housing, and an expense account for my food, office supplies, treating the rig crew to dinner etc while at work. There was almost no way for me to spend my own money at work. The pay was pretty good (90-100k a year), and I often volunteered to work during my two weeks off for extra pay. While the official schedule was 50% work days, 50% off days, I calculated I was working closer to 66%-75% of the year. 

For my two weeks off every month, I started traveling a lot. I wanted excitement and to see the world beyond the typical barren wasteland we were drilling for oil in. Although some months I had company training, or I visited my parents, I tried to travel as much as I could. I went mostly internationally; I'd look for cheap flights, or fly free with points. I'd even bank my days off to do 3-4 week trips. Traveling was pretty cheap since I stayed at hostels; $50 a day is more than enough for cheap destinations. Most trips were \~1-2k, although I did go to some expensive places like Hawaii and Switzerland.

While I didn't track my finances that closely, I'd estimate annual spending at $15-20k a year during this period.

* $6k Rent (I rented a $500 bedroom for a  ""home"" to go put my stuff at during days off, very LCOL area)
* $8k Traveling 
* $5k Miscellaneous 

The rest of the money I made went into maxing out 401k/IRA/brokerage. I bought mostly VOO and VTI, with some smaller positions in a couple tech companies.

I started getting bored around 2-3 years in. While I wasn't unhappy with my job, I also wasn't happy with it either. The novelty of traveling and meeting new people around the world started wearing off. I started wanting things money couldn't buy, like stability, permanence, a social life, relationships, and fulfillment. I wasn't learning anything new, or developing myself as a person, just doing the same things over and over again. I had estimated I could reach \~$1 million around 35 years old, which I considered the minimum ""FI"" number, but I didn't see the value in rushing so quickly towards FI at the cost of stagnating my life. I realized that for me, financial independence is not the end destination, but just something I want to achieve along the road to something greater. 

I ended up applying and getting into grad school, fully funded with a \~30k stipend, which I accepted. In a twist of fate, COVID hit, and I got laid off, just before the 4 year mark. Due to the layoff, I was fully vested in my 401k, and received a nice severance package a few months before I was due to resign anyways. 

Been in grad school for over a year now, it's way more work for a fraction of the pay, but I think it's the right decision so far. Continuing some slower progress towards FI while working on other parts of my life.

2021-07-27,$1mm NW at 29 Software Sales FIRE Journey,"$1mm NW at 29 Software Sales FIRE Journey Wanted to share my journey to FIRE and long term plans in case anyone else was curious about options to hit FI fast or FatFIRE without becoming an engineer, lawyer, or going FAANG.  For the majority of my career I’ve worked in software as a service (SaaS) sales.  Jumped around a few times and consistently over performed by working long hours, leveraging my team’s resources to multiply my work, and getting more gray hair than any of my same aged peers. 

Lost my job in December after some management changes, took a sabbatical for 4 months, and started a new one about 4 months ago.  Last gig was mid-market sales and I was driven to be the top rep.  There was a very quarterly driven cadence and I much preferred to work major deals or ones that would feed me in the future.  I succeeded, getting rep of the year in 2019, #1 out of 140 with $6mm in total contract value.  Then I was fired 8 months later for performance. My 2020 numbers slipped with COVID, what have you done for me lately?

The sabbatical put everything into perspective.  Rise and grind is a toxic attitude and taking time away from sales culture made me realize I was addicted to working.  Sales glorifies folks working on their days off, going to ridiculous lengths to close a deal, and spending your money as soon as you get it.  Stories available by request for each.  As the saying goes, a sales manager loves when his reps have a baby, a luxury car payment, and an addiction.  Taking time off then working from home to get away from it made me like myself more as a person.  That said, Sales is absolutely the right career move to get to FIRE as fast as possible without investing years to learn a new skill like coding.  I don’t regret it. 

Now taking a much more laid back approach to work since I realized the stress wasn’t worth it.   New job is Enterprise sales and much more long-term focused.  While the accounts are bigger and the problems more complex, it’s much easier for me to deep dive learn the business of a handful of companies than dozens.  

I can make $400k+ grinding 60+ hours per week including Sundays, riding around in Ubers 7am-8pm for face to face meetings, drinks, and dinners, or I can make $250k-$350k doing it from home starting at 8, cutting out at 5pm (3 on Fridays), going to the gym, and getting a good night sleep.  Competing to be a top performer is stressful.  Chilling out and helping people with the problems they’re explicitly trying to solve is not.  


**Goals**

Retire at 32 so my partner can take an international job which moves around every 2 years and I can get promoted to trophy husband.  I’d like to get to $1.6mm before then, but I’d be ok with doing FIREing at $1.3mm since housing will be taken care of by her gig.  Game plan is to find a fun job to keep me busy 10-20 hours per week, get more serious about a hobby like writing or cooking, or volunteer.  

**My Story**

**2014: Income - $30k.  Assets at EoY - $5k. Spent - Unknown.  Debt - $30k**

Graduated from an instate undergrad in 2013 with $30k of debt. Spent 5 months looking for a job, eventually landed at a branch of a bank opening business bank accounts ,credit cards, etc. Started mid-year at a salary of $45k + Bonus.  Pretty much treading water

**2015: Income - $60k.  Assets at EoY - $10k.  Spent - $36k.  Debt - $20k**

Small raise, left the bank, joined a software company selling data software.  Technical proficiency was a big part of the role and I had a background in statistics from my undergrad, but had to learn the basics of selling over the phone B2B.  Salary of $45k with an on target earnings (OTE) of $76k.  


**2016: Income - $115k  Assets at EoY - $50k.  Spent - $35k.  Debt - $0**

Small raise, but commission really made a big difference.  Used 1 commission check to pay off all of my remaining student debt.  Ended up getting top rep of 120, maxing out my 401k, ESPP, Roth IRA, and getting a few RSUs.  


**2017: Income - $140k.  Assets at EoY - $130k.  Spent - $38k**

New job at a Series A startup with the promise of a $365k OTE and a base of $100k.  Dun goofed, this was not the right spot and I ended up hating it.  After struggling for multiple months I got saddled with the Christian Right Wing vertical where I found a ton of success despite being an LGBT atheist Democrat (political software).  Out of the 16 people I started with in Sales only 7 hadn’t been fired by the CEO or left because they were morally against what the company was doing.  After 2 bosses got fired, the Controller delaying commission checks because “I think you sales people get paid too much,” and having to do deal reviews with an operations director who had no experience selling I knew my time was over here.  Learned not to work at super early stage startups and all the weird rules of back door IRAs.

**2018: Income - $160k.  Assets at EoY - $234k.  Spent - $40.5k**

New job at a best in breed company.  In my first year win a few accolades, speak at our annual kick off conference, and building a solid book of business for next year.  New company offers a mega backdoor 401k, start maxing it out along with the above.  


**2019: Income - $415k.  Assets at EoY - $606k*.  Spent: $42.5k**

Things come together.  Close my first $1mm+ deal, then closed another one 8 months later.  Tons of accolades, talks of big promotions, and lots of prestige.  My partner started grad school so my rent went up significantly.

* I think this number might have pulled forward some of the last few years assets since I did a bunch of consolidation and Mint doesn’t do well with this sort of thing.  


**2020: Income - $340k.  Assets at EoY: $880k.  Spent - $44.5k**

Offered a promotion in January, but turned it down for a variety of personal and professional reasons.  Tax man cometh, owed 35k in April.  Verbally offered a much bigger promotion I planned to accept in July which ultimately a new VP blocked.  That should have been the writing on the wall, but I had a rough half because of COVID and was recently let go.  That evening a C-suite client I’d been working with texted and emailed me asking if I was ok and immediately offered to connect me with his sales leadership if I wanted a job.  


**2021: Income: Tracking for $250k, assets today: $1mm.  Spent - On track for $45.5k**

Received competing offers from 2 companies, one a start up and one a well established player.  Decided I was done with the stress that comes with building a team so took the established player despite it being $15k less.  Negotiated a 4 month sabbatical so I could unwind.  Spent that time hiking, reading (up to 43 books so far this year), practicing my hobbies like chess, handwriting (was chicken scratch), working out, and cooking.  Travelled a little, spent a ton of time with my family, recorded an interview with my mom about her childhood (favorite part), and visited my partner at grad school.  New job is good, though it has it’s bullshit.  Tax Man Cometh again.  Owed the IRS $35k in 2021.  Partner got a job that should lead us to living abroad in a few years when I retire.


**Spending:**

Tended to live on the road for work so got all of my weeknight dining and happy hours (entertainment or peer coaching) taken care of by the company.  Pre-COVID almost all the companies I’ve worked for provided breakfast and lunch.  All the same my partner and I like to do a fancy dinner once a quarter and take out once a week.  We’ve gotten a free vacation from my work 3/6 years which we like to extend.  On the years we don’t we’ve done a reasonably priced vacation of about $1000-$2000/person almost always paid for with points. 


**Lifestyle Inflation:**

I’m a regular at a local watering hole that used to cost $4/beer when I moved here and now charges $12.  Rent has gone up because I used to live with my partner but she’s in grad school.  When I moved here I was paying $750/month, now it’s $2,000/month.  When I first graduated making ~50k/year I lived on about $32k after taxes.  Last year after making 340k I spent $44k.  Now that my partner is back I’ll probably land closer to $35-$40k per year.


Over the last 3 years I purchased 2 luxury watches that set me back a total of $51k.  Had both of them assessed this weekend and was offered a total of $74k.  Selling on the private market they’re worth closer to $93k.  These purchases were excluded from my annual spend metrics since they represent one-off purchases and would completely skew the numbers.  


Overall I could have definitely spent less on food, booze, and toys.  Know I could keep grinding at this and have $10m+ after 20 years, but I think 50 year old me would want the 20 years of freedom more.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-07-17,Is there a correlation between pursuing FI/RE and CF (child-free lifestyle)?,"Is there a correlation between pursuing FI/RE and CF (child-free lifestyle)? It has been proved many times that FI/RE is possible for almost every person with average or slightly average income (not discussing fatFIRE or $200k+ salaries) in a reasonable timeframe. It could be even easier for a couple, both committed to this goal by sharing their expenses. 

But how are kids fitting into FI/RE calculations? 

I have come up with following:

1. you will have +1, +2, +3 mouths to feed/clothe/care about
2. you will need a bigger house, car, extra furniture and all stuff associated with household
3. electricity, water, gas bills will be higher
4. at certain kids age (let's say 12 years and up) you will face a difficult challenge of explaining to them that they will probably never have what their classmates or friends have (new cell phones, wardrobe, fancy stuff - teenagers are expensive). Yes, it makes sense to YOU to not buy such things, but try to explain this to a teenager, who seeks his place in the world amongst his peers. (I think there is a high risk of building low self-esteem and there is also a high risk of not being accepted by his/her social group if they are ""economically different"")
5. I think every parent wants a better future for his children. They want to see their children happy and successful. Again, this will need some monetary effort - be it high school/university expenses or simply ""life experiences"" I am afraid that reading books from the library or hiking trips (which both are perfectly fine for FI/RE couple) will be just not enough for teenage life explorer.
6. After your kids will finish high school/university - ask yourself - do you want to let them grind their way up from zero / maybe even with college debt? That probably means - do you want them to start as you started or do you want to give them some headstart?

My conclusion is that points 1-3 from this list can be quite easily measured and will probably add very few extra years before you can FI/RE.

But the remaining 4-6 points are difficult to measure, chances are very high that they will have an even bigger impact on your FI/RE target date, in some cases making it almost impossible. 

So if you are at the beginning of pursuing FI/RE - young, working and solo, it is easy. Then you probably want to find your significant other, who shares your dream too - this could be harder, but in the grand scheme of things it is also the easy part. It is having kids where things are starting to complicate.

So my question is: **Have you decided to be child-free to make FI/RE possible for you?** Or do you count with kids in your FI/RE plans (not fatFIRE, no $200k+ salary)? In that case, how are you willing to addresss points 4-6?

2021-07-09,My half year 2021 financial update after over 10 years post FIRE,"My half year 2021 financial update after over 10 years post FIRE Quick disclaimer since these posts sometimes get hate. This isn't meant a s a humble brag or a comparison to anyone else. This is strictly provided to the FIRE community because I know I would have liked to have seen real world example of how people handle their finances when I was trying to figure all this out many years ago. Another reason I post these is to show there is more than one way to do FIRE. I was able to accomplish this without ever making a high income during my working years. I simply lived very frugally and put the money I saved into individual stocks (hey, it was 80s - 90s...I didn't know better and stock investing was a completely different animal back then) and then converted that to buying rental properties in a low cost of living area in the 2000s. 

Quick stats: I'm 55, single, no kid's, about 10 years post FIRE. 

&#x200B;

**INCOME**

Total net income through the first 6 months of the year. 

$61,036

That breaks down as follows. 

$54,300 Net Income from rentals (Mostly reinvested)

$1500 from dividends from my broad market index funds (100% reinvested)

$4442 from dividends from my high dividend portfolio (100% reinvested) 

$794 from dividends from Fundrise (100% reinvested)

&#x200B;

**GROWTH AND NET WORTH**

My growth in my investments so far 

High Dividend Stock account  began the year at $98,892. I invest $100 per day into it. It currently is at $142,581

Broad Market Index fund account began the year at $193,640. I invest $200 per day into it. It currently is at $299,233

My Fundrise account started the year at $44,479. I invested a total of $4000 so far this year. It is currently at $53,124

My real estate (rentals) is very difficult to estimate since I have partners on some of the houses and some I own outright. Not to mention it isn't a liquid asset. I usually just judge it by the income it produces...that being said it does have a value that adds to my net worth. I'll be conservative and say my real estate portfolio is worth $1.5M, although the amount I've invested into it is well under $500k. 

My personal property is worth about $350k - $400k

I have misc. accounts totaling around $40K...this is a small Acorn account, and my liquid accounts that I use for personal and business expenses. I keep more in a ""cash"" bank account than most because I need to cover business expenses. I try to keep around $20K in there, but it will fluctuate greatly throughout the month to as low as $7 or 8K, to sometimes as high as $30k. I currently have another $15k in a money market fund. I have this for quick liquidity when needed. This also varies greatly and will be as high as $50K at times. 

Not going to bother with my cars and other misc. on this update. This brings my total net worth as of this update to around  $2,384,393 

**EXPENSES**

In the first half of the year I've spent a total of $5708 on all non business related expenses. This is a little higher than I budget for...I would be well under budget on my basic expenses, but there was a car repair in there that blew it. My fixed monthly expenses break down like this

Phone/Internet $25 (Visible wireless with unlimited hotspot for internet)

Insurance on my cars $45 (3 cars liability only)

Food/groceries $100 (I've done some detailed food budget breakdowns if you're curious how I keep this so low)

Electric $150 (average throughout the year/ all electric house)

Gas for cars $50

Health Insurance is a free (for now) catastrophic plan. Thanks to all my real estate deductions I get to write off most of my income, leaving me just able to qualify for the absolute worst plan available in my state for free. Of course, if one little thing goes wrong at tax time and I step over the threshold at the end of the year, that could change and I'll be left paying for a plan I've never used. 

That brings me to $370, that give me another $430 for any one time expenses that come up. I like my yearly spending to stay under $10K, but if I go over I'm not freaking out. I've been able to stay on budget with my personal spending for many, many years now, though! 

I think that covers where things are now. 

**WHY DON'T I SPEND MORE?**

I get asked this a lot. Why am I still trying to accumulate wealth 10 years after I retired? Well, I'm still relatively young, and I have some big future goals that includes a large animal sanctuary with its own vet clinic and vegan restaurant. Even though I already have about 40 acres lined up for it, it is going to take a long time to get all the infrastructure in place.  It might be 5 -10 years before it actually opens. I'm hoping to build as much as I can in the meantime. 

I'm also just frugal by nature. Most of the stuff I enjoy is free or nearly free. Hiking trails, video games, TV, movies, diving down rabbit holes of whatever interest me at the time, etc. Some of my hobbies even makes me money. I've managed to buy cars that appreciate. I happen to be a decent poker player. My watches have done really well...same with my art collection. 

I don't live like a pauper. I live alone in a 4000 sq ft Mid Century house built into a cliff overlooking a river and beautiful valley with an indoor pool...so don't think my frugality always comes at the cost of the finer things. It is true until I recently bought my dream house I lived in a very modest house most people wouldn't associate with a millionaire (that house now rents for $650 a month), but I was patient and wanted to find the perfect house before I bothered to move. As I briefly mentioned before I have nice things like collector cars, art, watches, etc....I just try to spend as little as possible on depreciating assets or things like food. I appreciate good food, but being vegan makes it hard to eat out in my area. That is probably an understatement. There are maybe a handful of places I can eat at all, and most of those only have one or two items on the menu I can eat. So I'd rather prepare great meals at home from cheap ingredients. I've gone into details in other posts about how I shop and prepare food, so won't make this post any longer doing it again.

As always, I'll try to answer any questions you might have. Thanks for reading such a long post!!",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-07-08,Six Months of Direct Indexing,"Six Months of Direct Indexing Direct indexing is buying all the component stocks to build your own personal index, rather than just buying shares of a  professionally-managed index fund, or paying a robo advisor to manage a portfolio for you.

Why would you do this?

1. Tax loss harvesting.  If you buy an index fund and the index  goes up, you have no tax losses.  If you buy all the stocks in the index and the index goes up overall, you will find that you still have some losers, which you can sell (within wash sale rules) to harvest tax losses, while you keep the winners.

2. Control.  Index funds buy what the index they follow says to buy.  Robo advisors buy whatever their code says to buy.  If you don't want to own certain companies for whatever reason, you're out of luck having someone else manage your money unless you find an index manager who shares your exact preferences.  Maybe you want to own the actual 500 largest companies by market cap, instead of whichever 500 companies the S&P 500 happened to pick based on their various criteria.  Maybe you don't want to own alcohol or tobacco or oil companies.  I don't know what you want, but if you are sufficiently picky you'll probably want to micromanage your holdings.

3. Low costs.  Brokers now have free trades and fractional shares, so it's quite possible to build your own index for free, as long as you stick to stocks that don't have foreign settlement fees.  Of course, many index funds are also
very cheap and a few are free.  Robo advisors are more expensive.


Why wouldn't you do this?

1. Buying an index fund is much easier than buying hundreds of stocks, though it costs you the ability to harvest tax losses efficiently.  Using a robo advisor will get you easy tax loss harvesting, if you're willing to pay about 0.25% of your assets every year in fees.

2. Buying and selling lots of stocks makes your taxes more complicated.

3. Owning lots of stocks means you get a lot of email.  Every time some company has an annual meeting or a special dividend, someone lets you know.

4. Some stocks are difficult or expensive to buy and sell.  You probably aren't allowed to buy Saudi Aramco stock at all.  You probably don't want to set up an account on the South Korean exchange to buy Samsung stock.  You probably don't want to pay $50 foreign settlement fees on any stock, especially if you're buying small enough amounts that $50 is significant.  You probably don't want 100 or more shares of a stock that's only sold in large blocks.  You might not want even one whole share of a high-share-price stock that your broker doesn't
allow buying fractional shares of.  So while in theory you have the ability to pick whichever stocks you want, in practice your broker may be able to get some stocks you can't easily buy yourself, so you might still want to hold some index funds for extra diversification.


What are the mechanics of building a direct index?

1. Pick what index you want to follow.  Find a reliable, regularly-updated source for what goes in that index.  If you want to invent your own index, write down what its rules are in advance, so you'll know you're actually indexing rather than stock picking.

2. Decide how much money you want to invest in the index.

3. Decide how you will weight stocks within your index.  Cap-weighted is the easiest way to go, because it's mostly self-maintaining as stock prices fluctuate.  But if you really want an equal-weighted index, you can do it; just know that you'll need to do a lot more buying and selling if you want to keep
it balanced as prices change.

4. Decide whether you want a new brokerage account just for this index or you want to use an existing account.  You'll want to use a broker with free trades, fractional shares, and a user interface that scales to owning hundreds or thousands of stocks.  If you're a programmer, you may prefer a broker that
allows automating trades, though of course a bug in your automated trading code could lose you money, so you might prefer to do things manually.

5. Decide how often you want to harvest tax losses.  If you want to minimize work, then once per year is the way to go: sell all your losers in December, wait 31 days to make sure you don't have any wash sales, then buy replacement stock.  If you pay quarterly estimated taxes and want to generate tax losses
quarterly then you can sell losers once a quarter instead of once a year.  If you want to be a compulsive market watcher and sell for tax losses anytime something is down and you've held it long enough to avoid wash sales, you can do that.  If you buy or sell more often than once every 31 days, you'll have to pay attention to wash sales.

6. Decide what to do about dividends.  You can set them to automatically re-invest in the same stock that produced the dividend, or you can leave them in cash to manually re-invest or withdraw.


My personal experience with direct indexing:

I initially decided to make a cap-weighted index of about the 500 biggest companies, leaving out the ones I strongly disliked for various reasons (your call whether that's Socially Responsible Investing or just stock picking), my own employer's stock (to avoid violating their trading window rules), and the ones I couldn't easily and affordably buy.  I decided to try to own one billionth of each company, because round numbers make the math easy.  (So, for example, #1 Apple's market cap is $2.335T, so I should own $2335 of AAPL.  #499
Paychex's market cap is $39.12B, so I should own $39.12 of PAYX.)  I decided to harvest tax losses whenever I felt like it, and reinvest dividends manually.  And I decided that if I had spare cash I would prefer to grow the index beyond the 500 biggest companies, rather than buying larger chunks of each company I already had in the index.

I started building my index on January 4, the first day the market was open in 2021.  I had enough cash in my account to buy one-billionth of about the biggest 400 companies.  I did this totally manually: opened https://companiesmarketcap.com in one browser window, loaded up my brokerage site in another browser window, and started clicking buy.  It was a lot of clicking, and I was using limit orders that didn't all succeed, so it actually took me a few days to spend my allocated money.  By the time I was done, I owned a billionth or so of most of the 400 biggest companies.  (Not all, because some companies are hard or expensive to buy.)

I mostly left my index alone until the end of March, other than a few small purchases as dividend money trickled in.  But then quarterly estimated taxes were due, and I had taken some capital gains (in transactions not related to this index) in Q1 and needed to pay estimated taxes on those gains to avoid a
penalty later, so I decided to sell all my losers, both to reduce my Q1 gains and to raise cash to send to the IRS.  94 of my stocks had gone down in Q1, generating $1780 of tax losses.  The others were up, so I wanted to let those gains ride rather than selling and needing to pay taxes on them.

At this point, my index had become a lot more complicated.  Rather than owning roughly the top 400 stocks by market cap, I now owned about 3/4 of them, and needed to avoid buying back the others for at least 31 days to avoid wash sales.  I started to get tired of paging back and forth through my transaction log to manually figure out what I could buy next, so I decided to write a program to do it for me.

Basically, I manually download two CSV files from my broker: one with my current holdings and another one with all my stock sales so far this year.  And I can scrape a site to find the top n companies by market cap, which is what I want to own.  Then the logic is basically to find what I own that's down and tell me to consider selling it, then find the biggest companies that I
don't own enough of and tell me to consider buying them.  Pretty straightforward, except for avoiding wash sales.  The easy way to avoid wash sales is just to never recommend buying or selling anything that I've bought or sold in the last 30 days.  (This isn't quite the perfect logic, as not all shares are replacement shares, but it errs on the side of caution, so it's good enough.)

Armed with this software, since depleting my index to pay Q1 estimated taxes, I've gradually built the index back up to about the biggest 1100 companies. (Except the ones that are hard or expensive to buy, that I don't want to own, or that I've sold for a tax loss recently and can't buy back yet.)  And I've also aggressively sold losers whenever I get bored.  At this point my index has generated $2003 of tax losses through the first half of the year.  What's left is up $4809.  And I have $46056 of stock in the index.

So what's the value of a tax loss?  It depends on your personal tax situation.  In 2021 I expect to have lots of long-term capital gains to offset, in the 15% plus 3.8% plus 5.75% (state) capital gains bracket, or 24.55% total.  So $2003 of tax losses saves me about $492 on my taxes this year.  In addition the $4809 of capital gains are mine, but I'll have to pay taxes on them someday.  If I wait a year for long-term capital gains, and wait until a lower-income year so I don't owe the 3.8% surcharge,
I'll owe 20.75% (15% + 5.75%) tax on them, so I'll get to keep $3811 of the gains.  So the total after-tax value of the first six months of direct indexing will be about $4303.

If I'd bought a low-cost index fund covering approximately the same kinds of stocks like VFIAX or VOO instead, I'd have about the same gains (there is some tracking error but I don't think it's very predictable or systematic, so call it a wash on average), but not the benefit of tax loss harvesting, so I'd
probably have about $3811 after tax.  So basically the benefit of doing this is the $492 of tax loss harvesting.

If I'd used a robo advisor instead, figure they would have given me about the same gains and tax loss harvesting, but I'd have had to pay 0.25% in fees, or about $115.  So in this particular case, if I value my time at zero, direct indexing is better than a robo advisor which is better than a fund.  However, if I spent a dozen hours on this project, then the $115 I saved by not paying a robo advisor would mean I valued my own time at less than $10 per hour. Chipotle pays $13.50 per hour in my town, so clearly it was not economically rational for me to spend time running a small direct index.  If I did not enjoy
running a direct index or learn anything from doing it, I'd be better off paying a robo advisor.  However, I did enjoy it, and it was a learning experience, and I should be able to increase the size of my index and maintain it in fewer hours in the future.  So it was worth doing, for me.

In summary, if you want to run your own index, you can.  But if it doesn't seem like fun to you, index funds and robo advisors are totally reasonable alternatives.  Nobody has to do this.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-07-08,My Fire Journey so Far (24M) 65k NW - 55k Income,"My Fire Journey so Far (24M) 65k NW - 55k Income Hello everyone

First post, been lurking for while. Thought id share my journey so far as I enjoy reading other peoples experiences, journeys, backgrounds ect. Also People tend to enjoy moderate income (I think I might even be low income for SoCAL) stories.

# Background -

24M living in southern California. Parents immigrated to the US late 1980s, dad works his tail off in his construction business, mom part time teacher.

2014- Graduated High school, average grades, went to community college to start my higher education with a business degree.

# First Job -

2015 - Got a full time job at a retail store, Was making good money at 19 years old, about 30-40k while going to community college. Spent every penny I earned on new clothes, gadgets, going out, ect. Was being trained for managerial position, but corporate politics made me repulsed so I left.

March 2017 I left my retail job and starting working for my families construction company, starting as a AutoCAD draftsman, taking a decent Paycut as I was working about 30 hours a week and making less (had a lot to learn). Fall 2017, After my 2 years in Community college I transferred to an affordable University to finish my degree in business. I was lucky enough to have my parents cash flow my education, all in all from A-Z it costed just under 20k, and lucky enough to live at home during all this time while I was blowing my money on stupid stuff. Somewhere in the middle of this I bought a new Car with a payment of $525. Throughout this time I was not making very much, and between car payment and being bad with money, I had about 1k to my name + car debt. I was 21 at this point.

Summer 2018, I lemoned my new car, got about 10k out of it and went to buy myself my dream car along with a $434 monthly payment, man I love that car! Young and enjoying life for sure, it was just before my 22nd birthday. Had a few thousand to my name, but 23k in car debt.

2019- Got my degree, started to be a little better with money. No significant raises up until October 2019, making about 55k at this point, started saving some money all of 2019 and getting my act together.

# The Turning point -

Jan 1st 2020, had exactly 0 NW. had 17k in my bank, owed 17k on my Car. making 55k. Starting investing right before Covid around Feb 2020, and invested throughout the dips as much as I could. Around June 2020 our company split in half, and my responsibilities went up dramatically as we where trying to the company back on its feet. I was working more and essentially being the 2nd man in the construction Business. Income stayed the same as the company was not in a financial position to request more.

August 2020 I moved out with my Girlfriend, adding $1100 rent + utilities and living expenses to my monthly expenses. I sitll owed about 10k on my car, but throughout staying the course and buying the dips, I had 30k invested at this point. was chipping away at the car debt until on March 2021, I paid off my beloved Vehicle. A month later sold it for a more practical daily car, and pocketed 10k due to the crazy used car market. Sold it for 4k less than i bought it, after 3 years and 40k miles. It hurt, I love that car, but I had to make the right choice. My commute is about 400 miles a week in so cal traffic, between gas, driving a manual and 2 fender benders ( neither my fault) it was the right move.

# Today -

Here I am now, July 2021 with the following NW-

Paid for car - 18k

Emergency fund - 11k

Crypto - 4k

IRA + Brokerage - 32k (VTSAX VIGAX mainly, couple tesla shares)

Total NW - 65k.

Overall, im proud of myself for going 0 - 65k in 18months on a modest 55k income in southern californa. Im grateful for the headstart I was given by my parents, but also grateful I wasnt a total idiot during this time. I Guess the main takeaway from the post is - its not how much you make, its what you do with how much you make.

If this interests anyone at all I will do an update on my NW journey end of this year, hoping to be at 80k!

Feel free to ask any questions, im not the best at explaining things like this so I apologize ahead of time.

2021-07-06,First Quarterly Update / Q2 2021 / You gotta start somewhere,"First Quarterly Update / Q2 2021 / You gotta start somewhere 
I’ve been motivated to start doing these updates since I was first interested in the FI/RE movement in the middle of last year. I always held back because I never felt like I was “good enough” or that my updates would be interesting enough.

But now I’m debt free and have no more excuses. I think this sub could benefit from the voice of a low-average income earner at the ‘beginning’ of their FI journey. 



Backstory: 

I am a US citizen who was living in the UK before moving to Australia. I came to Oz in April 2019 on a Working Holiday Visa with a backpack full of clothes, 2000£, and about 10k USD in credit card debt. I had just finished backpacking around SE Asia after finishing the in-class portion of my Masters degree and decided I wanted to spend my time writing my thesis in Australia. I landed in Brisbane and was only supposed to stay for the weekend to visit a friend….but I never left. I ended up apply for a temp 6-month contract on a whim my first night and ended up getting the job. 

April - December 2019 

My first 6 months in Australia were just focused on writing my masters, having fun, and working. I’ve always been naturally frugal and have never watched my finances much. I ended up saving about ~5k during my contract and left there in December 2020 to go complete my regional work to qualify for my second year holiday visa. 

January - March 2020

I moved up north to an island off the coast of Queensland to work at a holiday “resort” full time for 200$/week. This was almost exactly how much it costs to pay the minimum on my credit cards. It was a rough 3 months. March 23rd 2020 I was laid off with the rest of hospitality staff around Australia. I took the first plane back yo Brisbane and moved in with my partner at his mothers house to wait out lockdown. 

March - October 2020

My partner thankfully kept his job throughout lockdown. We were living off his 72k salary and I was paying my credit cards/phone bill/gym fees/personal items with my savings for my first job. I spent 7 months applying to multiple jobs every day, going to countless interviews and being rejected. This was the time I started to become interested in budgeting and, through that, the FIRE movement. During this time I took on all of the household and financial duties. I took control of our budget and we were able to save ~200$/week living off of my partners salary. 

October 2020 to now

I finally landed a full time job in October and have been there since. The pay isn’t great and I’m way overqualified but I am happy to have a stable income and there is a lot of room for growth. I don’t hate working, my main motivation because FIRE is to be able to devote my time to traveling and more humanitarian focused careers. 



Updates for Q2:

Paid off debt:

In the first two quarters of 2021 I paid almost 13 thousand dollars to debt. 

* Credit card debt - 8,229.04 AUD 

This was a mixture of my phone, master’s tuition, london living, and overflow from my undergrad years that I just never paid off. This was my top concern as I did a balance transfer and only had 6 months to pay it off before it went up to 23% interest. I paid this off in February. 

* Personal debt - 4725 AUD

This was half the cost of my visa to stay in Australia (partner visa) and a small personal loan of money my partner lent me when I got my job as I needed professional clothes and shoes before working in an office environment. 

Raiz: 

I put my first amount of money towards shares in my name! It’s not much, but every week I transfer some as a motivation to not spend all my personal money. (The VDHG is under my partners name while I figured out my tax issues) 

PFIC/taxes: 

I spent the last month researching how I can invest while being a US expatriate. The laws are very convoluted and gave me a head on more than one occasion. On top of that, many online brokers don’t accept US citizens ( e.g. Selfwealth) or require a minimum net worth that I don’t meet (e.g. interactive brokers) I know that Raiz is not a great investment for me because it has punitive taxes associated with it since they are not US domicile funds. However, I recently came across Stake and will hopefully be using that as my main brokerage going forward. 



Goals:

* Buy a PPOR: rent for our flat will probably be going up at least 50$ a week when we renew our lease in February. We’ve come to decide that we would like a stable place to live that we don’t have to worry about rent changing or being kicked out by landlords. Also…I want a dog. 

* Start a 529/UTMA for my niece & nephew: education is very important to me. My family is working poor and will never be able to afford to send the to university without getting into extreme amounts of debt. 

* Find a US/AU tax specialist in Brisbane who deals with people with minuscule net worth.

2021-07-05,FIRE in one of the most expensive countries in the world as a 25yo couple.,"FIRE in one of the most expensive countries in the world as a 25yo couple. EDIT: Thank you for the comments - I think I have likely overstated the cost of living here compared to other countries. My points around housing stand, but it seems that NZ is closer to US/Europe in general cost of goods/services than I previously thought! I feel that on a median basis a New Zealander may not be far off an American or European standard and cost of living. One big difference being that Kiwis can't really move to a LCOL area as easily as Americans can. We don't have a Midwest, or cheaper souther states to do ""geographical arbitrage"" like some people talk about in this sub. Income trajectory is also worse here in my opinion. The median wage for the US will include many millions of people who live in these LCOL States, for which there is little equivalent here. Thanks again for the feedback - I have learned a lot :) 

&#x200B;

**Cost of living in New Zealand**

First  I’d like to paint a bit of a picture of the cost of living in our  country. In addition to generally expensive goods, we are in the midst  of the largest housing “bubble” in the world. Housing is widely  considered to be a national crisis, and due to long running net  immigration into New Zealand, there are some big question marks over  what might happen when the borders re-open. With some bold predictions  (article about house prices doubling in 5 years). Past and present  governments have been ineffective at moderating our rapidly increasing  house and rent prices. Taxes are also high compared to the US (I  think?). I am currently paying an effective tax rate of 27%.

Here  is a table of some common items and their cost. I haven’t picked these  to show any particular disparity with the US or other countries, but I  thought they might highlight some interesting differences. For  reference, the average annual household income in New Zealand is  $107,000 ($75,000 USD). I believe this is more than the US average, but  this difference would almost certainly be closed due to the astronomical  cost of living here.

&#x200B;

|Item|Price in NZD|USD Equivalent|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Levis 501|$140|$90 (Actual price \~$50 on Levi store)|
|1 litre of fuel|$2.10|$5.35 a gallon|
|iPhone 12 base model|$1,499 NZ Apple Store|$1049 (Actual price $699 on Apple Store)|

&#x200B;

[Here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iZy7vITQMlKc/v0/1000x-1.png) is a picture that can hopefully put our insane housing situation into perspective.

**I should also point out some of the financial pros of living here.**

Medical  costs are significantly lower than in the US. Reading posts on this  subreddit about people who have achieved FIRE but continue working  solely for the medical insurance boggles my mind. We pay around $215 a  month for private health insurance – which we don’t even necessarily  need. One of us recently had surgery at a private hospital that would  have cost $35,000. This was completely paid for by the government –  irrespective of our insurance situation.

We  both have degrees and student loans. Our loans are interest free for  the life of the loan. If we move overseas then we will have to pay  interest (at 4% I believe). Loan repayments are automatically garnished  from your wages, after an initial repayment free threshold of \~$20k a  year. The government provides a living cost supplement to students at  university – to be repaid. Those who can demonstrate a low enough  household income (parents) can receive a non-repayable student allowance  of $240 a week. This system is flawed however, as it assumes that  parents over a certain income threshold are helping their children  financially through university – which is not always the case.

**Our situation:**

I  grew up in a single parent household with two other siblings. My mother  was incredibly disciplined with money – keeping handwritten budgets and  tracking expenditure religiously. This was out of necessity, but I  believe it laid the groundwork for my relationship with money. From a  very young age I recall wanting to be wealthy when I was older. Mostly  from the point of view of having stability and security over my life  situation. I had a head for numbers and had various “side hustles”  throughout my youth – at one point bulk buying Mentos and re-selling  them at school.

I was lucky enough  to stumble into the FIRE movement very early. I cannot remember the  exact age when I came across ""that"" Mr Money Moustache article, but I  may have been 20 at the time. I was saving and investing throughout  university of my own volition but with no particular goal in mind. The  concepts of FIRE appealed to me immediately, and I switched focus to  trying to GTFO of the workforce ASAP.

My  partner grew up the youngest of 5 siblings. Money was tight in the  house – homemade food was common, taking advantage of what was grown in  the garden or purchased in bulk and frozen for later. Her father was  self-employed which meant a variable household income. During university  she was working up to five jobs at a time, so that sets a picture of  the sort of work ethic she has.

**Work History:**

We  both started our careers as graduates at consulting firm working in the  Risk Management area. After a couple of years, we both moved to the  same company. A short time later we moved jobs again, after which I  moved once more to where I am now. I am a firm believer in frequent  career moves to accelerate your earning potential. The below chart  reflects this. I would say that we are on very good money for our age.  New Zealand certainly has a lower ceiling on earnings compared to the  US. Making $100k USD would be rare, although we are lucky enough to  potentially hit that number soon. Some of the figures you see on this  sub (e.g. $250k USD) are almost unattainable here, perhaps outside of  specialised medical personnel, C-suite execs, and partners at law firms,  etc. But we all know that FIRE attracts a lot of confirmation bias and  high tech salaries.

**Our Housing bubble ride:**

We  were incredibly lucky to purchase our first home in 2019 for $690k  ($484k USD). It is a 100sqm (1076 square foot) three-bedroom house. Most  young people in New Zealand have dwindling hopes of ever owning their  own home. For an individual on the median wage, rent will absorb a  significant percentage of income, to the point where saving for a  deposit on a house is nearly impossible. The current climate is that  only well-paid couples, those with significant help from parents, or  very high income individuals are capable of purchasing a home. We fell  into the first bucket, and benefited from years of savings even at a  young age at the time of purchase. This is the reality of our current  housing market that you essentially have to be frugal and a high earner  from the second you hit adulthood if you want a hope of owning, and even  that will likely not be enough as prices continue to soar.

In  less than two years the current value of our property is $950k ($667k  USD). We have purchased a second home that is yet to be built, and we  intend to sell our current property when we move. We have no intention  of being landlords or property investors, as this simply feeds into the  current crisis. The proceeds from this sale will be put into index  funds, as well as financing the new house.

**Other investments:**

We follow the usual strategy of investing in low-cost diversified index funds. Mostly VOO.

**Lifestyle:**

We  are generally very frugal. My partner budgets but I do not. Despite  food being very expensive here, our weekly spend for groceries is about  $140 ($97 USD). This is quite low compared to other people I have asked.  We do not eat out; we make our own lunches for work and always have  done. I think I can count on two hands the number of times I have  purchased lunch since I started working in 2017. We own one car which is  paid in full, although we are upgrading to a brand-new car later in the  year to take advantage of a government subsidy for electric vehicles  and hybrids (we will get $5750 back). I would consider this to be one of  the first intentionally not-great financial decisions we’ve made. But  we are in a spot where we can afford it, and it is part of planning for  our future.

Hobbies are relatively  low cost and high repeatability – things like gaming, yoga, running,  gardening, reading, hiking. We travel domestically quite a bit,  particularly for road trips and hiking. COVID has obviously put a halt  on any international travel.

**The future:**

One  unique aspect of FIRE in New Zealand is the prospect of having a  freehold home. It is entirely feasible that we could have \~$2mil NW but  still be paying a significant mortgage. One potential solution will be  to move to a cheaper area of the country (there aren’t many) and try to  go no-debt.

We plan to continue  building our index investments. I am particularly keen on holding VOO,  or other international investments, as it acts as an inflation hedge in a  worst-case scenario if the NZ economy continues on its current path.

Many  young Kiwis are looking overseas for better earning prospects. A common  path is for young people to move overseas to advance their careers and  savings, and to then come back and buy a home. We plan to travel, and  possibly work in another country, but we are in a good spot in terms of  earnings so this is not as much of a priority for us.

As  property owners, we are likely to see continued growth in our home(s)  value. Our current equity forms a significant portion of our net worth,  and is part of the reason for wanting to sell in order to lock in the  “gains” and diversify. In New Zealand we have been talking about “when  the bubble pops” since the 90s, and at this point it seems inevitable  that house prices will continue to increase. We are the perfect storm of  a small country with limited land but huge immigration demand due to  our perception on the world stage. Not to mention the historic  underinvestment and poor planning by government and city councils around  good property development practices. Our generation is feeling the  pinch, and we are part of the lucky few who will benefit from this  continued crisis.

**The figures:**

I have been tracking my net worth for exactly 6 years. My partner for \~2 years (we are the same age).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Looking  at these figures it becomes clear that the bull market (both shares and  housing) of 2020 has had an enormous impact on our net worth. We did  well off some stock picks during the COVID market recovery, but now it’s  back to nothing but VOO. The house price growth in particular is  practically a windfall in terms of size and its sudden appearance. My  hope is that once this is reinvested into index funds that it serves as  the foundation of more sustainable portfolio growth for the future. The  common saying around these parts is that the first $100k is the hardest,  and I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that we essentially blew  through the first $100k and into $400k+ in a single year.

I  also feel that these numbers downplay our savings efforts in some way.  My early net worth fluctuation was due to being over-invested in a small  number of highly volatile companies, and the figure was weighed down by  $40k+ in student loan debt. Combined we have paid down more than $50k  in student loan debt already. Although I have not tracked it, I have  likely averaged a 40% savings rate at a minimum. I think that even  without the house purchase and subsequent price rise, we would be in a  pretty admirable position – although those USD figures don’t look as  impressive…

**To conclude:**

I  suppose the purpose of this post is to provide some insight into what  FIRE can look like outside of US/Europe, and also to talk about our  insane housing market. If we were doing comparable jobs in the US I  believe our journey to FI would be substantially shorter, but despite  the cost of living (and in fact due to our privilege of being able to  pursue FIRE in such a HCOL country) we are very happy to be where we  are. Maybe this post can give some info for all of those hopeful  immigrants who think NZ is simply the land of milk and honey! We do have  a lot to be grateful for here, but financially it can be a tough  situtaion for many people.",-0.5106993317604065,Negative,English
2021-06-29,Part 2 of My Guide To Hedgefundie's Portfolio for FIRE/FatFire/WhaleFire,"Part 2 of My Guide To Hedgefundie's Portfolio for FIRE/FatFire/WhaleFire I ran into Reddit's 40,000 character limit on the first post and this post. Sadly Reddit's character limit includes hyper links. I wasn't able to explain everything I wanted in the first post so here's Part 2 of My Guide. 

This will be the last time I write a guide about this strategy. [Please read the first guide if you're new to this portfolio.](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/o7tnm5/my_guide_to_hedgefundies_portfolio_and_why_im_100/)

Again, this portfolio is throwing 55% on UPRO and 45% on TMF. Both are 3x leveraged ETFs. If you do basic math, you have a portfolio of 3 * 55% S&P 500 stocks = 165% and a portfolio of 3 * 45% of 20+ year long term US treasury bonds. This portfolio produces explosive returns with drawdowns being close to the risk of being in 100% stocks.

I'm 100% invested all-in this portfolio.

The second guide is going to answer a lot of common questions I saw come up in the original thread along with more graphs and supporting data to back why certain parts of this strategy works. I'm not going to repeat myself with information that's found in the first post. 

I expect you to have read the first guide before proceeding forward with the second part. 

# Rethinking Risk with the Futures Equivalent Portfolio

What is this portfolio if we think of it in terms of trading S&P 500 futures (/ES) and 25-30 year UltraBond Futures(/UB)? 

When I originally wrote this post SPX is at 4,280.70, and /UB is quoted at $190`00 on Friday June 25 2021. 

/ES has a 50x contract multiplier so each contract of ES is equivalent to 50 x 4280.70 = $214,035 worth of the S&P 500.

/UB delivers 100 of $1,000 face value basket of 25-30 year US bonds. In other words you can redeem these bonds for $100,000 which is the contract size. A quote of $190 means at expiration you will be paying $190,000 for this basket of bonds from the futures seller.

Our portfolio is 165% stocks and 135% 20+ year US treasuries. 

Let's start with /ES. We will divide $214,035 by 1.65 and get  $129,718 per contract.
Now let's start with /UB. We will divide $190,000 by 1.35 and get $140,740 per contract. 

So we need between $129,718 and $140,740 to run our portfolio. Let's just weight it at 55/45 for an average:
129718 * .55 + 140,740 * .45 = $134,677.90.

So for $134,677.90 on UPRO and TMF, this is the equivalent futures position:

Long 1 /ES Contract.       
Long 1 /UB Contract.       
$134,677.90 sitting in our futures account.            

Does that seem **excessively** risky to you?  /UB requires $7,150 for overnight margin while /ES requires $12,100 overnight margin at TD Ameritrade. We have 18.8x the overnight margin of our sole /UB contract sitting in the futures account and we have 11x the overnight margin of our sole /ES contract sitting in the futures account. That doesn't seem excessively risky to me.   

All together this position requires $19,250 of overnight margin and we have 7x of the overnight margin sitting in our accounts! [SPAN Margin could make this position require LESS margin too.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spanmargin.asp)  That doesn't seem excessively risky to me.        

# Rethinking Risk Comparing 1.5x Simulated NTSX to 1.5x HFEA to S&P 500
[Jan 1992 - Current Back test of Simulated NTSX, 1.5x HFEA, and the S&P 500](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=4&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=Simulated+NTSX&portfolioName2=Simulated+1.5x+HFEA&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=90&allocation1_2=90&symbol2=VFITX&allocation2_1=60&symbol3=VUSTX&allocation3_2=60&symbol4=CASHX&allocation4_1=-50&allocation4_2=-50)

> CAGR: 10.25%  Stdev: 14.46%  Max Drawdown: -50.97%         

In writing my guide [The Case for NTSX and Chill instead of VTSAX and Rest for FIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/o9proo/the_case_for_ntsx_and_chill_instead_of_vtsax_and/) I realized how close NTSX is to 100% stocks in terms of CAGR, risk, and drawdown. So I decided to do the same benchmarks and throw in 1.5x HFEA.

I now view 3x HFEA as taking the same risk of leveraging 100% stocks to 2x leverage or leveraging NTSX at 2x leverage. I view that as risky as investing in a lifecycle investing strategy. So I'm not being incredibly risky taking 3x leverage when you really think about it - its really applying 2x leverage to similar probability statistics!

With that in mind, I've decided this: **any additional borrowing on this portfolio is irresponsible.**

I've changed my mind. **I won't even think about borrowing a penny on this portfolio.**

I still feel comfortable holding long term before I hit my de-risking strategy milestone. After all, so far with monthly re-setting of leverage [it's been excellent to hold 2x 100% stocks for a long time.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=100000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=4&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=Simulated+NTSX&portfolioName2=VTSMX&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=200&symbol2=CASHX&allocation2_1=-100) You definitely need a point when you stop playing though, of course. That's why I'm significantly de-risking 25-50% of HFEA at what I expect to hit around age 62-65. 

**I don't feel comfortable to retire on HFEA at all.** So far my de-risking strategy remains unchanged. 

# Rising Interest Rates already happened with TMF and TMF survived fine!

One self-proclaimed fixed income trader had this criticism of the portfolio:

>Fixed income guy here, so let's do some basic bond math. Duration is a measure of how much a bond's price changes with respect to changes in yields. If your duration is 10 years, for every 1% (or 100 basis points) that rates increase, the price of your bond will decrease about 10% (yields and prices are inversely related).     
             
> TLT duration right now is 18.84 years. For every 1% rise in rates, TLT will lose 18.4%. Now, you're advocating for owning 135% TMF. So, your duration risk is (3\*1.35\*18.84) or 76.3 years. Your bond portfolio on its own is wiped out if rates rise 1.31% or 131 basis points.

This person totally got the math wrong. The portfolio is advocating owning 135% **of TLT**,  NOT TMF! 

The correct duration math is 1.35\*18.84 = 25.434 years.

You can also calculate the duration math of the 45% TMF component this way: 3\*.45\*18.84 = 25.434 years!

[In 2020 to 2021 the U.S 30-Year Bond Auction rose from 1.330% interest to a high of 2.395% interest, for a 1.065% rise.](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/30-year-bond-auction-572/?catPage=history)

Just take a look at that graph. Did TMF get wiped out like that poster was predicting? [Nope, not really.](https://ycharts.com/companies/TMF/price)

How about this data? [The 30 year treasuries rose from 2.61% from Dec 15, 2008 to 4.65% June 08, 2009.](https://www.macrotrends.net/2521/30-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart) That's a 2.04% gain. Did this portfolio get wiped out? **HELL NO.** [It grew substantially thanks to UPRO!](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2008&firstMonth=1&endYear=2010&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=100000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=3&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=Simulated+UPRO%2FTMF&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1_1=165&symbol2=TLT&allocation2_1=135&symbol3=CASHX&allocation3_1=-200) 

A portfolio with a bond duration of 25.434 years is pretty darn safe!  I'm not worried about a rising interest rate environment. **We can clearly see gaining 2.04% over 6 months did not tank this portfolio!** 

# The Treasury DOES NOT SET the interest rates of their bonds! 

I also want to stress that the 30 year bond rates are **auctioned** in the market. The Feds DO NOT SET the rates of the 30 year bonds! The only interest rates the Feds control directly is the OVERNIGHT rate. [Treasury Direct has an excellent article on how Treasury Auctions work.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/auctfund/work/work.htm)

>When participating in an auction, there are two bidding options - competitive and noncompetitive.
> Competitive bidding is limited to 35% of the offering amount for each bidder, and a bidder specifies the rate, yield, or discount margin that is acceptable.
> Noncompetitive bidding is limited to purchases of $5 million per auction. With a noncompetitive bid, a bidder agrees to accept the rate, yield, or discount margin determined at auction.

>At the close of an auction, Treasury awards all noncompetitive bids that comply with the auction rules and then accepts competitive bids in ascending order of their rate, yield, or discount margin (lowest to highest) until the quantity of awarded bids reaches the offering amount. All bidders will receive the same rate, yield, or discount margin at the highest accepted bid.

The auction is DESIGNED to generate the lowest interest rates as possible. Quite frankly, the Feds **want** low interest rate bonds to continue. Lower interest rates benefit the Feds as the debtors. Lower interest rates make the long duration bonds swing more than at higher interest rates. 

Likewise, since it's the market that determines the interest rate, sometimes it will be higher too. Let's keep hoping the market wants higher interest rates while the economy is going good, we're winning on our equities, and we are getting our stock market crash insurance for really cheap! 

This is why I can sleep soundly at night running this portfolio. I want to keep backing up the truck on these bonds that still today appear to move inversely correlated when the stock market crashes, the overnight rate drops to 0%, and the market rate on these 20+ year treasuries drop to 1% or less from their previous 3-4% issued yields!  


# Lots of people don't understand how bond math works

[The best way to learn is to play with a bond calculator.](https://dqydj.com/bond-pricing-calculator/) Combine it with the [bond auction interest rate data above. I'll be nice and link it again.](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/30-year-bond-auction-572/?catPage=history) 

Now we need some more data on our bond fund. They're owning a lot of different bonds. We need [TLT's weighted average maturity which Fidelity is the first result for that.](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=TLT)

It's 26 years, so that is what most of their bonds are in the fund based on Fidelity's reporting. Now we have all the data to compute the percentage move TLT is expected at the current rates. Subtract 4 years from 2021 and most their bonds right now are bonds from 2017. The auction rate on that is roughly 3% for that year. One bond has par/face value of $1,000. Or you can put in $100,000 if you want, or whatever your actual dollars of bonds you currently own is. It doesn't matter. I'll just stick with $100,000 as the base price. 

Their annual coupon rate from the auction data is 3%. [Right now the market rate is around 1.5% looking at TLT's dividend yield.](https://ycharts.com/companies/TLT/dividend_yield) So enter 1.5 for the market rate. As we already looked up TLT's data, enter 26 years to maturity. US treasuries pay twice a year so leave that as a default.

So now we get a bond price - $132,195.71. If you sell this bond today you realize 32% capital gains from buying it! Now you can see how a 3x leveraged fund can move. If you bought two more of these bonds with a low cost loan, you're now sitting at 3 * 32% capital gains - or 96% before loan interest costs!  

[Now we see why TMF doubles and halves all the time.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=100000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=TMF&allocation1_1=100) 

Look at TMF's prices in 2017. They dropped a lot from the rising rates! They halved from $30 to $18 then trended up $20. Yeah people would have been complaining to buy TMF back then at $18 to $20 and complaining about their losses then. But right now TMF is trading around $25 to $27 a share! I'd be really glad to have a ton of my money I parked at $18-$20 a share in 2017 to be $25-$27 a share right now! 

In Covid TMF shot up to $40-$45 a share. I bet you were really glad to buy a ton of shares at $18-20 for re-balancing! 

Again, **we want interest rates to rise slowly** so we are purchasing higher and higher interest rate bonds that will provide a ton of protection when the next stock market crash happens. Now I'm really glad we purchased those high interest rate bonds in 2017! It paid off handsomely in the Covid stock market crash! 

This is why I'm not afraid of rising interest rates. Again TLT is buying bonds at auction. They got in at 2.32% interest rate despite the market rate being 1.5%! This is one of the advantages of being in a bond fund for a long time! Put in the calculator 2.32% for the coupon rate and 1.5%. Just TLT buying at auction produced a book value of 19% on those bond issues. I <3 bond funds!

# Callable Bonds Revisited

[Interest rate graph of the OVERNIGHT rate 1954-2020, credit Forbes.](https://i.imgur.com/JFVMJcz.jpg)

Ok, now you know how bond math works. Now you know about the auction operations of the US Treasury. Let's combine those two together.

Then, because the Feds AUCTION all their bonds, the long term US treasury rates auction jumped much higher interest rates because the bonds were CALLABLE at the time! At the same time the Feds were messing with the OVERNIGHT rate too! 

I'm going to get really nerdy here and pull up the exact call feature of the 30 year bonds that were sold in auction before 1985. [Treasury Direct has a nice history of how bonds changed over the years.](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/history/histtime/histtime_bonds.htm)

>1974: 25-year area bond issues (callable after 20 years) became a regular feature of mid-quarter Treasury refunding operations.         
>1977: 30-year area bonds (callable after 25 years) became a regular feature of mid-quarter refunding operations, replacing 25-year area bonds.         
>1985:	Noncallable 30-year bonds, which are more attractive for stripping than callable bonds, became a regular feature of mid-quarter refunding operations.         

So it's no wonder WHY this portfolio tanks so fucking hard in the 70s. In all effect these 25 and 30 year issues were treated as a **5 year bond** thanks to the call feature! Since the Treasury were doing MARKET operations the MARKET decided to be like, hey, the best bid on these shit bonds is 6%. The best bid on these shit bonds are 12% and so on. 

They had to bid higher too than the overnight market rate which was likewise jumping around trying to fight inflation! 

The callable bond feature let the treasury FREEZE interest payments PERMANENTLY. Then you had to either mail in your bonds directly to the treasury or take it to a bank where they redeemed it for FACE VALUE. How would you like your $132,195.71 bond to be redeemed for $100,000? You would be fucking pissed! How do investors protect themselves at the time knowing the bonds they were buying have a call feature? They raise the interest rate for the risk that their bonds get called! The feds were a joke this era! 

If you got the 6% 30-year bond then rates rose to 12% - the treasury didn't call them, and you lost a lot of your bond's value!  If you got the 12% bond they'd be called in 5 years if the market rate was 6% at the time instead! **Again, all downside and no upside.** 

We just explored how bond auctions work. If I see the treasury ever re-introduce a call feature on LTTs I'm dumping TMF completely and probably will go to intermediate term treasuries. 

Let's see [how the intermediate term treasuries portfolio does.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=100000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=3&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=HFEA+intermediate+treasuries&portfolioName2=HFEA+LTT+treasuries&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1_1=165&allocation1_2=165&symbol2=IEF&allocation2_1=135&symbol3=CASHX&allocation3_1=-200&allocation3_2=-200&symbol4=TLT&allocation4_2=135)

We're still getting that desired 22% CAGR. Again I'm showing you - MOST THE RETURN is from the equities portion! 

Same exact drawdown in 2008. That was because like Covid both LTTs and the stock market crashed first moving in sync. However look at the worst year. -41.14% (intermediate treasuries) vs -26.21% (LTT treasuries). The intermediate treasuries don't nearly help as much to ballast these stats. 

Just look at the insanity 1970-1984 is. Do you really think we will repeat 20%+ overnight interest rates along with callable bonds? Do you think the Feds would jump interest rates that high with non-callable bonds? My answers to both questions are no. This is why I'm able to sleep soundly at night with this portfolio.

# More data on the Correlation Trading Strategy and why we Rebalance Quarterly

Many people criticized my choices of my dates to re-balance Hedgefundie's portfolio. So I want to provide more data to back up my findings.

[U.S 30-Year Bond Auction Data](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/30-year-bond-auction-572/?catPage=history)

Same link as above, but it needs to be repeated a second time. Go through their slider and look at the history of interest rates. [We can see interest rates rise and fall all the time.](https://i.imgur.com/wchI77W.png) This is the correlation trading strategy action we desire.

Our quarterly re-balancing happens to dodge when the 30 year US treasuries go up for auction by re-balancing on the first trading day of the new month. 

[Now let's go through all of 2020's Earnings Calender.](https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/earnings?day=2020-01-01)

You can see Jan 2nd is very quiet with only 2 companies reporting earnings, same with this week. Next week each day has 8-28 earning reports, next week 42-28, week after we see 75, 95, and 124 on some days, and so on. 

[I'm not going to write out every report so I found a very nice graph for the first ~quarter.](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reports-by-day.png)

You can clearly see a pattern emerging where it's quiet in January, then gets crazy in Feb, and Early March where the graph cuts off. The data still holds for 2020, so I'll spoon-feed the rest of march. The first week is averaging 126 earnings reports per day, 2nd week 127 earnings reports, third week 100 earnings reports, 4th week 100 earnings reports, 5th week slowing down to about 50 earnings reports per day, then first week of April is averaging 25 per day. 

**We are rebalancing each quarter when there are the least number of companies reporting earnings for that week in the US Stock Market!**  

Pick any day of that quiet week to rebalance, it doesn't matter. Hell pick quiet Fridays if you want. 

I'm going to be providing a few daily rolling Sharpe ratio graphs next. [Here is an excellent article on rolling Sharpe graphs.](https://breakingdownfinance.com/finance-topics/performance-measurement/rolling-sharpe-ratio/) 

[Here is a daily(60 days) rolling Sharpe ratio graph from QuantConnect showing 55/45 UPRO/TMF HFEA in action on the actual ETFs themselves re-balancing each quarter.](https://i.imgur.com/6zJNDj8.png) You can see the strategy is spiking to as high of a 2.0 to 4.0 sharpe ratio along each quarter, and dropping off in January sometimes and dropping off a bit on each re-balance period. 

Remember, the Sharpe ratio is independent of leverage, and Hedgefundie's portfolio is adding 3x leverage all the time to the above daily sharpe ratios here in this graph. Yes we do dip below zero at times and do take some losses.

[And here is a daily Rolling Sharpe Ratio Graph for SPY and TLT from 2004 onwards at 55/45 at 3x leverage, with
leverage reset daily and SPY/TLT quarterly re-balanced.](https://i.imgur.com/z02H2Gy.png)

Again we are seeing the same pattern above repeat. Yes it's harder to pick out dates given the huge history 2003-current represents. Yeah 2008-2009 really sucked hard and that is where we have our -65% drawdown. Just like COVID treasuries were delayed for a bit before they rose in response. Their safety did help out the portfolio tremendously. 

I really like how the Sharpe ratio really remains constant throughout the entire history I'm able to back test using Quant Connect. 


Again, the idea of correlation trading strategies are **we are always right** by betting nearly 50-50. This is some substantial evidence that a huge portion of the return of this portfolio is due to this correlation trading strategy. We are basically playing earnings each quarter. 

Then again, I previously shown in comments that [monthly re-balancing is fantastic too.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=600000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=8333&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=2&rebalanceType=4&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=UPRO%2FTMF+Simulated&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=165&symbol2=VUSTX&allocation2_1=135&symbol3=CASHX&allocation3_1=-200) Most the return is from the equities portion but you are getting some substantial juice playing earnings by doing quarterly rebalancing. 

# OMG it could go to zero in a day?!?!

[Again, show me when the S&P 500 dropped 33% in one day.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_S%26P_500_Index)

I've already outlined why it's impossible for the S&P 500 to drop 33% in one day, and you can read the first guide to read my argument again. I even provided a 1987 back test that goes through **THE LARGEST DROP IN THE S&P 500'S HISTORY and it was fine.**

If UPRO does zero in a day then we will have 45% of TMF left parking our cash, which would probably moon or grow more. We're parking our cash every quarter in a pretty stable value ETF given it's 3x levered. We are hopefully growing really fast with UPRO and parking more and more money each year you hold.

Then TLT and TMF's index is the [ICE US Treasury 20+ Year Index.](https://ycharts.com/indices/%5EICEUST20Y) **Show me where it's dropped 33% in one day.** It'd be incredibly unlikely for the worlds SAFEST treasuries to drop 33% in one day! Many nations buy our treasuries! 

Again, the bond duration of this portfolio is 25.434 years of long term US treasuries. 

# Dude you're going to crash/burn/etc in 30, 40, 50+ years 

I found it was really sad that people skipped over my de-risking strategy. My milestones are estimated to be hit roughly every 10 years. Yes I'm all-in now, but there will be a time I'm not all-in in the future. I'm extremely confident this strategy will exist in the next 10 years! 

I suggest you [make an Investment Policy Statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement) for your investment objectives. I updated my IPS when I decided to go All-In with Hedgefundie's portfolio. In essence, my two guides are partly my own IPS as well. 

# If this strategy gets popular will it affect the US Treasuries Market or US Stock Market? 

I don't think so. If you go back to the bond auction link the 30 year sells roughly **$27 billion** 30-year treasuries **per month**.  That's 324 billion per year. For the 20-30 years of bonds we are playing that is an estimated market cap of **$3.240 trillion of US Bonds.**

[TMF's AUM is $280 million.](https://ycharts.com/companies/TMF/total_assets_under_management) Is $280 million going to move the market? Probably not. They're using swaps and futures derivatives. If TMF loses 4% of their NAV($280 million) in one day of trading, $11.2 million is a drop in the bucket for the US treasuries. Again most of their holdings is swaps and the swaps are directly affecting the market. 

Ok, what about leveraged ETFs like UPRO? [Again their AUM is $2.5 billion.](https://ycharts.com/companies/UPRO/total_assets_under_management) That is not going to move the S&P 500 futures market that [trades 1 to 2 million contracts a day.](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/equities/sp/e-mini-sandp500.volume.html) 2 million contracts is $428 billion being traded every single day.

Clearly UPRO isn't going to affect the futures market. Most of UPRO's AUM is with bank swaps then they trade some futures on top of it.  If UPRO loses or gains 4% of their NAV($2.5 billion) in a day and needs to buy/sell shares, that's only $100 million of volume, and most of that volume is their swaps and not futures contracts being traded. 

A good rule of thumb is one person's trades affect the market when they become 5% to 10% of the daily volume. At 5% of the daily futures volume UPRO would need to trade $21.4 billion to start affecting the market **in futures** every day. UPRO on a usual day would need to grow 214x larger. At 10% daily volume UPRO would need to grow 428x larger! Quite frankly with the futures making up a small amount of UPRO, let's estimate 1/3, then UPRO needs to grow 648x larger to have 5% of the S&P 500 futures volume, and 1296x larger to have 10% of the S&P 500 futures problem. 


HFEA can probably scale to the billions range easily. It's buy and hold and the only trading it does is quarterly outside the daily leverage resets. I'm not worried about another SVXY or XIV event. UPRO and TMF are **ETFs** and **NOT ETNs.** XIV died. SVXY continues on. 

SVXY and XIV lost 90%+ as those two ETFs and ETNs were responsible for **shorting 70% of the daily volume** of the VIX futures market. Yes XIV shorted futures too as the ETN provider needs to hedge as people can sell/redeem at any time. It became such a huge crowded trade. Each ETF was designed to short, short, short as much as possible with AUM. Of course a short squeeze happened when the market got shorted so much that the VIX fell to ~9 before shooting up and a short squeeze happened! Just like GME getting naked shorted to death!

A **shorting** ETF on an obscure futures contract is incredibly different to a long 3x leveraged ETF on the largest most liquid stock index in the world! 

Also we can't just look at AUM, we need to look at shares outstanding for your ETF. More shares outstanding = inflows to the ETF. Less shares outstanding = outflows to the ETF.  [Remember ETFs have a redemption and creation mechanism!](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/what-is-the-creationredemption-mechanism) So more shares = more people joining you in your ETF. This is why tiny ETFs are actually so liquid!

[TMF shares outstanding has a ton of inflow and outflow all the time. I don't see anything concerning here.](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/tmf/)

[UPRO has gotten significantly less popular.](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/upro/) They went from 87m shares outstanding to 22.35m shares outstanding [despite splitting so much they're at a x36 multiplier](https://www.splithistory.com/upro/) It looks like the scare tactics of leveraged ETFs are working here! Most people are day trading these and not buying and holding. 

[TQQQ shares outstanding are constant](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/tqqq/) despite many people being in TQQQ it's not a crowded trade at this time either.

So I'm definitely not worried that these leveraged ETFs or Hedgefundie's portfolio is going to become a crowded trade. I had to write two guides on this portfolio, and it's clear most people don't understand leveraged ETFs despite my attempts to help. I'm definitely sleeping soundly at night knowing there are very few people joining me on Hedgefundie's adventure.

Again, to prevent it becoming a crowded trade this is the last time I will write about it on Reddit other than occasionally providing updates. So to the ~10 people that private messaged me worrying I was spilling too much beans on this portfolio you guys and gals can sleep at night soundly. Hopefully we can stay in touch and maybe have a HFEA meetup 10-20 years down the road. 

# Your strategy won't scale/You'll run into liquidity issues

Already covered above. It will scale tremendously. I already know how to make [block trades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_trade) with my broker! See my first guide!  I already own over 10,000 shares of TMF and I'll be excited to get my first creation unit of 50,000 shares! 

[Here is another guide on ETF liquidity.](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-etf-liquidity) Then if you regularly trade 50,000 shares of an illiquid ETF there is more good advice in this article:

>If you trade this size regularly, a good first step is to contact the ETF issuer itself and request the capital markets desk. One of the main goals of the issuer’s capital markets desk is to ensure that investors enter and exit funds at fair prices. They can also be a great help in providing market impact estimations, underlying liquidity analysis and connecting investors to liquidity providers.

# You have significant Bank Counter Party Risk

We already covered TMF's $280m aum and UPRO's $2.5b aum. [Let's look at all the Treasury ETF's AUMs.](https://www.etf.com/channels/ice-us-treasury-20-year-bond-index-etfs)

Let's focus on those shorting this index. We have 2x TBT with $1.49B aum, 1x TBF $619m AUM, 3x TMV at $301m AUM, and 3xTTT at $103M aum. Look at all their charts and performance, they're losing a ton and a ton of money. 

Now we need to look at the longs. TLT is unlevered and directly owns bonds so we can skip them. We only have one other sad long treasury - 2x UBT with $35.76M aum.  Man it's crazy to think about I'd own 0.75% of UBT if I de-levered to the 2x strategy!  I currently own 0.09% of TMF. 

Clearly the banks can match TMF and UBT's long swaps with the swaps of the short bonds. The banks are profiting handsomely right now being long US treasury swaps with all that AUM on the short side.

I'm not concerned with counter party risk for TMF at all. Yes it technically exists as they have swaps but there is so much dollars on the short side that the banks can pair TMF's swap to the shorts and profit off the interest rate spread on both swaps. 

Now time for [Inverse/Short ETFs for the S&P 500](https://www.etf.com/channels/inverse-etfs) 

We have 1x SH at $1.40B, 2x SDS $619.36M, 3x SPXU $520.13m, and that's all as far as I can tell.

Now [let's do long leveraged ETFs.](https://www.etf.com/channels/leveraged-etfs) 

We have 2x SSO at $4.0B, 3x SPXL at $2.39B, 2x SPUU at $26.8m, and of course 3x UPRO at $2.5b. 

So yes, unfortunately there is possible counter party risk with the bank swaps for the leveraged funds. Fortunately that is very easy for the banks to handle - they buy shares of an S&P 500 ETF or the components directly to hedge the swaps. They charge borrow rates in their swaps to do so as well, so they still profit. I'm sure they would love to have more people buy these leveraged ETFs for more swaps and so on! Of course they match the swaps to the short funds side as well, and profit twice. 

[Then you should really review how swap agreements work.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityswap.asp) Yes there is counterparty risk unfortunately, but reviewing how swaps work brings a lot of peace of mind to the portfolio. UPRO is on the hook if the S&P 500 falls for their payments. The bank is on the hook if it's past the libor +markup rate, which the bank gets to subtract the interest from the payment. When the banks buy shares to hedge the swaps they get their money to make up for losses, and they still get their interest rate they want for the cost to buy securities. These swaps turn out to be profit centers for the bank. The bank can also decide to hedge many other ways - they could hedge with futures contracts, call options, etc. 

Yes there is counter party risk, but these ETFs set up swaps with several banks to minimize the risk. I'm able to sleep at night holding these leveraged ETFs. I really don't think they will burn due to counter party risk. 

# But that 0.75% management fee UPRO and TMF are charging - Bogle must be rolling in his grave

[You'll be paying the same 0.75% markup for under a $3 million account at IBKR for the same strategy on Portfolio Margin.](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46376)

Let's look in depth how a leveraged ETF works! [I decided to make a spreadsheet comparing a 3x daily-reset leveraged ETF to do it yourself monthly reset.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVYLmEtnLCVJ-bZvBR22aRauG7arMGS6TXs2-s123gw/edit?usp=sharing) Please COPY the spreadsheet instead of requesting edit access. Please take lots of time and play with variables on this spreadsheet. I won't be spoon feeding every combination of expectations. 

And yes, before anyone comments, this spreadsheet has 0 volatility in it. I'll leave it as homework to try to model volatility. If anyone models volatility as up or down every day though that is a failing grade. The stock market is mostly trending in all of our stock market crashes. Yes there are a few 10% up days in covid, but for the most part it's vastly trending.

Most of the inflated volatility figures comes from the put premium calculations. Big surprise - puts increase premiums in a stock market crash, [those numbers feed the VIX](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/vix/vixwhite.pdf), and now volatility is high. That doesn't mean we are going to start seeing days of washing machine +10% followed by -10% followed by +10% over and over. **That just simply does not happen.**

In UPRO's prospectus they take the expense ratio and management fee daily out of the fund's equity.

You can see how in a trending market that grows 12% annually the leveraged ETF has equity of $140,112 while doing it yourself at IBKR once a month monthly your equity is $138,478.  

**The LETF has 1.18% higher equity**,  and thus has an effective expense ratio of -1.18% given these parameters.

Likewise, in a trending losing market at -12% per year the leveraged ETF is **1.38% higher equity** for being able to de-risk faster than your taxable account!

Despite that Bogle-Rolling-In-The-Grave 0.75% management fee, these leveraged ETFs are an excellent deal! 

Now this spreadsheet shows why re-balancing leverage yourself is a **brainfuck strategy.** Look at 2x on monthly for selling off -12% annually. Each month the market loses you're selling shares to pay down your loan to keep the same leverage ratio! Month 0 you have $100k equity and a $200k loan. At the first of the next month you have $96,750 in equity and you need to sell shares to pay your loan down to $193,500! Second month you're at $93,605 equity and you need to sell your loan down to $187,211, and so on! 

**Do you have the mental fortitude to hit that sell button every month you're losing money?** I don't. That is why I recommend you buy a leveraged ETF instead of investing on margin yourself. 

# If this strategy is so great why aren't any funds doing it?

I was really frustrated to see this comment repeat over and over on my guide. I provided two funds that ARE doing the same or a similar strategy, just at lower leverage ratios:

[2x PSLDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst)

One [popular investment is 1.5x NTSX.](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/efficient-core/ntsx) It is the ONLY leveraged fund allowed over at Vanguard as so far it's beating VTSAX's return with slightly less risk!  NTSX is intermediate treasuries though so it's not quite a direct replacement. 

[Read my just posted guide on NTSX for more info on that fund!](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/o9proo/the_case_for_ntsx_and_chill_instead_of_vtsax_and/) 

[RenTech might be playing HFEA, they just bought $934k of TMF.](https://fintel.io/so/us/tmf) Or maybe it's a sole bored trader running HFEA, lol. Other Hedge funds are long too on TMF.

You can think of Hedgefundie's portfolio as buying 2x of NTSX on margin, or 2x of VTSAX on margin but it's leverage is reset daily and it has a huge LTT treasury bond component as a hedge. That's how I view it, it's risky, but it's not out of the world risky. That is why I have a de-risking strategy and a final portfolio target when I substantially stop playing it.

I hope my additional charts and data helps solidify and explain this awesome trading strategy.

# TL;DR
[**Go HERE to the First Guide if you're NEW to Hedgefundie's portfolio and read IT'S TL;DR**](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/o7tnm5/my_guide_to_hedgefundies_portfolio_and_why_im_100/)

[**Hedgefundie at Bogleheads is the original creator of this portfolio. Read his thread for more data.**](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=272007)

This is the second part to my Guide to Hedgefundie's Portfolio. I ran into Reddit's 40,000 character limit on the first guide. I wanted to respond to various issues raised in comments on the first guide and provide more data to back up my findings. 

**This will be my last guide, post, and comment on Hedgefundie's portfolio** other than providing everyone occasional updates on how being 100% invested in this portfolio is going. 

# Edits
I found an [awesome graph from Forbes showing the Overnight Rate from 1954-2020.](https://i.imgur.com/JFVMJcz.jpg) Deleted 2nd futures section.

Just look at the insanity 1970-1984 is. Do you really think we will repeat 20%+ overnight interest rates along with callable bonds? Do you think the Feds would jump interest rates that high with non-callable bonds? My answers to both questions are no.

2021-06-26,"28M - Just hit a third of a million in Sydney, Australia: Slow and steady","28M - Just hit a third of a million in Sydney, Australia: Slow and steady Hi everyone

I've been a long-term lurker of this subreddit and always enjoyed reading about other people's stories and journeys to get inspiration and lessons from. So I thought I would share my own journey so far. Always keen for advice and suggestions! Let me know if you have any questions or want to know more!

I also thought this might provide a slightly different perspective as a (relatively young) millennial professional working as a lawyer in a high cost of living city in Sydney, Australia taking the *slow and steady* route to FIRE.

No life-changing windfalls from crypro-currency, the share market or property here unfortunately...

# About me

* 28 male, single
* Lawyer
* Living in a HCOL area in Sydney, Australia
* Net worth = $333k AUD (\~250k USD)
* Savings rate = 44% this year

# Slow and steady

If I had to give this chapter of my life a title, it would probably be ""*Slow and steady*"" - looking back, it's been surprising how consistent and steady my net worth has been tracking since starting full-time work despite all the other changes personally and in the world with:

* the pandemic hitting in 2020 - despite the initial drop in the markets and the uncertainty with the lockdowns and working from home, I think I've been lucky so far with work continuing and life in Australia being relatively less affected than other parts of the world;
* I've had modest promotions and pay rises in my role including a change of job - but it appears this has been offset with lifestyle creep and additional expenses like moving out and getting my own place;
* being a late convert to FIRE. I've always lived a reasonably frugal lifestyle with a view to the future and preferred to spend more on experiences rather than chasing fads and material possessions. It was only in 2019 that I discovered that there was a whole community of like-minded people who had a name for this mind-set and a much more developed plan for financial independence! Until then, most of my savings was just sitting in high-interest saving accounts with no clear plan.

# Net worth

Below is a graph that shows how my NW has grown and how my allocation of assets has changed over time. I am still waiting for that exponential growth...

[Graph of Net Worth](https://i.imgur.com/Q7oLT7P.png)

I only started tracking numbers regularly in the second half of 2019 after discovering FIRE but have managed to back-track the previous numbers from looking at my records.

2015 = **-20k** (Finished Uni with a negative net worth due to student loan debt. I did some part-time work over this time at Uni as a tutor and a paralegal which helped.)

2016 = **-6k** (Started my first full-time job as a Graduate Lawyer)

2017 = **30k** (Continued working as a Lawyer with some modest pay rises)

2018 = **80k** (Moved out of the family house and rented my own place)

2019 = **140k** (Changed jobs with a corresponding pay rise)

2020 = **230k** (Weathered through the pandemic and bought my own place)

2021 = **333k** (Hit milestone of a third of a million!)

# Current allocation of assets

Below is a pie chart that shows my current allocation of assets.

[Chart of Current Allocation](https://i.imgur.com/TGwftyB.png)

Bank Account = **3%** (I've kept a few months of living expenses in my bank account as a fund just in case.)

Savings Account = **0%** (With interest rates so low at the moment, I've moved all my money out of my previous high-interest saving accounts.)

Shares = **37%** (I historically hadn't kept too much money in shares as I've been cautious about the historic highs of the market but am looking to put more money into index funds moving forward, having been burned losing a few months' salary with a few speculative plays into tech stocks following the exuberance of Tesla and Gamestop shares recently.

Retirement Account = **18%** (Australia has a compulsory superannuation retirement system where they force employers to put 9.5%, now 10%, of your salary into your retirement account. There are some tax benefits if you choose to voluntarily add more money into your retirement account but I haven't done too much of this as I hope to use any extra money before I turn 65, which is when you get access to your retirement account.)

Property = **42%** (I recently bought my own apartment in Sydney. Sydney property prices are quite high compared to other places in the world so I am still not sure if this was ultimately a good decision, especially with the transaction costs involved. Only time will tell! However, part of the reason was to take advantage of interest rates being at such historical lows.)

# Spending

Below is a pie chat that shows my spending and saving over the course of the last year.

[Chart of Spending](https://i.imgur.com/CvKmhXq.png)

Unfortunately, tax rates in Australia are quite high (the highest tax bracket is 45% tax) so your actual take-home pay ends up being significantly less than your salary.

Savings = **44%** (I suspect this a very average savings rate but the cost of living in Sydney is quite expensive and I do want to enjoy myself with experiences and find a balance!)

Clothing = **1%** (I think I spend quite a low amount on clothing with the occasional purchase for office attire and casual clothes. This past year with working from home has also meant there has been less need!)

Electronics = **2%** (I don't spend too much on electronics and the latest gadgets -  I am still using an old hand-me-down phone!)

Entertainment = **1%** (This past year has meant there has been less opportunity to go out and spend money! It also just so happens that most of my hobbies and interests don't require much money - like playing football, cooking and binging on TV shows.)

Food = **11%** (This is probably an area where I am spending more money than others as I choose to eat out with friends and family or choose to spend a bit more for groceries. But I don't think I regret it!)

Housing = **34%** (Rent and property prices in Sydney are relatively high. A one bedroom apartment in my current area is $500-600 per week or 380-450 USD per week or 1.65k-1.95k USD per month. But that's just what I have to deal with having grown up and with my job in Sydney. They say that you are under 'housing stress' if you are spending more than a third of your income on housing...)

Life Admin = **7%** (This category comprises various things like bills, medical insurance and other personal expenses. Most of these are inevitable.)

Transport = **0%** (Transport costs for this year were significantly reduced with travel restricted and working from home for much of the year. I don't expect this to be repeated moving forward.)

# Next steps

Overall, I think I am tracking well and am trying to find a good balance between enjoying myself in the present, taking advantage of opportunities, and setting myself up for the future.

At my current rate, calculators say that I will reach FIRE and $1 million in \~11 years at the age of \~40, but part of me does want to enjoy the luxury of having a nicer home and looking after my current (and potential future) family.

So it may just be that this point ends up being delayed further and further to the future!

Keen to hear people's thoughts and advice and if you want to hear more.

My goals for the next year are to:

* **Invest more into stocks and in particular Vanguard index funds** \- I've always been conservative and part of me is still concerned about the current state of the stock market but part of me is also concerned that I will miss out on the next few years if it continues to rise. Having been burnt by some speculative plays into tech stocks, I think I've also learnt my lesson trying to follow the success stories of others in gambling their life savings into stocks like Tesla and Gamestop.
* **Maintain a balance between living in the present and saving for the future** \- I am conscious that my current savings rate of 44% is pretty average but I don't think there are too many other places to cut down without a significant impact on my lifestyle. Food (especially eating out) is probably one area that could be cut down but I am not sure if the additional savings would be worth it for the time spent with family and friends.
* **Find more like-minded people with FIRE in mind to share and learn from!**",0.0,Neutral,English

It is a super aggressive portfolio consisting of two 3x leveraged funds: 55% UPRO and 45% TMF.  It is a 165% equities portfolio and 135% 20+ year long-term US treasuries portfolio that are both mild leverage on their own, but when combined, produces explosive results:

Today I wanted to write an in depth guide to exploring this portfolio in full and why I'm aggressively all-in invested in this portfolio for Fat Fire. I've been getting a lot of questions about this portfolio so I thought I'd put together all my thoughts and insights on it! 

Let's jump right in to leverage! 

# People Misunderstand Leveraged Investing Strategies 

Let's visit someone who blew up an account - [Market Timer over at Bogleheads.](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5934)

Market Timer was following a popular Yale paper at the time - Mortgage your Retirement and the later book [Lifecycle Investing.](https://smile.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Investing-Audacious-Performance-Retirement/dp/B005X4I7ZI) The premise of Lifecycle investing is you start off with an aggressive 200% equities allocation while you're young. Essentially instead of saving $10,000 per year, if you invest with 2x leverage it's like you're saving $20,000 a year. You're borrowing time from the future and smoothing out sequence of risk returns. If the market tanks 50% in one year, an young investor can withstand a $5,000 50% loss. An older investor near retirement with $2 million can't withstand a $1 million loss. 

Eventually with Lifecycle Investing you'll reach a point where you start to de-risk your leverage ratio essentially borrowing a ""constant"" portfolio of your expected retirement each year. Then as you get closer to retirement you glidepath into an 80/20 or 75/25 bond allocation. On average the Lifecycle Strategy historically gets you to retirement 10 years faster at a 15-25% savings rate than traditional retirement would in 100% stocks. 

The key thing Market Timer missed is the paper calls for **monthly reset** of the 2x leverage. If you monthly reset SPY [you would not have been margin called in 2008.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=4&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1_1=200&symbol2=CASHX&allocation2_1=-100)


It's incredibly hard to do monthly reset of leverage intuitively, but it is critical to do so if you're following this paper. It is literally buying more stocks when the price of stocks is high, and selling your stocks to pay down your margin loan when stocks crash. It is a brainfuck strategy.

Let's say you have $100k you want to put at 2x leverage. That means you're buying an additional $100k of stocks on margin. So you now have a $200k position with a $100k margin loan backing it. If you sell this position you're left with $100k, your equity. So your leverage ratio is $200k position / $100k equity = 2x leverage.

Now, what happens if stocks double from here? What is your new leverage? 

Your position is now $400k, you still have $100k of a margin loan, and your equity is $300k. Your leverage is now $400k/$300k = 1.33x leverage ratio. You now absolutely have to buy more stocks at the top of the market to maintain your desired 2x leverage ratio. 

Ok, now let's do the other case, what if stocks drop 25% instead? (50% will result in a margin call).  What is your new leverage if stocks drop 25%? 

Your $200k position is now $150k, you still have a $100k margin loan, and your equity is $50k. Your leverage ratio greatly increased! It's now $150k position / $50k equity = 3x. You better sell down some shares with the market being in the bottom as now you're way more risky than 2x leverage. Further percentage losses will be even worse.

On Reg-T your maintenance margin is 25% equity. You're currently at 33% equity - 50k equity/150k position. TD Ameritrade's house maintenance margin is 30%. **You're 3% away from getting a margin call to wire in funds or sell down your position.**  IBKR is getting ready to auto liquidate you at their maintenance margin! 

So as you can see a trading strategy on margin you literally buy high and sell low. It's very hard for people to do in practice.

# Enter Leveraged ETFs

Since managing leverage yourself is a brainfuck calculation, instead it's better to invest with a leveraged fund like 2x for SSO, or 3x - UPRO. This is why UPRO and SSO daily reset their leverage! It's providing you the most safety and the most return!

In my code with quantconnect daily reset = monthly reset. There is no additional volatility decay from daily reset. You're going to have the same volatility decay even if you manage monthly reset of leverage on your own. 

UPRO/TMF has a 0.75% management fee and with $2.2 billion of AUM they're getting **institutional** borrow rates. IBKR marks up their margin interest rates by 75 basis points. In my code on quantconnect.com UPRO and TMF are identical to SPY and TLT on portfolio margin after adjusting for actual margin interest paid. Unfortunately portfolio visualizer's CASHX variable does no margin markup so SPY and TLT look misleading compared to UPRO and TMF. 

You're getting an excellent deal for the leverage UPRO and SSO provide. You can run these funds in a cash account, in retirement accounts, and so on. I'm running Hedgefundie's portfolio in all my accounts - taxable, Roth IRA, pre-tax solo 401k (rolling 100% over to the roth ira in the 22% marginal bracket), and a HSA account.

# People Misunderstand Leveraged ETFs

[Volatility decay is a myth.](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php) This article explains it a lot better than I can. You can buy and hold leveraged ETFs for long term! 

I just showed you how leverage works. The market is a lot more trending/momentum based over a period of 10-20 trading days. You're not going to see a daily gain of 10% followed by a loss of 10% each and every day. Yes the Leverage ETF prospectuses is scary with math of the VIX being 75+ for an **entire year** of having substantial losses but they're writing it as if **every day** in the market followed the same gain 10% and lose 10%. In COVID the VIX spiked to 85 then quickly normalized to 25.

This last back test is why I'm 100% invested in this portfolio. I could *possibly* achieve $1.3 billion dollars nominally. I have a chance to hit that figure at age 62 if history repeats itself. 

Yes its $555 million inflation adjusted to 1987 dollars, and that $62m of the S&P 500 is $25m in 1987 dollars. And yes, past performance is no predictor of future returns. 

CASHX is modeling actual interest rates. It's the 1-month Treasury Bills from 1972+. No 0.75% markup though which IBKR and UPRO/TMF have.

# Why does Hedgefundie's Portfolio make so much money?

It's due to several factors. Currently the [efficient frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier) of these two asset classes is 55% stocks and 45% bonds. The unlevered portfolio has about a 8% return and a 15% drawdown during 2008. The 2x leveraged portfolio has a 16% return and 30% drawdown, and 3x roughly 24% return for a 60% drawdown risk. 

100% stocks has 50% drawdown risk, which was my previous portfolio. I'm comfortable with 10% more drawdown risk.

Second, because we are adding leverage, we are still maintaining the [tangency portfolio but getting more return for the same amount of risk vs 100% stocks.](https://i1.wp.com/earlyretirementnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beat-the-market-Chart03.png?resize=863%2C627&ssl=1) Credit goes to Early Retirement Now for this graph. With the 3x leverage we're going past 100% stocks and our risk is 27% standard deviation along that same tangency line. 

Many people try to get more return by mixing in riskier assets like Venture Capital, international funds, and so on. Instead Hedgefundie's Portfolio is Modern Portfolio Theory taken to the extreme.  

We are getting more return from having a large insurance component being heavily weighted to bonds. They saved the portfolio a lot in 2008 and in 2020 during Covid. Another quite surprising fact is we are actually profitable on this insurance too. 

Finally, Hedgefundie's portfolio deploys a well oiled correlation trading strategy that produces a crap ton of extra yield via quarterly rebalancing vs annual or monthly rebalancing. The rebalancing period is correlated to when earnings reports are minimal in the stock market. Essentially each quarter you're making a 55/45 bet on the market having great earnings or disappointing earnings. 

# How correlation trading strategies work

Let's say we have two assets that are **perfectly inverse correlated.** Let's say asset A has a 50/50 chance of either doubling or losing 50%, and asset B likewise has the opposite chance?  Can you think of any trading strategy to take advantage of these facts?

Let's say we have $100k to invest with. One strategy is to throw 50% on A and 50% on B - $50k each. After some point in time let's say A doubles to $100k. B will halve to $25k. Now our portfolio is valued at $125k - a 25% gain! So now we rebalance both to $75k A and B.

Now, what happens if we add leverage to this trade?

So instead of taking $100k to invest with, we borrow an additional $100k with our equity. We now have $100k on A and $100k on B. After one year we have $200k on A, and $50k on B. We have a $250k position and owe $100k. Subtract $100k and our equity is $150k. 

Since our equity is $150k we now have a 50% gain. The 2x leverage doubled our return.

Bringing this back to Hedgefundie's portfolio it's a well oiled correlation trading strategy machine with a ton of leverage. Now you see why that 55/45 bet every quarter is paying off! It doesn't matter if earnings are bad or good, **we still profit.**  We do expect more good earnings it being the stock market and growth, so that's why we're weighting our bets a bit for the optimal growth. ;) 

# 40+ year bond bull market - aren't you worried about rising interest rates?

No, I am not. Most the return comes from the 165% equities, with TMF acting in the nick of time for crash insurance. [If we plot out simulated UPRO and TMF you see simulated TMF doubles then draws down 50% all the freaking time.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=4&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=Simulated+100%25+UPRO&portfolioName2=Simulated+100%25+TMF&symbol1=SPY&allocation1_1=300&symbol2=TLT&allocation2_2=300&symbol3=CASHX&allocation3_1=-200&allocation3_2=-200)  We see UPRO trending. Again, we are seeing the correlation trading strategy I just discussed about in action!


Then for rising interest rates, bond funds operate differently than an individual bond does! That is because bond funds have [convexity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp). TLT happens to sell the 20 year bond to buy the 30 year bond at auction! So if interest rates raise slowly, say no more than 0.25% - 0.50% per quarter, then soon you'll start profiting with the higher interest rate! 

Then there are many strategies that you actually want to go LONG on 20+ year treasuries in a rising interest rate environment, such as the [Barbell Strategy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbell_strategy)

> In finance, a barbell strategy is formed when a trader invests in long- and short-duration bonds, but does not invest in intermediate-duration bonds. This strategy is useful when interest rates are rising; as the short term maturities are rolled over they receive a higher interest rate, raising the value

Right now TMF is mooning as thanks to the Feds statements there are less inflation fear in the 20+ year treasury market. So now yields are dropping which causes bonds to rise. The yield curve is flattening as bond investors are trying to get the risk free rate regardless of the duration of the bonds due to the positive outlook.

If TMF keeps it up it will be the first time I'll have to sell TMF to buy some UPRO! I got really tired of having to buy TMF all throughout Covid. I'm sitting on some nice gains having to buy TMF at $22! It's about time to back up the truck a bit on more UPRO shares! 

Many people in the Hegdefundie Bogleheads thread also simulated random 1-6% randomly rising interest rates using a monte carlo situation and the portfolio holds just fine under those conditions. 

If you look closely at the backtests the last ten years have been the highest gains vs earlier on in 1987. We're investing in these bonds not for their income but for their capital gains. A 30 year bond dropping from 10% to 9% is not going to produce much capital gains. A 30 year bond dropping from 2% to 1% is going to have tremendous capital gains. 

Again the purpose of these bonds are stock-market crash insurance. Most of our return is coming from the 165% equities position. The future predicted low interest rate environment is very favorable for the bond component of this portfolio. Again, this portfolio makes great use of a correlation trading strategy so we **want** interest rates to raise and fall and have it be **inversely correlated** with the stock market! We want to keep those low interest rates! Let's keep that money printing machine going! 

# Why I'm not worried about another 1970-1980 stagflation era

This is the worst drawdown period for Hedgefundie's portfolio. It has a 75% drawdown over this decade. I completely discount this era due to one critical reason: [US Treasuries were CALLABLE until 1985!](https://www.sapling.com/7796395/treasury-bonds-callable)  No one in the right mind would be running a leveraged treasury portfolio in 1970!

Callable bonds are bonds that can be called at face value at any time! Let's say the treasury issued bonds at 12% in one year then the next year rates dropped to 6%. The treasury's call feature let them stop interest payments and they were called at face value. 

So you have large NAV losses when interest rates rise, and you don't get any upside when interest rates drop! 

Now, just because historically these treasuries had a call feature doesn't mean that the US treasury exercised it. So I went to my local library and viewed old WSJ articles from the 70s on microfiche. Sure enough there are huge lists of US treasuries that got called every single month in these articles! It would not make any logical sense to run a leveraged bond portfolio in this era! 

This entire portfolio is a play that US treasuries are no longer callable and I would stop trading this portfolio if they ever become callable again in the future. It's also a play on the current Fed policy remaining the same - doing quantitative easing and dropping interest rates in future stock market crashes just like they did for 2008 and Covid! 

# TMF is a Yield-Curve Play on Long Term 20+Year US Treasuries

Right now the 20+ year US treasury is trading at 1.5%. TMF is borrowing on total-return swaps with the overnight rate effectively 0%, with 80% of the fund being TLT itself. You're getting 1.5% * 3x leverage = 4.5% of interest on TMF before lending expenses. After TMF's 0.75% management fee it's a 3.75% APR return. If you're 55%/45% then this portfolio is getting 1.68% APR in a low-volatility sideways market. Since TMF is borrowing on total-return swaps the dividend gets paid into the fund and the NAV grows! 

Again, yes TMF is taking a 0.75% management fee, and doing the same trade with IBKR on portfolio margin you're paying a 0.75% markup on the overnight rate if you want to buy TLT directly. 

Again, we are using TMF for protection and insurance, but it's nice to have something that's profitable vs buying puts, calls on the VIX, going long on VIX futures or VIX ETFs. I'm very happy to keep holding TMF throughout post covid. 

# Taxable account performance

With my code using www.quantconnect.com and calculating all the PnL on the quarterly trades, then computing actual LTCG and STCG taxes on these trades, the federal tax drag is 1.5% for an account at my current level for the historical last 10 years. For a $10+ million account it's 2.0%. Living in California adds another 1.0% state tax drag.  So if you're getting 24% CAGR in a tax-advantage account you're getting a 22% CAGR in taxable for federal tax drag (21% in California).

In my original simulations when I started this portfolio I paid $300k in federal taxes for 10 years with UPRO/TMF, and I paid $600k in taxes over 10 years with SPY and TLT on portfolio margin. Buying 2x dividends really sucks.

UPRO and TMF are excellent tax dodges as the vast majority of their return is total-return swaps with the banks. So instead of realizing dividends, the swap pays those dividends into the fund as part of the total return index and the NAV of the fund grows! So when you sell UPRO and TMF you realize your dividends then! 

It turns out if your hold period is less than 30 years with a 2% federal tax drag, you're best in a Roth IRA, followed by Taxable, followed by pre-tax 401k. After 30 years the order is: Roth IRA, Pre-Tax 401k, Taxable. It turns out paying 40% in ordinary income taxes in the pre-tax case is worse before 30 years, but after 30 years it has a higher after-tax value thanks to dodging the tax drag.  

UPRO and TMF holds about 80% unrealized gains across my simulations, and mostly throw off LTCG gains when major re-balances happen too. You'll want to use specific identification to sell shares that have the lowest possible tax cost. 

# Tax Loss Harvesting

Tax loss harvest pairs:            
UPRO -> SPXL      
TMF -> TLT Synthetic Stock on Reg-T/ 3x TLT shares if on PM                      

You can also take advantage of tax loss harvesting which I did not write code to evaluate for. URPO's tax loss harvest pair is SPXL, another 3x ETF. So my 2% federal tax drag is a **worst case estimate.**

TMF has no other 3x 20+ year treasury ETF, so it's tax loss harvest pair is [Synthetic Long Stock](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/synthetic-long-stock.aspx) on **TLT** at 3x delta. So if you have a $45,000 position in TMF and want to harvest all losses in your $45,000 position, and TLT is trading at $143.64, then this is the formula:

3 * (45,000 / 143.64) =  939 delta of synthetic stock on TLT.

So you will buy 9 ATM call options and sell 9 ATM naked puts on TLT for 31+ days to keep your position, then you will want to close the synthetic stock and rebuy TMF with the left over cash.  Again using quantconnect.com this is the most accurate model I can get to TMF. It turns out bond futures are a terrible replacement for TMF and it brings me to the next topic.

I personally did the synthetic stock trade to tax loss harvest TMF in February 2021 and I was able to buy back the same number of shares of TMF. It works wonderfully.   

If you're on Portfolio Margin just save your time and commissions and buy 939 shares of TLT. [Use Box Spreads to Refinance your margin](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fegqz0/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) instead of paying your broker's usury margin rates unless you're on IBKR. 

# Futures suck for Hedgefundie's portfolio

In a taxable account futures are **marked to market.** You realize your PNL every year as of Dec 31st. In my above simulations /ES and /UB futures costed me $2.8 million in federal taxes. Talk about an insane tax drag!

Futures are only worthwhile in a retirement account, which brings us to the next problem. There are no micro futures for /UB and /ZB. Each /UB future is currently $180k notional value. You need a $1-$2 million+ retirement account to get fine grained leverage on these futures, otherwise your leverage will swing from 2x to 4-6x depending on if you round nearest or round down your number of contracts! 

Finally, I cannot get any mix of /UB and /ZB to replicate TMF's fund testing with quantconnect. Convexity strikes again! It turns out reviewing the actual deliverable of these future contracts its a basket of bonds that is EITHER the 25 year or the 30 year bond. So you're only trading one bond! The future traders will deliver the 25 year bond as it's the cheapest to deliver if interest rates are below 6%. They will deliver the 30 year bond if interest rates are above 6%!  Only if interest rates are **exactly** 6% are any of the 25-30 year bonds deliverable! 

So the bond futures are less than ideal for leverage with this portfolio. They either add too much risk or not have enough risk. /ES futures track UPRO very accurately though. 

# Won't you have Liquidity Problems on your trades?

No I won't. ETFs have [authorized participants](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedparticipant.asp) that help with liquidity in ETFs. Also ETFs are required to post their [indicative Net Asset Value (iNAV) every 15 seconds.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indicative_net_asset_value.asp) You can look to see what the quotes are vs the most current iNAV.

In February I decided to tax loss harvest TMF and I sold down my entire position slowly at a time as level two quotes were showing 700 shares offered. I was a bit fearful as I know TMF is a bit illiquid at $200m AUM and I had a huge position. I switched to synthetic stock on TLT.

Then I wanted to test the reality of buying back all my shares, which I had $132,000 remaining in cash at the time in my taxable account. At $22 a share it'd be my biggest trade - 6,000 shares. I was sweating bullets. I still only had quotes of 700 shares on L2 quotes. I was about to buy 6,000 shares all at once with a marketable limit order of $0.01 spread on TOS over TMF's iNAV. TMF had a $0.01 premium - works for me! I'm doing it for science. I had coded an entire algorithm at Quant Connect to sell TMF and UPRO randomly in 200-700 round lots using IBKR's API instead if this portfolio got so huge out of the concern of the L2 quotes I was seeing.

For the next 30 seconds TOS played sound after sound of order filling. I filled my entire limit order, then the spread widened to $0.05-$0.10 for the next 30 seconds after I was filled, then it narrowed back down to $0.01 and TMF was $0.10 higher iNAV wise. I had an instant profit of $600 on my position. Soon the iNAV went back down to what it was before my trade. I had discovered a lot more people in the order book than those 700 shares!

Finally, if you do have a large enough position you need to re-balance from that an Authorized Participant will take - the process is simple. [Make a phone call to your brokerage's block trading desk and they'll help you out.](https://www.tdainstitutional.com/offerings/investing-wealth-management/trading-services/block-desk.html)

TDA Ameritrade and Fidelity both offer block trades for free to high net worth clients! Both TDA and Fidelity Block Desks can place trades with the authorized participants so I will definitely get NAV of TMF when my account grows this large! 

# Tail Risks

People point out if **BOTH** stocks and bonds go down 33% **in one day**, this portfolio would go to $0. Quite honestly it'd take an irresponsible Fed to raise interest rates so high that it'd piss off the entire market to sell off like this in one day. I don't think that will ever happen. I would not be 100% invested if I thought this was at all a realistic scenario. 

Then yes, UPRO can, and has gotten near to 0% (historically simulated UPRO had a 98% drawdown in this portfolio!) but we're hoping TMF will moon hard to save the portfolio instead. 

Then right now with the [S&P 500 circuit breakers](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp) it's impossible for UPRO to go to $0 in a day, although the drawdown will be gnarly.  UPRO has roughly 220% of swaps and the rest are S&P 500 futures. So even if the swaps can't be adjusted this day UPRO can probably unload enough futures on the market to cover in a drawdown.

This is also why I'm staying the hell away from TQQQ. Normal QQQ had an 80% drawdown in the 1999 tech stock crash. Granted, all these tech companies are a lot more mature on the NASDAQ, but I personally have no interest in tilting or having an allocation to TQQQ. 

# My De-Risking Strategy 

I have a de-risking strategy that helps me sleep at night. I will be selling a portion of my portfolio to invest in 100% VTSAX (or the 2x spy/tlt leverage version) at every milestone I hope to achieve:

* $12.5m - $25m NW - I'll be selling $2.5m to lock in a FIRE lifestyle.      
* $110m NW - I'll be selling an additional $7.5m to lock in a $10M Fat Fire lifestyle       
* $1.1 billion NW - I'll be selling an additional $90 million to lock in a rich $100m Whale Fire lifestyle      
* $4 billion - $10 billion - $20 billion NW - I'll be selling 25-50% of my portfolio to go into wealth preservation, lock in billionaire status and let the rest ride.       

I'm projecting each milestone is 10 years of my life. Selling 10% over 10 years is roughly a 1% unlevered allocation.

I may transfer the amount I de-risk into an asset protection trust so I'd feel comfortable if I want to borrow on this portfolio in the future.

# Securities Lending for Hedgefundie's Portfolio

I've decided that any additional borrowing on this portfolio is too risky. I had a whole section here calculating the margin math based on it's previously max historical drawdown. IBKR currently only requires 30% initial margin on 55% UPRO 45% TMF when you use Portfolio Margin.  

When I wrote my guide on NTSX and [when I wrote part 2 of this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/oaiw3h/part_2_of_my_guide_to_hedgefundies_portfolio_for/) I realized NTSX (1.5x 60/40 bonds - 90/60 with leverage) and 1.5x Hedgefundie's portfolio is very close in stats to 100% stocks in their stats. Therefore, borrowing on this portfolio is equivalent to taking out cash while having a 200% stocks position or buying more NTSX on margin! 

Would you withdraw cash while being leveraged 2x on 100% stocks? I wouldn't. So I've changed my mind and **any additional borrowing on this portfolio is irresponsible.**

# Are you worried about the strategy if leveraged ETFs are shut down?

No I'm not. The SEC made a final decision in October 2020 to keep leveraged ETFs. They're limited to borrowing 2x directly with margin but can go up to 4x with derivatives. 3x UPRO and TMF are safe. 

If they ever go away then I'll be running this portfolio using SPY and TLT on portfolio margin in a taxable account.

# Aren't you too optimistic?

Why yes, yes I am. However I'm 28 years old with $600k riding on this portfolio with an excellent track record that since 1987 goes to $1.3 billion in nominal dollars. It's my only shot in the world to be a billionaire in nominal dollars and I'm taking it. :)

# Is this portfolio right for me?

Ultimately it comes down to your willingness and ability to take risks. It may not be right for you. **Even Hedgefundie is only risking $100k on this for a good chance of it turning into $10 million over 20 years.** 

I'm following a lifecycle investing philosophy of investing while young. My financial situation is very unique. 

You need to have the balls to sell TMF for UPRO in a stock market crash even if UPRO has drawdown 85% or more. In 2008 UPRO had a 85%-90% drawdown for the 60% of the portfolio's drawdown. If UPRO repeats its historical 98% simulated drawdown you need to be backing up the truck with TMF and buying those shares on a fire sale! 

You absolutely need to be mechanical about rebalancing every quarter and not have any second thoughts about doing so. 

Feel free to invest at a lower leverage too. You can do 2x with SSO and UBT. Or 2x with [PSLDX](https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/mutual-funds/stocksplus-long-duration-fund/inst)

Or you can drop down to 1.5x. One [popular investment is NTSX.](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/efficient-core/ntsx) It is the ONLY leveraged fund allowed over at Vanguard as so far it's beating VTSTAX's return with a lot lower risk! NTSX is intermediate treasuries though so it's not quite a direct replacement. 

Finally, [good old 1.0x leverage does pretty well.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1_1=55&symbol2=TLT&allocation2_1=45)

You can also use Hedgefundie's portfolio strategically. For instance, start a Coverdell ESA account for someone who's a baby and [by the time they're age 18 it's grown to $875k.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=2000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=2000&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=3&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1_1=165&symbol2=TLT&allocation2_1=135&symbol3=CASHX&allocation3_1=-200) It's quite impressive for investing $2k a year! You just gifted $875k from $2k of annual gifting - excellent for estate tax purposes! 

You can get around the income limits by making contributions from a trust or corporation: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc310

> Organizations, such as corporations and trusts can also contribute regardless of their adjusted gross income.

My sister just had a child.  I started a Coverdell ESA account for her child at TD Ameritrade. They allow UPRO and TMF and individual stocks to be invested for benefit of the child. Yup it's 100% invested in 55% UPRO and 45% TMF. 

Ultimately you don't have to be 100% in this portfolio and many people aren't. It's incredible how much growth just $2k a year turns it into if you hold it for long enough. 

# Useful tools

I made [a spreadsheet you can use that pulls in quotes from Google Finance to easily re-balance this portfolio.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GzOp0mTp6AYr_arvPHlAb1bJR_6WUjFCdbuSGpaZNCM/edit?usp=sharing) Please make a COPY and don't request edit access. 

It tells you how many shares you need to buy and sell. It also supports tax efficient cash rebalancing too. I personally invest in it's current allocation but doing simulations on both it doesn't matter much in the long run. It also tells you how many shares of SPXL to sell if you tax loss harvest this portfolio. 

Then it also tells you your percentage ownership of the two ETFs. I may have to file 13Gs/13Ds in the future for this portfolio. You can see how a $3m portfolio is already owning 0.63% of TMF.

# TL;DR
[Link to Part 2 of this guide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/oaiw3h/part_2_of_my_guide_to_hedgefundies_portfolio_for/)

I'm 100% invested in this:

[1987 - Current 165% VFINX 135% VUSTX UPRO TMF Simulated](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=600000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=8333&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=2&rebalanceType=3&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=UPRO%2FTMF+Simulated&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=165&symbol2=VUSTX&allocation2_1=135&symbol3=CASHX&allocation3_1=-200)

For this return:

> UPRO/TMF Simulated	$600,000 -> $1,354,019,830       
> Vanguard 500 Index Investor	$600,000 ->	$62,417,951

If you're young enough that a 100% equity portfolio doesn't give you enough risk, you can lever up to increase returns without dipping into alternative/speculative assets such as venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, and so on.

2021-06-16,Joining a tech company without coding / a small novel on the tech industry,"Joining a tech company without coding / a small novel on the tech industry I think the principles of FIRE are broadly useful to just about all people:

""It is not the man with too little property, but the one who wants more, who is a pauper."" - Seneca

Build a lifestyle that makes you content, build your income until your means exceed the needs of that lifestyle, and invest the difference into your future.

But can we talk for a minute about the second part - building your income? It's important because there's a hard minimum that anyone needs to spend in order to be content. There's often far more flexibility on the earning-side than on the spending-side, but none of us has perfect information and so none of us knows all the potential opportunities available to us.

Since I've been working in tech - mostly big tech, currently FAAMG - for my entire adult life, I know a little about the opportunities in this industry. I've noticed a tendency here for us engineers to humble-brag about, essentially, FIRE on easy mode. I've also noticed a tendency for people here outside the industry to disbelieve income claims, or to assume that one must be an elite computer scientist to make $150k, or a C-suite executive in a HCOL area to make $300k. I'd like to share an insider's view of the tech industry and some of the coding and non-coding opportunities it provides.

There are four broad types of tech employment:

1. FAAMG: the largest 5 tech companies by market cap, that have invented money-printing machines (Facebook: ads, Apple: hardware, Amazon: cloud infrastructure, Microsoft: cloud infrastructure, Google: ads), and rely on many tens of thousands of tech workers to keep their machines operating better than any competitors'.
2. the rest of Big Tech: Netflix, Salesforce, Adobe, Twitter, Dropbox, Uber, several others. Similar to FAAMG, but slightly smaller market cap.
3. Startups: Smaller, venture-funded companies trying to join the ranks of FAAMG & co.
4. Everything else: Every company now depends on technology to a larger degree than most people realize. Huge corporate budgets go to their tech organizations, which to them are cost centers: if they could lay off all the tech staff and still accomplish their business goals, they would. Agencies and consulting companies exist in this space as well.

The compensation structures in tech are bifurcated into extremely high comp (Big tech, funded startups) and everything else. Let's get ""everything else"" out of the way first: the average software engineer makes a little over $100k in the US, mostly in salary. That accounts for a huge number of software engineers because there are software engineers in *every* company now.

However, a junior engineer straight out of school can expect to make $175k total comp in big tech. The floor for high-comp employers is often the ceiling for everyone else.

Now, to understand comp structure. FAAMG leads the way with a standard package that's usually composed of: Salary + 15% of your salary as an almost-guaranteed bonus + Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) that vest over usually 4 years. In FAAMG, the RSUs are usually more than half of your total comp. The rest of big tech follows in the same league but usually 10-20% lower overall, with similar salary levels and fewer RSUs. Startups imitate FAAMG, using venture capital to offer lower salary balanced by larger private stock or options. They do this because it hedges their risk - if the startup takes off, they can afford your massive payday, and if it fails, then those private RSUs or options are worthless anyway.

In big tech & deeply-funded startups, it's possible, but slightly rare, for a software engineer to exceed $500k / year. This would almost never be salary (with the weird exception of Netflix). Instead, it would usually be something like $200k salary + $30k bonus + $1.2 million RSUs vesting over four years. Generally, those RSUs would not all be granted at the same time - instead, they would have been granted over several years working at the place, a couple hundred thousand at a time during your re-up period, usually on an annual cycle in lockstep with performance reviews.

Lots of factors contribute to and detract from this total comp. I'm sure it happens, but I have yet to see more than $500k total comp for a remote role in a MCOL or lower city. Usually San Francisco, Seattle, NYC, and a few other places get a ""premium"" status from the compensation team and everything else is some lower percentage of that maximum band. A very senior engineer (7-equivalent at Google or FB) in a HCOL area can break $750k / year, the lucky bastards. Aside: at that point, you're firmly in golden handcuffs and most non-top-tier companies can't afford you; if you don't like your job, it must really suck, because your rational brain says you absolutely must not quit, even if your daily life is miserable. We see some of the impact of that on this subreddit.

Now, how can you capitalize on this for FIRE, without being a software engineer?

Big tech companies are huge, employing hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom are not engineers and do not write code. Startups are smaller, but there are tons of them (300 in the latest YCombinator batch alone), and together they also employ a ton of people - some of whom do not write code. All of these companies pride themselves on hiring ""the best"" - across the technical and non-technical board - and their salary bands are anchored high because of all the engineers on staff. Some caveats:

- Usually, these companies aren't as remote-flexible for non-technical roles. You will have better chances if you relocate to SF, Seattle, NYC, Houston, Austin, Denver...
- Usually, these companies don't offer large non-salary comp to non-technical roles (until you reach a certain level of seniority).
- Big tech seems to like to hire from other tech companies. So a viable strategy can be getting your foot in the door in a smaller space (like a startup) and then leveraging that into interviews with top-tier companies.

So, here are some six-figure roles in big tech companies that don't require any coding:

- content managers (use a CMS to update marketing websites)
- email marketers (use a CMS to write marketing emails)
- marketing coordinators (handle swag, sponsor conferences, coordinate speakers/promotions)
- sales (manage relationships, pursue leads)
- product managers (gather customer and industry data, feedback, build requirements, work with engineering teams to launch products)
- office managers (manage a bunch of the complexities of these huge tech campuses)
- UX / UI designers (work with product managers & engineers to design product workflows, interfaces, and branding)
- HR / ""People"" teams (develop the processes a company uses for people management - reviews, performance, hiring/firing, coaching, etc)
- recruiting (source & hire everyone else, usually targeted to hard-to-hire areas like technical engineering managers)
- finance: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/o1f12s/joining_a_tech_company_without_coding_a_small/h20qmld/
- customer success (this one is iffy on my six-figure claims. It happens, but usually with more technical products where you have to be technical to support the customers.)

If you can see yourself in one of those, then you may have the option of making FIRE easier by starting a code-free big tech career.

**My Thoughts:**

It doesn't do things like Monte Carlo simulations or comparing asset allocation scenarios. The reason I keep coming back for more is how it visualizes an entire life's financial events and trajectories. Initially, the amount of data entry required to even _see_ a projection almost made me close the tab and move on. Glad I stuck it out long enough to see the interesting results.

The main graph can render four different perspectives in ""Whole Life"" mode, all of which include pre _and_ post retirement projections alongside financial life events. The [""Yearly Cash Flow""](https://i.imgur.com/e8NwAE6.png) ^(sample data screenshot) and [""Stacked Financial Breakdown""](https://i.imgur.com/ZN581ty.png) ^(sample data screenshot) views were the most helpful to me and my monkey brain. They clued me into a couple ways to optimize my plans.

**Privacy and Cost:**

Given that it's mostly free, it was a massive surprise to see that it doesn't send your data anywhere. The only network requests that go out after the page loads are to get icons and other visual assets (as of 6/7/21 when I wrote this).

It's refreshing to see user data being handled respectfully. It even works offline as long as the initial page load is finished. The ""premium"" option says it includes some kind of backup/saving of your data, but I haven't tried it.

2021-06-09,[32m/32f] My wife and I cross the 1.6M NW a couple weeks ago! Our journey,"[32m/32f] My wife and I cross the 1.6M NW a couple weeks ago! Our journey The TLDR is that my wife and I both work really hard, made smart decisions to change our careers that paid off, and have been good about living below our means the whole time. We don't expect our good fortune to last more than a few years - so we're saving aggressively now.

I come from a pretty modest background. I grew up in the midwest suburbs. Neither of my parents went to college and my mom stayed home to raise kids. Luckily my parents were pretty frugal, and I think this taught me a lot about saving early. Wife has a similar upbringing. We both attended college.

5 years ago, we decided we needed to change our careers in order to secure our financial futures. We didn't go back to school — we just self-studied on nights and weekends for about a year before we made the jump. I wanted to write this post to let others know about our journey and let them know that you can have a modest upbringing and a modest education and still do well.

**Net Worth:** 1.3m + 300k home equity

**FIRE** **Goal**:

* The goal is honestly pretty fuzzy at this point. I know FI is a major priority. We're shooting for financial independence by 40 spending \~$85k a year. The RE part isn't really the goal. We both like what we do and want to keep doing it — but we want the freedom to choose when and where we do it. When we hit our FI goal, we might not RE, or we might take a couple years off or go to part time. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
* 5M in invested assets would feel really, really comfortable, and we're hoping to hit that before 40yo

**Income**:

* **Total Comp** = \~500-550k

**My Salary History (as best I can remember) I'm not including my equity here, just base salary.**

* 2010: $30k — College job
* 2011: $32k — First ""real job"". Graduated with student debt
* 2012: $44k — Moved
* 2013: $54k — Promotion / Role change
* 2014: $56k — Cost of living bump
* 2015: $60k — Got a raise
* 2015: $60k —  Changed careers. Took the same pay, knowing I was underpaid
* 2016: $115k — New job. Negotiated what I was worth and then some
* 2017: $135k — New job again
* 2017: $140k — Performance based raises
* 2018: $160k — Performance based raise and promotion
* 2019: $190k — Performance based raise and promotion
* 2020: $196k  — Performance based raise
* 2021: $230k — Promotion

**My advice:**

* We chose to pay off my student debt early. In the end I don't think this was necessary but it took a mental burden off of us and gave us the confidence to start aggressively saving early.
* Don’t try to game the system. Aim for stuff you can sock tons of money into that still feels comparatively low risk. We put everything in blends. We're not trying to get rich quick on $TSLA or YOLO calls.
* Don’t overdo it with planning. We don’t keep a budget. We eat out. We take vacations and buy stuff when we want to. This helps us stay motivated to stay in stressful, demanding jobs that have high compensation.
* Don’t buy stuff you don’t need though. We have one car that we’ve had for 10 years. We bought it used. We intend to keep sharing one car as long as possible and only buying a new car every \~15 years.
* Maximizing our income was FAR more important than maximizing savings. This one seems self evident but I don't think anyone really told me how important it was. We were always aggressive savers, but aggressively saving in 2015 just wasn't nearly the same thing as aggressively saving in 2020. Actively trying to get a promotion made all the difference in the world.

&#x200B;

* **EDIT**: to give this some more context on the last point  re: maximizing our income — this means that we both aggressively, consistently pursued promotions in our jobs in order to increase our income. That’s where the bulk of our efforts went. It’s okay to change jobs a lot if it helps you get to your goal TC and it's okay to leave a good job for another one with higher comp. Being loyal to one company is only worth it if you see a clear and significant path to growth. Some folks have this POV that you need to “do your time” in a career or at a specific company, but I don’t believe it’s a good idea. I was comfortable changing companies every year if it wasn’t panning out. That being said I never just quit a job because I wasn’t making enough. Always look for your next opportunity while you are still employed (if possible of course) even if it’s vastly more difficult.
* I fully recognize I could only prioritize doing this because I had other things working out for me. Having paid off student debt, no car loan, no kids, good health, and renting a cheap apartment made our monthly expenses lower and helped us build a safety net, which allowed us to be riskier in our careers in a way many others cannot. 
* For us this also meant almost always taking promotions we didn’t feel ready for. It’s exhausting and terrifying  and the feeling of imposter syndrome never, ever goes away. But what is helpful to remember even if you feel overwhelmed by it, others have already carefully considered that you are the best person for the job. It doesn’t mean it won’t take work for you to do it well — but it means they believe you have the skill and aptitude to be successful.  Believe them.
* Examples from my own path - I moved for a new job because the career prospects in that city where more promising than where I was. That jump was significant. 2013-2015 was about clearing out debt. Before changing careers, we really debating if just moving to another city where we could make more money without fully making a jump to a new field would be enough. Then, I mentioned that the first job I had after changing careers was way below market rate. I could have stayed to gain more skills - but I was already looking for a new job just a couple months after joining. Once I had an offer in hand (even though I didn’t have any competing offers) I negotiated up. Later, working extra hours to do more projects at work that could align me well for promotions have been what I’ve focused on. Continual self-study in the evenings has been something that has stuck with us throughout the years and helped us continually be better",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-06-06,(36) Got a late start in life at 30 and more recently found FIRE. My backstory & journey so far to $1 million,"(36) Got a late start in life at 30 and more recently found FIRE. My backstory & journey so far to $1 million Hi everyone - I’m not to my FIRE number because of cost of living but well on my way now. This subreddit along with a couple others over the last year have been an amazing help! Single, 36, HCOL area (Seattle/Bellevue). Neither of my parents were very financially savvy or really instilled that in me. In my preteen days I grew up lower class, going to the food bank with my mom regularly to eat and we lived in an extended families basement. Later went to live with my dad and his new wife and was more lower-middle class. 

I got a “late start” in life by graduating with my Bachelors and getting my career/corporate job going at the age of 30. Worked retail for 10+ years before that and was more focused on living in the moment until I was in car accident at 24 that made me re-think what I was doing. Socializing, partying, drugs (not hardcore), spending what I made (which wasn’t much) and saving just a little to a basic savings account. I was on disability from work for ~1 year and physical/occupational therapy for ~2 until I started my program at 26. My outlook changed drastically and I really wanted more out of life and to create goals and have ambitions.

By crazy advice from a friend, I took the majority of money I had saved in my bank account (almost $10k) and put it into Amazon stock during my 1st year of school. I ended up getting a full scholarship during my 1st year as well but continued working my retail job to pay for living and avoid taking loans.

Got a paid internship my senior year making more than my retail job which was awesome. $20 an hour! Secured another internship for the 2nd part of the year making similar. This company offered me a full time job at the end just months before graduation. Started at $48k + $5k bonus. After graduating and working almost 1 year, I was tired of commuting from Federal Way to Seattle/Bellevue. I also noticed the housing market was really picking up and read how that was a great investment vehicle. 

End of 2015, I cashed out my Amazon stock which provided me a down payment on my 1st condo thanks to it growing 500%+ over those years. Turned initial $10k life savings into ~$50k over that time. Still not that much money to my name at the ripe age of 30 compared to many but it’s about choices continuing I feel. Purchased that in downtown Bellevue and from then to now the property has doubled in value and less than 10 years left to be paid off. I was promoted 2x within the initial 3 years at my 1st company which helped me to save more and push money to my 401k which I had never had. As of early 2021 I’m maxing out my 401k and since starting an IRA in 2020 I’ve maxed that out each year as well. I don’t make insane money at all, but 6 figures with dedicated and mindful saving as well as house hacking as noted below.

In 2018 I had saved up enough and did a little more investing in single tech stocks to purchase a bigger home in Bellevue. Ended up getting a new construction townhome during the time of bidding frenzies in late 2018. From then to now the property has gone up in value 40%+ and that’s being conservative based on my neighbor that just sold. Moved to another company beginning of 2019 and took a 80% increase in pay from my last position which has really put me in a better spot to keep saving. I don’t work in big tech and am not a software engineer :) I have been renting out my downtown condo since purchasing my townhome and plan to keep that until at least 2023. It is located 2 blocks from an incoming light rail station at that time as well as a 1 million square foot Amazon building one block away full of tech workers that will highly likely increase costs in the area.

As of late 2019 since not being in a relationship I have rented out 2 of the bedrooms in my townhome which has been great as a temporary extra couple $thousand per month in income to save/apply toward mortgage.

2021-06-02,10 years after graduating. ~$775K NW. Military.,"10 years after graduating. ~$775K NW. Military. I recently turned 34, am single, do not have any kids, and serve in the US military. While I consider myself financially responsible since an early age, I did not discover FIRE until COVID began. I didn't get serious with FIRE until 2020. Now that I am serious, I am leaning hard into the lifestyle. I have changed MANY of my bad splurging habits and investing significantly more. 

I started my career debt-free because the military paid for my associates when I was enlisted, paid for my bachelors to commission, and recently just paid for my masters as a full-time student. This helped catapult me into a saving/investing which was exacerbated by a $11k inheritance at 18 years old. Yea, totally a trust-fund baby :) jk (RIP Grammy). But seriously, it helped a lot. I am and have always been an index fund investor with a few individual stocks (currently 10).

90% of my money is parked between S&P, Nasdaq, and small-cap funds. I also do not believe in debt, so all major purchases besides my home was with cash (credit card; then paid off EOM). My emergency fund was always a few months salary.

Current breakdown:

* TSP: $204K (S&P/small-cap)
* Roth: $160K (S&P/Nasdaq/small-cap))
* Taxable brokerage: $407K (S&P/Nasdaq/10 recovery stocks)
* Checking: $25k (emergency fund)
* Yearly salary: $135K | Yearly expenses: $48k.

For starters - at 18 when I inherited that $11k -- I invested it all into APPL, MSFT, HD, and MO (important later). I opened a brokerage account at the direction and help of my father. He was a major influence in my financial behavior from a young age. I invested in what I knew and after that I did not really invest any money until I graduated with my bachelors about 6 years later. I was young and either deploying \[then blowing my money when I got home\], or just enjoying the college experience. Honestly, I would not change anything because I was losing friends left and right during that period and that set a tone for me for the rest of my life. I wanted to find a happy medium between saving/investing and living. One thing I am constantly reminded of in my career is -- the only thing guaranteed in life, is death. I think the FIRE community often overlooks this. Just to be clear, I have never lived paycheck-to-paycheck, always kept an emergency fund and never dipped into that.

2011-2015: Ok, so I graduated undergrad and got serious. I was making $65k-$85k during my early years. Deployments always skew results because of tax-free money. Also, since a portion of military pay is not taxed, we ""make more"" or so it feels. My mentality once I graduated was to max my TSP (401k) and Roth. I stuck to this. Remember how I said I wanted a happy medium? Well, my thought process was max both vehicles and spend the rest - toys, travel, experiences. I did just that. Do I regret it now? No. I knew what I was doing. Could I have invested more? Yes. Oh well, I digress. Furthermore, since my account met the threshold, I hired a broker to manage my money - another mistake I do not recommend. The USAA broker sucked and their mutual funds generally sucked. It was a waste of money. Also, took me two years of investing into my TSP to realize that the money was just going into a bond fund. I switched the allocation to the S&P fund immediately. OUCH!

2016-2020: Sticking true to my happy medium, I continued to max my TSP and Roth -- and spend the rest. I bought my first home in 2016 (basically zero money down because VA loan) and had grand plans to rent it when I moved duty stations. I also fired my broker in 2017 and took over. I liquidated everything in my Roth and moved it to S&P and Nasdaq funds. My salary continued to increase as well so that meant more spending. Ok, I do regret some of my excess spending these years - primarily the sports car. I was making $85k-$115k during this timeframe. I made a fatal mistake during 2017-2018. I sold most of my APPL, MSFT, HD, MO. Yup - BIG MISTAKE. Do not do it. I sold stocks to take a profit and purchase that car with cash. I also rotated some of the money into some other tech stocks. I discovered FIRE during 2020 as well which made me constantly look back at this and get mad.  I bought as much as I could afford during the COVID dip. Buffet engrained in me that the market was on sale so I took his advice.

2021: Not only discovered FIRE, but discovered Reddit and actively listen. Thank you! My salary increased now to $135k. I sold my car that I purchased in 2018 because of the used car market and I had my fun with it. It's also important to note that I always lease my daily driver because I deploy a lot and am able to break the lease no questions asked. Ok, so technically I am carrying some debt here but it seems to be more efficient than letting a car sit and depreciate. I am basically renting a new car to drive for 12-18 months. Never put any money down, though. Also, decided to take advantage of my primary home and sell it during this market since I had to move to a place I can only rent at. House value doubled in five years. I plan to buy a multi-family home at my next duty station and hack it. Unless I settle down. Then I'll have to buy a SFH with my VA loan and then buy a duplex with a conventional loan. A boy can dream!

In sum - Avoid bad debt. Save/invest early and often. Find a balance between health, wealth, and happiness. Buy and hold. More specifically, never sell an asset just to purchase a liability. If you cannot save for it and budget, you don't deserve it (blunt). Buy more when the market corrects/dips. Do not hire a broker. Invest in index funds that match the market. Make sure your 401k etc. is not being invested into a bonds/MMA. Be proactive with it. Spread financial literacy wherever possible.

2021-05-28,FOUR YEARS into early retirement from retail pharmacy,"FOUR YEARS into early retirement from retail pharmacy **FINANCES**: I’m going to phone it in this year with the update. Check prior contributions to see more history if you don’t know what this is about. Spending “budget” was $43,866 (based on 2% of net worth at EOY 2020). Actual spending was $47,384 but with $11,133 passive income (stimulus checks and ebay sales), withdrawal was only $36,251. Our estimated net worth went from $1,333,772 (year zero) to $1,471,164 (year one) to $1,488,092 (year two) to $2,010,995 (year three) to $2,534,758 (current). Huge bump in year three was from being pre-gifted an inheritance worth $200k. Huge bump in year four was from the massive explosion in local real estate prices and strong stock performance – both are up 30% this year. I’m basically 50/50 in VTSAX and real estate at the moment. I plan to make some moves into bonds and commodities to help mitigate asteroid risk.

**YEAR FOUR**: I stayed at home a lot over the past year due to the pandemic and followed politics closely. Wife and I have been volunteering with the Cornell University nest watch and bird feeder watch programs. I got back into running but not racing (except helping to pace friends on their own races). I do about 90 miles per week @ 7:15/mi, staying tired but pain free. I cycled for a little bit but grew tired of it. I spend more time with my wife just sitting and talking on the porch while we watch the birds. Most of my non-fiction reading has been on natural selection (Darwin, Dawkins, Coyne, Gould, etc.) and quantum mechanics (Susskind, Friedman, Feynman, Einstein, etc.) My fiction reading has been heavy on classic sci-fi (Asimov, Verne, Herbert, Heinlein, etc.) I’ve spent a lot of time collecting vintage Nintendo stuff, especially Nintendo Power magazines (I’m searching for my last one – the newsstand variant of issue 152 if you have it!). As for gaming, Diablo II, Persona 5 Strikers, and Ghost of Tsushima took most of my time. I watched the new Cosmos season and re-watched the Marx Brothers filmography recently. I made my first ever trip to the ER due to a kidney stone (thought I was dying). Our dog had to be put down. She was the closest thing I’ll ever have to a child.

**YEAR FIVE**: I want to do less internet. I still want to learn to swim and move to triathlon. I want to volunteer more, listen to my multi-channel hi-res audio more, and make better use of my Criterion Channel subscription. We’re definitely making up for lost traveling. Second trip to Hawaii combined with third trip to Japan should be as soon as Japan will let us in. I’ll be picking up a Ford Transit Connect XL van (or something similar) soon for some cross-country driving, including a long-delayed three week trip thru California. I’d like to pick up some more acreage further out in the middle of nowhere and build an off-the-grid cabin with solar because the noise is starting to pick up with everyone moving to Middle TN. Just something simple to have as a getaway. I also see heavier philanthropy in the future if the market wants to stay this irrational. And yes, whatever the fuck I want. Ha ha.

2021-05-21,One more 1M+ $ guy from Europe :),"One more 1M+ $ guy from Europe :) Hi redditors,

Most of the people in this subreddit are form US: CA or NY, so i think it would be of interest to see how it can be done on another side of the ocean and in less paying places.

I'm 32, single, and just broke 1M$ level, so here is my story how i did it.

I graduated in Russia as a scientist (nuclear physicist) ten years ago in 2011 and after that went  for PhD in Germany.

After the mortgage crisis in 2008, the prices of the real estate in Germany were also quite dumped as in US, so I sold my apartment in Russia and bought one in Germany. Prices and currency in Russia were quite high at that time, due to oil-driven EM bubble.  The apartment was the initial bootstrap from my parents (love you, mam) and it was 4000k rubles(100k $).

In following years, the ECB's QE interest rate policy has driven the real estate prices 3-4x times up in Europe, so my apartment is now worth 260k euros (317k $)

During my PhD studies I had a scholarship 20k euros (24k $) annually post tax, living in own flat i.e. not paying any rent and saving aggressively. In my PhD years I realized that I want to achieve FIRE, so I could do my cosmic particles research and not be bothered by expenses of this ""mortal world"". Young scientists are usually stuck for ages in the short term ""postdoc"" contracts that pay almost nothing. Obviously one can not break into FI with such a shitty cashflow.

That's why I pivoted myself into quantitative finance and in 2015 got a job in IB as a quant. Started at 55k euros (66k $) and grew into 80k (97k $).  Also in 2016 I have opened brokerage account and poured into it all my cash savings at that time (70k$). Bought an index ETF and some tech stocks like NVIDIA, cuz I knew that GPUs gonna rock, since in a science we used them for a long time for massive scientific calculations.

In the end of 2019 I decided to re-enter russian RE market since after the huge collapse in 2014 it started to recover from dirt cheap prices. My idea was that eventually the russian central bank will do the similar thing like QE as the bigger brothers did a decade ago. And it did so - interest rates have fallen from 15% in 2014 to mere 4.25% in 2021. So in 2019 I got lucky, a few month before Coronacrisis, I exited stocks and rotated into russian RE. I know I missed the ""V"" rebound in stocks, but RE also showed a massive 70% uptick.

Also bought two BTCs in 2017 at 5k and sold a month ago at 57k.

So now German apartment (317k$), a house (215k$) and other apartments (378k + 75k + 75k)  are together 1M+

So i guess the lesson from this story is - QEs are your friends, try to get them as much possible in different places, they are some times not quite synced so there is an arbitrage :)",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-05-15,FIRE and self-actualization,"FIRE and self-actualization I want to touch on something and I'd like to hear how you guys feel about it.
I think a major reason for the work-based culture is people having a need to do something meaningful in their life and to feel fulfilled. The catch is - I also feel like people are on some sense 'tricked' into thinking they have to dedicate their life to a meaningful career, which leaves a lot of people feeling lost or as if something is wrong with them in case they can't achieve it or don't even want to.

This kind of resonates to me with the idea of FIRE. It seems very appealing and its definitely something I am gravitating towards since discovering this idea. I don't want to always be busy, and I like having a lot of free time even just to be lazy.

Despite that, sometimes there is a creeping feeling of ""am I just taking the easy way out"" or ""will I regret not pursuing a long and meaningful career"".

I think this comes from me battling with identifying which parts of my goals are really mine and which I adopted due to expectations. I realized what a lot of people consider normal life is not stuff I actually want, and I'm trying to find what I genuinely want to do in life.

For context ill point out that I'm in a super early stage in my career, started 2 years ago in FAANG and about to finish my degree this year. Thinking of semi-FIRE after a couple of years and see if I can switch to a more chill part time or freelance work (altho this seems very hard to pull off).",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-05-06,Could you be looking to FIRE because you are a workaholic? Take this test to find out!,"Could you be looking to FIRE because you are a workaholic? Take this test to find out! I was listening to the radio and there was a discussion about workaholics, and the discussion reminded me a lot of the discussions on this forum. The segment also referred to a ""Work Addiction Risk Test"" (WART) which can help you identify if you have a work addiction. I took [this test](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2011/05/living/workaholic.test/index.html) and scored 62. The results break down as follows:

* If you scored between 67 to 100 points, you are considered highly workaholic. This could mean you are headed toward burnout, and new research suggests that family members may be experiencing emotional repercussions as well.
* If you scored between 57 to 66 points, you are considered mildly workaholic. In short, there is hope. With acceptance and modifications, you and your loved ones can prevent negative lasting effects.
* If you scored in the lowest range, between 25 to 56 points, you are not considered a workaholic. You are probably a hard worker instead of a workaholic. You needn't worry that your work style will negatively affect yourself or others.

It was eye opening for me to learn that I have mild work addiction, and I'm definitely going to make some changes and see if that changes my outlook on the RE aspects of FIRE. Additionally, I am in a job where work addiction seems to be prevalent and we are seeing an impact on staff turnover. Senior leadership is noticing the impact so I hope they take this seriously... But regardless of what they do, I am definitely going to make some personal changes starting with no checking emails & iPhone after I sign off for the day.

If you take the test, please share your score and let me know if work addiction has played into your FIRE goals -- and what, if anything, you plan to do about it.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-04-25,The principles work.,"The principles work. I frequent reddit as a lurker more than a poster. I had forgotten about a post I made in regard to my financial situation upon graduating from PA school 7 years ago.

Reading it was weird, as I actually put in to play the things I said I wanted to do and I have completely changed my approach to money, versus how I was prior to graduation. Long story short, I was graduating with roughly $150k in student loan debt and if I remember correctly close to $20k on a used luxury car.

The short version is... I have successfully brought my personal net worth from -$170k to now $500k in 7 years, roughly a $670k net gain. My income began at near $100k and never exceeded $135k. I live in a medium COL area. I used basic principles and no fancy investing.

\-I was able to secure three jobs out of school and for the first two years sometimes worked every single day of the month, without a day off. I did this to purchase my first home (a small townhouse) and catch myself up on bills and savings.

\-I sold the luxury car and bought a base model Honda Accord.

\-I maxed my retirement accounts. I only recently began an after tax account.

\-I kept my first home when I bought my current primary residence with my now wife. My mother lives in my first home and pays the bills. It does not cash flow, but I gain equity and a write off, more importantly she has a secure place to live.

\-I cut all my bills to as low as possible. We currently have a cheap cell phone plan and internet only. Our monthly cost is less than $90. We use old phones that are paid for.

\-I refinanced my student loans 3 times to get to an eventual rate of 2.4%. I aggressively paid them down despite the low interest rate, as I was looking for lifestyle freedom more than total returns. I am aware keeping the loans and investing the money would of netted me more in the last few years.

\-I utilized every credit card bonus I could. I would use 0% interest credit cards as ""short term loans"" and use them for all my purchases, while paying down against my debt with my cash. I would then take another out when one was close to being over with the 0% period and pay the original off. This saved me small amounts of money, but built a credit score that hovers in the low 800's.

\-I invest in broad based index funds in all my accounts.

Everything was very basic. I lived well below my means, I maxed out tax advantaged investment vehicles and paid off my debt. We have been fortunate enough that through doing all this my wife can be a SAHM to our 1 year old and we do not have to stress about money. I have also been able to leave my original job and take a job much closer to home, with shorter hours, even though it pays less. I am not FI at this point, however we were able to create a debt free situation that allows one of us to stay at home and raise our child and the other to take a pay cut for better hours/commute with more time at home.

I can say that I learned the majority of these concepts through MMM and financial posts on Reddit. I am appreciative and wanted to give back a success story on how much the basics work if you just stick it out.

TL;DR Living below your means, paying off your debt and investing in index funds pays off.

&#x200B;

Edit: I rarely post on social media and am surprised at such a response. I mainly posted this to show that nothing fancy needs to be done to still have some financial success. No GME, no day trading, etc. To clarify a few things:

Salary- It is higher than average which allows a higher savings rate. I get that. I do agree it would of been harder on a lower salary. I think its clear that higher salary leads to more money to invest, which leads to higher net worth. That being said, in the north east, I feel like there are many people at or near 100k salaries. I have 3 friends who make over $100k who are not in health care. One has a bachelors degree in engineering, one went to one of those automotive schools advertised on TV and is a mechanic, and one dropped out of college and worked his way up at Walmart. You can make money without an advanced degree. All of these individuals have net worths near or above mine, as they have been working longer and did not have the opportunity cost of many years of college plus high tuition. 

Breakdown of net worth- I have $360k in investments/cash and $140k in home equity between 2 homes. My wife's finances are separate. We have a combined net worth of $750k.  

401k- I received a 5-6% match depending on the year, likely contributing $45k + in just base investment to my 401k. Unsure what that has added with returns. 

I do realize I have been fortunate to have invested and purchased real estate during a time of economic growth. Regardless, the principles don't change. Live below your means, take advantage of tax advantaged accounts, pay off debt and invest. I feel like whether it's Dave Ramsey, MMM, ChooseFI, The Money Guy (my current favorite), that it is all the same core message.

***Q1/2021 thoughts:*** 

* Where do I start?... It has been a wild few months...

**Stocks:** 

* I followed the plan to put ⅓ of monthly savings in a Renewable Energy  ETF and also put some minor spare money in AMD and Nvidia, as well as a new tech position: Corsair. *It all dumped hard in the tech correction, lol*. But not all is lost, for the tech stocks I have no worries that they will recover and continue growth since the tech market is absolutely mad right now and no change for the next months is to be expected.
 
* On renewable, well, how do I say this, I actually had only a minor loss here, because I sold a big portion of this position (thus locking in most of the profit around the top) to play the GME hype. I know, WTF stupid idea. I won't bother you with the GME Story, in the end I got out on time & came out with a minimal profit of 1 k€, plus overall it saved me another 2k€ (form the ICLN drop) since I sold before the crash. One lucky shot there. 
* Besides Corsair, I added 1 non-tech stock to my PF which is actually developing great, I will talk about it in my Q2 report after seeing how it developed further.  

**Crypto:** 

* Holy molly, crypto has exploded massively in the last 3 months! My BTC & ETH speculation paid off in a big way, and I am now in the process of DCA-ing out of my crypto positions into my Stock PF. I already locked in around 10k€, with more to come over the next few weeks. The major bonus here is that it is all tax free, since you don't pay taxes on Crypto in Germany, if you have holded the coins more than a year before selling, which is true for me. I made a plan for the DCA-ing out and am currently sticking to it, it's really a nice feeling seeing this speculation paying off finally now. 
* I have added one shitcoin to my Crypto PF with a few k€, where I hope that it will multiply by 2-5x in the future thus netting me a fine payday. This is a pure gamble which I don't think has more than 30%-40% of success. If I lose it, no biggy. 
* On the state of crypto: Hype is high, but I think there is still room for more since I am not yet seeing major retail hype, which is my final personal “sell off” sign. 
* Crypto in itself has not changed a little bit, still riddled with scams and no real use case. BTC (& ETH too), lol, don't even think about moving it to another wallet cause the transaction fees are atrocious. I prepared months ago and moved ⅓ of my position to an exchange to be ready when I want to sell. 
* Currently the Crypto space narrative is “this time it's different”.... Well, we all know how this ends usually.
 
**Cash/EF/Travel money**

* Minor change (-1k€), nothing to worry about. EF serving its purpose. 

**Metals:**

* No change
 

**Final thoughts:**

I keep index investing at least ½  of my monthly SR, the rest is going in ICLN and the stocks I hold. Crypto is still crypto, a huge boost currently which I hope goes on a few months more. As you can see, I am still playing it aggressively, yet this is with old holdings of mine, and I am pivoting it to a standard Index ETF over time to lock the profits, for now its a good tactic but I am now actively reducing the exposure of the PF to crypto.

2021-04-20,Debt-Free Millionaire at 31: The Dumb Way,"Debt-Free Millionaire at 31: The Dumb Way 2 years ago I [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b33onf/i_made_150000_on_the_side_last_year_should_i_quit/) looking for advice on whether I should quit my day job and go full time in my side business or stick it out at the day job for as long as possible.

Ultimately I decided to stay at my day job and continue to work my side business in my spare time.

This week I hit the long awaited 7-figure net worth, becoming a debt-free “millionaire”.

Here’s my story along with lessons learned along the way.

**Current $1M Net Worth:**

65% Investments (retirement + taxable)

30% Property (includes house & car)

5% Cash

**Backstory:**

I grew up in a lower middle-class family and lived in trailers most of my childhood. My mom was a single parent to 3 kids at one point, and we always lived paycheck to paycheck.

I was 14 the first time I lived in an actual house when my family was forced to move in with my mom’s new boyfriend because our trailer got repossessed.

The financial struggles I witnessed as a child definitely shaped the way I view money and debt as an adult, for better or worse.

After high school I was so worried about debt that I attended the most affordable community college for my Associate’s. This was the only big thing my mom & step dad paid for ($10k) but I also benefited from them by living at home during those years.

Around the time I finished my Associate’s I took out a car loan for a used Pontiac and took out a student loan to finish my Bachelor’s online. These loans totaled around $17k.

**Career & Income:**

I landed a part-time job at 19 in my career field that paid $16/hour. It absolutely killed me to have debt so I furiously paid my two loans off as quickly as possible after getting my job.

My annual salary was less than $30k during my first 5 years. Entering my 6th year I became full-time which slightly increased my income.

With my relatively low income from my day job I had a burning desire to earn more money so I spent most of my spare time learning about online business, cameras, and videography/editing.

I spent my life savings on a refurbished MacBook to start learning Final Cut Pro. I had to split the transaction across my debit & credit card just to afford the laptop.

I began posting videos online then eventually used my video skills to film weddings so for the past 7 years I’ve been working three jobs: full-time IT job, part-time YouTube, and part-time videography.

**Estimated Gross Income:**

2013: $42k

2014: $73k

2015: $118k

2016: $140k

2017: $135k

2018: $223k

2019: $237k

2020: $251k

**Savings & Investments**

Luckily my day job came with pension and 401k. I started out by automatically contributing 5% to 401k.

Once my self employment income started increasing my CPA suggested I start a SEP IRA which I did 5 years ago.

Not too long after that I started maxing out my 401k at my day job. It was around that same time when I started investing into a taxable brokerage account (mostly boring index funds)

Unfortunately all those years before that I was just saving cash because I didn’t know about investing and was scared to invest.

I used the excuse of “saving for a house” which most of us are told to do by our parents and grandparents.

I missed out on a TON of market gains by not investing sooner than I did.

But in a way I don’t regret the path I took because I was able to meet my wife during that time, and we bought our starter home and paid it off in less than a year.

Looking back it was pretty dumb to pay off the house that quickly when you consider the low interest rate + the stock market performance, but hindsight is always 20/20. Plus I was completely unprepared to be a long term investor (something that the pandemic market crash has turned me into a believer)

Becoming (and staying) completely debt-free is a psychological thing to me. I always wanted to own my home so I could quit my day job anytime if I wanted to and be able to sleep at night knowing I didn’t owe anything to anyone.

I also splurged and paid cash for my dream car which was probably another mistake on paper, but I also looked at it as an investment of sorts and do plan to keep it 10+ years.

Again, being debt-free is probably an irrational ""mindset"" that is burned into my brain from my childhood.

**Looking Ahead:**

Currently my wife and I are debt-free with 7-figures net worth. She quit her day job last year and is working from home as a part time freelancer. We have no kids but plan to try this year.

I plan to keep this setup as long as possible and maximize my income and retirement accounts. I hope to FIRE before 40 with $2M NW.

My next big goal is to be debt-free with $1M invested. I’m aiming to hit that within 2 years.

I feel like being debt-free (including house) with $1M invested is the ultimate life changer for anyone looking to FIRE. I can’t wait to see what that feels like.

**Lessons Learned:**

The basics of becoming a millionaire are simple, but not easy:

1. Maximize income
2. Minimize expenses
3. Invest the difference
4. Wait

Building a side business has been the absolute best thing I’ve ever done to increase my net worth.

Don’t try to be a millionaire overnight. Be consistent. Find your strengths and build a valuable skillset to see if there are viable business opportunities that can benefit from them.

My “success” so far has been a result of these practical steps

* Craft a set of valuable skills
* Work hard in your spare time to create extra income
* Save as much income as possible before spending
* Invest early & regularly

Not having kids has been one of the advantages for me to work so much in my spare time. But that doesn’t mean it’s the “right” way.

A part of me is actually envious of people who had kids earlier in their 20’s because they are still young and have more energy as the kids get older, compared to someone in their 30’s or 40’s.

Also, not rushing into marriage was something that I take for granted. I waited patiently and met my wife in my mid 20’s. Waiting for the right partner makes a huge impact on your NW and FIRE journey.

The reason I work so hard is so I can reach financial independence as soon as possible and quit working at any minute. The irony is that I don’t think I’ll ever stop “working”.

I tried to explain to my wife that Financial Independence is when you can choose to never work again, while you live off of your assets, but it doesn’t mean you HAVE to stop working. It’s more about the FREEDOM to do whatever you want with your time. I don’t want to wait until I’m 60 to have that freedom.

Set realistic short-term goals that you can easily track. Keep It Simple, Stupid. I regularly tell myself this phrase. Simplicity is underrated. If you want to lose weight, it’s simple: move more, eat less. The same applies to net worth: make more, spend less, and invest.

Have an “abundance” mindset. There’s an abundance of opportunities, once you start looking. There’s an abundance of people you can meet to increase your worth, once you get out of your comfort zone. There’s an abundance of time, once you start being intentional with your hours.

You still need to sacrifice. Instant gratification is your biggest enemy. Being able to wait years for results is unfathomable to the average person. Not bingeing the latest TV show is hard. Stoicism is a great way to stave off instant gratification & learn self discipline.

Have a routine. Building productive habits that allow you to get into deep focused work is an invaluable tool.

Live below your means as much as possible, but spend lavishly on things you deeply care about. I bought a modest house 5 years ago for under $200,000. The main reason I bought it? So I could have a garage for my $50,000 Tesla.

Life is short. Don’t let money run it. My wife & I decided we love to grow our own veggies & herbs to save money on groceries. But we will gladly spend thousands on a trip to Switzerland, Italy, and Scotland. Find what's important to you and don't feel ashamed about it.

Time and health are your most valuable assets in life. It’s okay to be selfish with these two things.

Finally, there's no absolute right way to go about becoming a millionaire. Like with all things in life, it's the journey that you'll remember.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-04-18,My lessons toward FIRE: Hit $2.3M net worth at 52,"My lessons toward FIRE: Hit $2.3M net worth at 52 I learned about FIRE in later 2018 (when I was 50). I was usually maxing out my 401k, but I was not very intentional about my goals. I’m 52M married to a 53F with two adult kids (one finished graduate school the other will graduate college in 2022 with no debt). My FIRE number is about 3.5M which I hope to hit by 2027 or sooner. I’m interested in FI (financial independence) but not the RE (Retire Early) part as much. I might be “retire earlier” at 59 instead of 67. My wife currently doesn’t work outside the home (she retired early, later we had kids, and she went full-time mom).

**Background**:

High income in MCOL area. First in my family to graduate college. My initial career was focused on public service, working for a local government agency. I didn’t like this work, and after college, I transitioned into technology as a programmer still in my early 20s. I worked crazy hours at startups and Fortune 500 companies for many years. A few years ago, I pivoted to a new industry but remained in technology. The new company is lower stress and more sustainable. Recently I took an internal transfer out of technology into a business role after earning another advanced degree.

No debts except mortgage (340K) and about 300K in equity. On pace to pay off the mortgage in 11 years with a 2.375% rate. I could pay it off even faster, but that interest rate is so low…

**Breakdown of investments**:

\- IRA = 920K   
\- Spouse IRA = 200K  
\- 401k traditional = 445K   
\- 401K Roth = 12K   
\- 457b = 80K 

\-  Brokerage = 260K  
\-  Cash = 90K

Things I’ve learned on my FIRE journey - and things that have made me appreciate the FIRE community:

1. I’m not as interested in retiring early because my family doesn’t have a strong generic track record of longevity. I need to have fun along the way, and no one is promised tomorrow. I do save money, but I also spend money on things that have meaning to me including a lot of travel. (well at least before the pandemic). I like having a top-tier health insurance plan from work.

2. FIRE taught me about travel hacking. I was able to get a companion pass on Southwest for my wife, and now we travel together even on business trips. This has been life-changing, and we go visit our kids.

3. FIRE inspired me to explore a side hustle. Not so much for the extra money, but more for pursuing a part-time role that I might transition into instead of an abrupt retirement.  I now teach two college classes online. I’ve met new people, and I’m helping others. It has done a lot to reinvigorate my mental health after a year+ pandemic and working from home. It’s also helped me avoid tech job burnout that seems to be common by giving me other interesting problems to consider while helping others. I save 100% of this extra income compared to about 25% of my regular income.

4. FIRE helped me to understand other options beyond just 401k retirement savings. That’s all I used to do. When I became eligible to also participate in a 457b, I ramped that and I started making catch-up contributions the year I turned 50. In 2020, I maxed out on the 457b. I’m now also making contributions to a Roth 401K with a generous match.

5. FIRE taught me to save outside of retirement accounts too. I now have an emergency fund and a sizable brokerage account focused on index funds. This has given me TREMENDOUS freedom that I hadn’t imagined before. I now think of it as my Financial Independence money (I find the term F U money to be a bit vulgar for my tastes). If something happened, or if I couldn’t cope with the stress of my employment, I could make a change, and everything would be OK. A few years ago, that would have been stressful. I would always adapt to whatever insane deadline my employer would demand. I’ve intentionally moved to a better company, and less demanding role – and I’m happier! I have improved work/life balance and sufficient vacation to have fun with my family.

6. FIRE helped me to understand that I don’t have to wait until I’ve 59 to access retirement accounts! The rule of 55 was a revelation to me that will give me new options in just a couple of years.

7. FIRE taught me to use the Personal Capital app to calculate my FIRE number and monitor expenses. All of my investments are basically low-cost index mutual funds from Vanguard or Fidelity - except my wife’s IRA.  She’s paying high fees for an investment advisor on her 200K. I’ve encouraged her to consider my strategies, and we will continue to revisit. 

8. I mostly buy used cars or occasionally a new one and drive it into the ground. I bought my kids late-model used cars as gifts, and I drive a used 2017, and my wife drives a used 2015. All paid for at this point. I will admit that as I have gotten older and I’ve managed to achieve financial goals – I’m tempted to buy a new 2022 Corvette when my youngest kid finishes college next spring.

9. My kids have read “Simple Path to Wealth” at my request, and they are applying these principles now. I wish I had learned them in my 20s! My older kid already has an emergency fund and brokerage account. FIRE has taught me how to better prepare and teach my kids.

10. I could work to lower my expenses and retire earlier; I’m just choosing not to pursue this right now. I have made some changes inspired by this forum, like switching to T-Mobile, keeping my iPhone for 4 years, and extending the life of my laptop to 5 years. Before FIRE, I would splurge on tech frequently. I still buy incredibly cool tech; I just now have a disciplined schedule of tech refresh that is not frequent.

Anyway, I attribute a lot of my success to what I’ve learned here over the past 3 years! I don’t post much, but I learn a lot here so I thought I’d share what I’ve learned so far.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-04-18,Is it a horrible idea to share NW or portfolio with friends?,"Is it a horrible idea to share NW or portfolio with friends? My friends and I are all in our mid 20s to early 30s and we have been increasingly talking about stocks, investments, crypto, etc. I feel like with all the news its a popular thing to talk about right now. (GME squeeze, bitcoin, doge coin, elon musk tweets, etc.)

The thing is that my friends don't really have real money in there. Maybe like 5k - 20k at most. The reason I say not 'real' is that they don't take it that serious. They treat is more of as half investing half entertainment and they are open about their positions, balance, etc.

I am reluctant to jump into the convos because I've spent the last 5 years building it up fat and it has ballooned to almost 1 mil. So when they start pulling up their phone and sharing their trades I always pause.

On one side these are my best friends and I have known them forever. Also I love talking about stocks and finance. On the other side I am scared that it will come off as showing off. I am also worried they might look at me different.

2021-04-10,Should I baristaFIRE or go for a career change?,"Should I baristaFIRE or go for a career change? I am a 31 year old dentist. I thought about cutting back on dentistry in 2019 but I ended up switching from a 32 hour a week job to a 50 hour a week job with a 50% increase in income right before the pandemic began. The timing was good because even though my current job consumes all my time and energy, there is nothing else to do during the pandemic so I didn't mind. I cannot see myself working at this pace when the pandemic is over so I am pondering my next step.

I saved up for tuition for endodontics residency beginning in the summer of 2020 but I didn't get in. Luckily, I had nearly all my money liquid in a money market account. I invested most into stocks and index funds near the bottom of the V shaped recovery when Trump started pumping the market. I am currently at around a half million net worth which at the 4% rule, pretty much covers my annual living expenses. I anticipate working at my current job another half year and adding another $75k or so.

This fall, I would like to enroll in a post-bacc online program for a second bachelors in computer science and try my hand at a second career as a software developer. I would like to be a full time student at first to complete the beginning of the prerequisite tree and then be a part time student while working as a dentist part time, maintaining degree seeking student status so I can try to get internships.

My parents and dentist peers are urging me to stick with dentistry because I have great hands and although I can excel at a dexterity-based profession, I may do much worse in the field of tech where intelligence and mental stamina is paramout. I feel that I have a strong safety net and can return to dentistry if the career switch isn't successful or I don't like software development. If I follow their advice and stick with dentistry, I would like to baristaFIRE and work the easiest and lowest hour workweek dental job that grants me health insurance. I think some may offer it at 0.5-0.6 FTE with a 3 day workweek where I will still likely be making low six figures and with my frugal nature, may still be maintaining a savings rate >50% of gross.

I've reached a state of unconscious mastery as a general dentist and each day at work I'm on autopilot and sort of zone out and am dispassionately trading time and energy for money. I worry that I am sleepwalking through life and my window of opportunity to learn CS is closing as I get older. Should I take the risk on a career switch or coast until I reach Medicare age?

Thank you!

Edit: I want to go into programming out of a FOMO. Dentistry represents to me what is known, predictable, and stagnant. A lot of my childhood friends went into tech and had varying degrees of success at Facebook, Google, Amazon, as well as many unknown companies. Some are doing well, some holding on, and some programming careers have already sputtered out. I took the relatively safe and cowardly route of going into healthcare. However, I was just as smart as many of my FAANG-tier friends and feel I sold myself short when I could have really applied myself and could work on exciting new tech.",0.0,Neutral,English

Hi all. I was wondering if you could provide some perspective. I am a 30 year old scientist.I am not close to FI but I recently realized that I am in the position to be there in about 5-7 years if I keep plodding along in my very stable job. However, this realization, while it is something that I always wanted, is making me much less motivated to get anything done. I could phone it in and probably do fine until I RE.

2021-03-19,"Changing career to tech, from the bottom of the field to $1.3M in Net Worth.","Changing career to tech, from the bottom of the field to $1.3M in Net Worth. I (35M married, 2 kids) recently read [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/m8kd16/my_journey_to_fi2m_in_net_worth_from_absolute/) about someone working in tech and most of the comments read ""tldr: win the lottery"" or similar.  I was therefore inspired to post about my experience *changing careers* into a technical field and how it helped me amass almost **$1.3M net worth**.  I don't live in the Bay Area, I live in the midwest in a town of about 1M people approximately half the cost-of-living as you'd see in the Bay Area.

This is a long post with a good deal of personal growth history, but hopefully if others are considering a career change to tech - this can help in some way.  Additionally, I sprinkled in advice where I could.

**Previous Career:**

I graduated college in late 2000s with an MS in Engineering and was earning a decent living as an engineer.  In 2009, at the height of the housing crisis, I was laid off just before eligibility to test for PE (getting to stamp drawings as an engineer).  Because of the rough market place and the fact that I was competing for jobs with PEs, I was out of work for a very long time.  I ended up getting a job working nights managing a construction crew while I still searched for a job during the days.

**Deciding to Change (Early 2010):**

Eventually I decided that I had to make a career change, I was struggling so much.  I applied for a job to develop software applications with zero background at an insurance company.  Because they weren't paying market rates, they were willing to take chances on people without software backgrounds.  I was so thankful to have a job offer, I didn't bother negotiating and accepted the job right away.  **\*Mistake, always negotiate\***

**Hard work:**

I had to teach myself how to develop, the job was very much a trial-by-fire.  I spent all my free time working on software, trying to understand the IDE and language.  I built a website showcasing my engineering projects.  As my learning progressed, so did my career.  Because the place typically underpaid and hired non-software background employees it was easy to start to rise in the ranks.  I moved to Software Developer II, then Software Developer III, then Lead Software Developer.

Additionally, I enrolled in night classes for another MS, this time in cybersecurity.  Building software was interesting to me, but so was cybersecurity.  I thought if I coded all day and studied security it would be a good way to diversify my knowledge.  I made the case to the company that it was a good investment and they paid for everything (while I worked there).  My job was also flexible because not every graduate class was available at night, some were done over lunch.  I was constantly on the move between my job and my university.

I felt pretty good about myself at this point and felt like I was ready for a career change.  I decided to propose to my now wife and spent a lot of time building an engagement website which taught me even more.

**You know nothing (Mid 2014):**

When I felt at the top of my game, I had an opportunity to compete at a hackathon with a couple of my coworkers.  While there, I realized that I wasn't even *close* to the skill levels of the other competitors.  And the code they were writing seemed so modern, so elegant and just all around better than what I did day-to-day.  **To this day, I credit doing terrible in this hackathon with making my career.**  Literally, the day after the hackathon I started looking for other jobs and had interviews within a week.

**First job change (Mid-Late 2014):**

Switching careers was interesting, I was still making significantly less than what I was previously.  However, having a job offer on the table allowed me options to try to make up the difference.  I'm sure there are plenty of good negotiation materials out there, so I'll keep my advice short and sweet.

>I kept saying ""no, I'm worth X based on my research and experience."" In almost every offer where I've used this tactic, it has worked out and the hiring manager eventually meets my target.  I always start off my explaining my reasoning and end with a line like, ""if you and I disagree on my value now, I'm afraid we'll disagree every time we discuss my value.""

After a couple rounds of emails, they eventually met my target ($70k).  One of the considerations in my negotiations involved the fact that I still had two years left in my MS in cybersecurity and would have to pay $15k per semester out of pocket.  The savvy readers will note I ""lost"" money by changing careers before I graduated, but I would argue the immediate learning cliff I had to scale was worth it.

New coding language, new environment, new OS even made for a steep cliff, but I was surrounded by people smarter than me.  **It is easy to learn when everyone can teach you**.  Again, I began learning and coding outside of work.  I started incorporating these new technologies into my homework for school.  I bought more domains and built fun websites.  My learning outside of work was beginning to eclipse the time spent working at work.

**New job, new child (Mid 2016):**

It's been said before, but one of the best things for building a career is diversity.  Diversity (i.e. a new job) is also the best way to ramp up salary.  An interesting opportunity came up when I was just about to have my first child where a local business had expressed interest in me via LinkedIn.  This is a pretty common occurrence now-a-days, but was quite new for me back then.  I interviewed well, asked for $90k and got it without needing to negotiate.

**Getting an Itch:**

I liked this new job, but there was incredible pressure as a developer.  I was also just finishing my MS degree and started to really think about opportunities in security.  My team won a hackathon and they wanted to hire us so I started looking into options at this company in the security space.

**Changing Careers Again (Mid 2017):**

I moved into a security career.  My wife and I bought a house at about \~$500k with a \~$100k downpayment.  We spent up for a house that we plan on keeping for 20+ years.  Our savings mainly amounted from the fact that we lived with our parents for so long - we were both about 22 before we moved out and both of us had been working since we were 15.  Additionally, we were driving old cars 2001 and 2004.  


>Because we were able to put 20% down payment, we had no PMI to worry about and also chose to manage our own escrow.  We did this by automatically depositing money into a separate account from each paycheck that would approximately add up to what we owed at year's end.  This is important because we're able to earn interest on that money all year long rather than paying it straight to the bank.

**Security Jobs (2017 - present):**

I've remained in cybersecurity as I really enjoy it and it pays pretty well.  The post that inspired mine mentioned that he only worked about 5 hours a day, and I wanted to comment on that as it seemed to garner a lot of hate.

First off, it's totally possible in tech to work short hours.  Especially once you know what you're doing.  But, it's a major struggle to get to that place.  That's why my history was so extensive...  I think it's important to note the effort it takes to get to a situation where you can help architect a project without actually spending all day building it.

Secondly, the less pressure your job has, the easier it is to accomplish these minimal hours.  I've worked at places that were in total maintenance mode.  You could survive forever at a job like that with minimal hours once you know the business/process.  (In fact, a lot of my coworkers are still there).  


>Once you understand the basics of the tech, learning the business is the biggest difference you can make in your career with a company.  If you understand why you're doing something, and can execute that vision, it'll pay huge dividends eventually.

I've also worked at places that were undergoing major rehauls or had insane agile/sprint velocity targets.  I think that it would be extremely difficult in this type of environment to get away with working half time.

**Active Income:**

I'm not going to go into too many details here because it'll dox me, but I also own an LLC that does some additional side work, like development, educational videos, etc.  When I joined the tech industry, there were not a lot of meetups/groups to join, so I helped build some of those communities and it has morphed into a side job that brings in a little extra money each year.  Additionally, I still participate in many competitions throughout the year which typically brings in another $5k-10k per year, depending on my finishes.  For simplicity sake, I've summed that up as ""Active Income"" in the Current Situation section below.

**Salary Timeline:**  I've included this because I know people like it, it doesn't really mess with the story much.  My wife's salary has gone from $35k to $80k during this same timeframe.

2009 Engineering: 77k  
2010 Developer: 40k  
2014 Developer: 58k (raises/promotions)  
2014 Developer: 70k (job change)  
2016 Developer: 90k (job change)  
2017 Security: 105k (job change)  
2018 Security: 115k  
2019 Security: 155k (job change)  
2020 Security: 165k  
2021 Security: 190k

**Current:**  Wife and I hate debt, so we've paid off the house when we had some company equity go public.  We probably would've made more by leaving in the market, but this made us happier.

House Paid Off:  \~$616k (in value)  
401k and IRA: $511k  
Stocks + Cash: $140k  
Emergency Fund: $30k  
\---------------------------------

Total Salary (wife & me):  \~$270k per year  
Active Income (LLC / competitions): \~$30k-$35k per year  
Expenses:  \~$44k (dropping soon to $32k with public school for eldest child)

&#x200B;

>We've maxed out each of our 401Ks and IRAs since the early 2000s.  I've aggressively allocated both of those and our brokerage account.  I know this flies in the face of a lot of the FIRE advice, but I tend to pick individual stocks that I feel ~~solve~~ leverage the human condition of laziness.  \[thanks /u/eightpackdude\]    
>  
>Not just stuff like $AMZN and $SHOP, but also $KR, $V, $MA, and $NFLX.

If you're considering the move to a tech career, I hope this post brings some insight into the kind of up front work it'll take, but also demonstrates that it's worth it.  Similar to the [inspiration for this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/m8kd16/my_journey_to_fi2m_in_net_worth_from_absolute/) I anticipate the climb from $1M to $2M to be much quicker than the struggle up to $1M net worth.  


**Edit:**  
For those commenting about how dumb it was to do X, Y, and Z... we know.  This post wasn't intended to be optimal instructions on how to best gain the money for FIRE, it was about my wife and I and how we accomplished it.  Fiscally, I noted several mistakes, including:

1. Gaining $12k/yr in job change, but losing $30k/yr for first two years in grad school.
2. Putting $100k downpayment to avoid PMI instead of investing and earning more than the PMI would cost.
3. Paying off house in 4 years instead of putting market into biggest bull market ever.
4. Sitting in individual stocks instead of the low cost index funds that are so popular in this sub.

Honestly, I'm sure there were even more ""fiscal mistakes"" along the way.  My wife works in finance, so her aversion to debt came from her career and my aversion to debt came from my upbringing.  To us, paying off debt (even a mortgage) was more important than savings.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-03-16,Reached my Number. Now I must wait for COVID to pass in order to pull the plug.,"Reached my Number. Now I must wait for COVID to pass in order to pull the plug. Finally reached my FIRE number, but due to the complications of the current COVID situation, decided to stay at work keeping a holding pattern until things get resolved. I am sharing this information here because I rather not talk about it with family and friends for obvious reasons.

To be specific about the reason for the delay, SO and I are holders of the MM2H (Malaysia My Second Home) retirement VISA that we applied for a few years ago. Our plan is to retire and settle in the island of Penang, which is the second largest urban center in Malaysia and about 4 hours drive from Kuala Lumpur. However, because of COVID, any non-citizen trying to go in has to file a lot of paperwork and subject themselves to an expensive and very strict 14 day quarantine in a government designated hotel, and you cannot leave your room for any reason during these 14 days. Plus, as of right now, everyone in Malaysia is under severe movement restrictions. Because of that, I've decide that there is little benefit leaving right now and that we'll be better off keeping the status quo, collecting a steady paycheck and pulling the plug once the situation becomes a little more normal. We hope that with vaccines rolling out worldwide, things should be somewhat close to normal by the end of the year. If that assumption holds, I will be quitting my job then.  Before you ask: Yes, we have been to Malaysia. Several times, actually. So we know what we are getting into.

A little bit about ourselves.

\- SO and I are in our early 40s, with no dependents. We both immigrated to the US when we were teens and met at a local 3rd tier, accepts almost anyone, state university that you probably never heard of.

\- I work for a FAANG, but on the marketing side. SO stays at home. Total annual compensation is around $400K (salary + bonus + equity). We current live in a VHCOL area.

\- We rented our entire lives and plan on continue to do so after retirement. We have no real estate investments and no plans on acquiring any real estate in the future. Nothing against it, just not our thing.

\- $4M total in assets, mostly in VTSAX and VTIAX. About $3M in a taxable account and the rest in a 401K and Roth IRA.

\- Did not invest a single dime in crypto. Ever. I understand blockchain and its benefits, but I do not understand the value of cryptocurrencies as investment vehicle. Maybe I just too old and stupid to grasp it. But I congratulate everyone who got on the bandwagon early and made it big. You saw something I could not and still can't, so kudos to you.

We plan on living on \~$45K year in Malaysia. This would get us a luxury condo by the beach, platinum health coverage, plus a quite comfortable overall lifestyle with 1Gbs fiber home internet, generous groceries, budget to eat out, go to events, and the occasional travel.

Running the numbers, I think I might be able to live off dividends, even though that was not the original plan. We were originally planning a 3% SWR, but after visiting Malaysia, we realized that this might be overkill. The dividends alone from our Vanguard funds should be more than enough to finance our lifestyle. This will also means that I will not need to worry about the ups and downs of the stock market, which I find to be quite liberating.

To be clear, I am NOT advocating for a dividend investment strategy and we never adopted one ourselves. I only pointing out that for our particular case, we came to the realization later in the journey that dividends might be enough to pay for our needs.

&#x200B;

Happy to answer any questions, but will refrain from sharing any details that might help identify us.

2021-03-15,Post FIRE - 6 Month Report,"Post FIRE - 6 Month Report [Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/itmbmz/went_full_fire_today/)

tl;dr. FIREd 6 months ago with $3.2 million. Since then, spent $40k of $50k expected.  Net worth increased by $1.1 million, $150k was investments, $1 million was bitcoin.   

&#x200B;

On Sept 15, 2020, we decided to FIRE.  At the time, we had $3.2 million, estimated spending of $100k / year for a withdrawal rate between 3.1%  We really were not sure on our spending, so we put 1 years worth of expected spending into a few dedicated accounts and track our spending for 6 months.  Today we examined our finances to see where we are at and plan for the future.  

&#x200B;

**Investments & Net Worth:**  

We started FIRE 6 months ago at $3.2 million.  We are currently at $4.3 million.  To be brutally honest, Bitcoin dominated our finances.  But even discounting that, we would be fine.  Our regular investments went up by $150k, so our $40k in spending was fully covered and then some.  If the money we had in bitcoin was in more traditional investments instead, our investments would have gone up by $200k total.  We have index funds with 80% equity / 20% bonds mix.  We also keep about 1 year's spending in cash.  So classic FIRE would work for us so far.  However, Bitcoin has gone to the moon.  Before FIRE, whenever bitcoin went up we felt the need to sell some to help secure our FIRE strategy.  After FIRE, we are not selling as agressively because we will be FIRE even if bitcoin drops like a rock.  

&#x200B;

**Spending:**  

Most of my spending is household monthly bills (utilities/phone/internet/insurance) and amazon.   My wife's spending is groceries, gifts, take-out and donations.  

&#x200B;

**Account strategy:**  

We put $100k into a few specific accounts.  The accounts turned into a mess that was hard to decipher.  A family member repaying a $1500 loan (we wrote off as a gift), my company paying me a last partial bonus, my wife using the CC to buy groceries (that I pay for) for elderly relatives and getting cash from them.  Hopefully the next 6 months is easier, but with buying a new car & a big income tax bill, it is going to be tough to allocate regular spending vs. one time spending.  

&#x200B;

**Personal:**  

I have not missed work at all.  I have been able to home school my kids, take up chess again, spend some time programming for fun and started to eat more healthy & get fit.  We did not travel or scuba due to the pandemic, but I have plans for several trips once we feel safe travelling.  

&#x200B;

**Future:**  

We have adjusted to have $100k in cash across our accounts & on hand.  This year is going to be big expenses - my wife is going to get a new car, and we will likely have a $50k - $80k income tax bill.  Plus, our home is 17 years old so we are going to replace every major appliance that has not already been replaced (furnace, A/C, hot water heater, clothes washer, basement freezer, patio furniture, BBQ).  

&#x200B;

Finally, as usual, I am a full bottle into a good Pinot, so I will responds tomorrow. It probably looks like I get drunk all the time, but I don't normally drink - last time was Christmas, and before 6 months ago on the first FIRE night :)",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-03-14,FIRE-Focused Rent vs. Buy Calculator,"FIRE-Focused Rent vs. Buy Calculator TLDR: I made an [open-source FIRE-focused Rent vs. Buy Calculator](https://paytonjones.shinyapps.io/advanced_rent_buy_calculator/?fire=T)

There are a variety of Rent vs. Buy calculators online to help you with your decision. The [New York Times calculator](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) seems to be the go-to around here, and I also like the [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/rent-vs-buy-calculator) and [SmartAsset](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/rent-vs-buy) calculators.

I was recently in the process of making the decision to rent or buy, and made use of several of these calculators. However, I noticed some limitations that bothered me:

1. The visualizations are pretty limited. They show you the “correct” decision to make, but they don’t give you a ton of insight into why it’s the correct decision, or how your inputs affect that decision. I really wanted to visualize how the decision would impact the trajectory of my net worth over time, and I wanted to break down the different expenses in buying a home and compare with renting.
2. The methodology sections are not sufficiently clear to reproduce the math. As I’m sure is the case with many of you, I have a hard time trusting any calculator if I can’t reproduce the exact steps they take to get there.
3. One thing I appreciate about many FIRE calculators is that they allow you to model historical returns, rather than only a consistent, averaged return on stocks. This helps you appreciate the relative volatility of your choice (does your plan ever fail? what’s the best case and the worst case?). I couldn’t find this in existing rent vs. buy calculators.
4. They aren’t built with the mindset of FIRE, so it’s easy to miss key insights. For instance, they are always a bit cryptic with how they’re modeling your opportunity costs. Also, the setup of “which strategy is financially best over X years” can also lead you astray if you are planning to stop working after you hit your FIRE number. In that case, the relevant question is “which strategy helps me hit my FIRE number first”.

Mostly for my own benefit, I decided to make a little rent vs. buy calculator that addressed these concerns. I liked the result, so I thought it was worth the effort to make it open-source and share it with the community.

You can find the calculator here: [https://paytonjones.shinyapps.io/advanced\_rent\_buy\_calculator/?fire=T](https://paytonjones.shinyapps.io/advanced_rent_buy_calculator/?fire=T)

The source code is here: [https://github.com/paytonjjones/shiny-server/tree/master/advanced\_rent\_buy\_calculator](https://github.com/paytonjjones/shiny-server/tree/master/advanced_rent_buy_calculator)

I should note that there are definitely some weaknesses of my calculator and as always, you should cross-check with multiple tools. I’m not by any means a financial professional. It’s possible I’ve made errors, and the default values are simply based on basic Googling and comparison with other calculators. The NYT calculator has more parameters and although it is not open-source, it has really stellar documentation that can help you understand what each parameter means.

Happy calculating!

2021-03-12,I think I just FIREd,"I think I just FIREd I've been a grateful lurker here for awhile and applaud your efforts to help one another [design lives](https://designingyour.life/)  that are fruitful and satisfying!

Without knowing it, I've been on a Coast FIRE plan for a few decades.  I was single, fairly well paid in Silicon Valley, and living comfortably cheap (renting a room from a friend, modest high-mileage car, international travel as part of my work, volunteering a lot, happy to eat out regularly with friends), giving money away and investing the rest.  I inherited a couple of key commitments from my dad: (1) spend less than you make and (2) compound interest is miraculous. (He gave me a little money when I was 16, with the condition I'd meet with his broker and invest it.  Thanks tons for the lesson, Dad!)

My relationship to work seems to be an unusual one. When I was in graduate school, the folks paying my fellowship checked up with me each year to see how I was doing. I thought I needed to prove myself, that I was making sufficient progress toward the degree. But their only question was, ""Is there anyone or anything getting in the way of your doing what you think you should be doing?"" Since then, at each job, I've worked out a partnership where I'm doing what I think should be done, contributing my gifts as best I can for something that matters and I enjoy. Compensation is a good indicator that other people find it valuable too.

So at age 34, I was able to negotiate a year off from my tech research job to go back to school. My savings meant a year without salary wasn't a problem. They held my job for me, and even indulged my studying a second year, and then working remotely for a couple of years while my newfound wife finished her education.  That eventually grew to three more years of studying toward a second PhD (again with no income, but frugality and savings made it manageable), in a much lower paying field, yielding a 75% pay cut but again doing what I wanted to do.

Fast forward.... I've been working for a non-profit for eight years. It's pulled together my strange combination of education and skills, with a lower salary than my tech years (about 50%), but a fully livable salary for our family of four in a MCOL city (""spend less than you make""), and the savings of my youth still quietly growing in the background.

A couple of years ago my work situation changed. New management and new philosophy. I'm less valued and even seen as a threat. I'm no longer involved in the decisions that matter. We butt heads over some of those decisions. I decide this is no longer ""doing what I want to be and should be doing.""  So I resigned, effective next month.

At first I was scrambling for what my next thing might be. But then I decided to think soberly about our financial situation and lay out a ""what if?"" scenario if there is no next step that generates compensation. Lo and behold, my set-it-and-forget-it portfolio has done really well, and it looks like I'm at a very comfortable 2.5% withdrawal rate, even with additional health costs and having some fun with the extra time. So I think I just accidentally FIREd at age 54.

That said, I don't think I'm done. I've got a few friends reaching out to me to draw me into their ventures. The fear side of me makes me want to jump into something new, to not be spending money I'm not actively earning, but the FIRE voice keeps reminding me that I can be selective. I don't want to get into a bad situation just because I'm on the rebound.

Maybe my story will spark some helpful conversations. A few summary thoughts:

1. Saving early, if you can do it, yields tons of freedom.
2. FI (including being on a trajectory that is confidently leading to FI) isn't just about quitting working. It leads to the freedom to make unconventional career choices for building a meaningful life.
3. Don't be afraid of an upside down view of work, if it fits your situation: I've not begrudgingly let myself ""be used"" by my employer to accomplish their goals in exchange for money to pay my bills. I've ""used"" (or better, found synergy with) my employer, so that we're simultaneously accomplishing both our goals. In other words, I seek out an employer I can leverage toward a good thing I want to accomplish, and getting paid is a good indicator that we're doing something worthwhile together. I recognize not everyone can do this, and I'm deeply grateful that I could.
4. Cal Newport's [*So Good They Can't Ignore You*](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124) (along with his companion: [*Deep Work*](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/)) resonate with me. Newport's philosophy of building career capital in order to gain career autonomy and meaning really complements my take on the FIRE philosophy, even if it's not a fit for everyone.
5. Writing down a concrete post-FIRE plan (including cash flow, health insurance details, contingency plans for unexpected expenses, how to spend time the first few months) can remove lots of angst about resigning and launching into the unknown.

In 2020 respondents who did not want to be in the spreadsheet were not allowed to complete the survey. The 2017 format is a little different because the survey was done in SurveyMonkey, as opposed to Google Forms for 2018 & 2020. 2017 also suffered from lack of clarity in the time period responses should cover, which was corrected in later versions.*

2021-03-06,"Mega Backdoor Roth, In-Plan Conversions","Mega Backdoor Roth, In-Plan Conversions This might be old news for a lot of you, but I just learned it and wanted to share in case anyone else wasn't aware.   
Most of us are familiar with the Mega Backdoor Roth, where you can contribute up to $38,500 (2021, with no employer matching) to an after-tax 401k then do an in service distribution to your Roth IRA. The downside is you have to have a provider that allows not only after-tax contributions, but also in-service distributions, and any gains before the distribution are subject to taxes.  


I just learned another way of doing this is if your provider allows for in-plan conversions! This lets you contribute to the after-tax bucket, then convert it to a Roth 401k instead. Giving you the same tax sheltered access you'd get in a Roth IRA. I called my provider about this (Fidelity) and they not only knew exactly what i was talking about, they were excited about it and even set it up to automatically convert, so there is no chance for gains complicating the process. It was one phone call, that I never have to think about again. The downsides are of course being tied to your employer's 401k options, and the regular 401k penalties if you need to withdraw.  


I just wanted to share this because there is always such an emphasis on in-service distributions, which are rare, that I thought the Mega Backdoor Roth wasn't an option at all for me.   


If there's any important details I missed please let me know. This is new info to me that I just wanted to get the word out about but by no means am I an expert.

I’ve been reading posts from this sub for about two years now, but this is my first time posting. I hope some people get something out of this and I can continue providing updates in the future. I’m pretty open so I’d be happy to answer anyone’s questions (financial or otherwise).

# Background

I became interested in programming in high school. Originally I planned to major in computer science, but I had a great calculus teacher who convinced me computer engineering was a better choice (her son was currently studying computer engineering). The argument was that since computer engineers study hardware and software, there are more opportunities (computer engineers can take software or hardware jobs but computer scientists typically only take software jobs). I’m definitely focused on software, so in hindsight it probably wouldn’t have made much of a difference, but I definitely enjoyed the challenge of being in the engineering department.

My parents both have good jobs. My mom is a teacher in a public school (which although horrible to endure, has surprisingly good pay) and my father is a mechanical engineer. I’m super privileged in that I grew up without any unmet wants or needs. Additionally, they were thoughtful and planned for my future, contributing to a 529 (college savings account) regularly as I grew up. Overall, I only ended up paying \~$12k (about one semester’s cost) for my education. I realize that this isn’t typical and I’m extremely lucky. I paid this amount directly to my parents (partly while in school and partly after graduating), so I never had any student loans.

# College

I took school very seriously and did everything I could to set myself up for my future career. I graduated with a perfect GPA (4.0) which took an insane amount of work. I really enjoyed my major, so it was much easier for me to do well in core classes. The hard part was caring about classes not so related to engineering. Although I spent a lot of time on school work, it wasn’t my only focus and fortunately I got to meet some great friends along the way.

My school was really into its co-op program, so sophomore year I started looking for one (although it’s more common these days, if anyone hasn’t heard of a co-op, it is basically a multiple rotation internship, i.e. you work at a company for a semester three or four separate times in between semesters at school). It seemed like a great deal to me since you can gain experience for your eventual career, in a lot of cases make a great salary, and gain three credits by the end. Although I wanted to start working in the summer, which is the most competitive time, I was fortunate to receive an offer. The position was in the financial industry, which wouldn’t be my first choice, but I remember being absolutely baffled when seeing the pay. $25/hr for someone with only half of their degree completed? Sign me up! I also got a raise to $30/hr my last rotation (senior year) which is a crazy amount to be making for someone still in school. This is when I started becoming interested in FIRE, reading about how to invest, opening a roth IRA, devouring MMM articles, etc. Most people take 4.5-5 years to finish their degree if they have a co-op, but I ended up graduating on time, in May of 2020.

# Career

I wanted to stay in the same city where I went to school since it’s where I grew up and where my parents live. I would classify it as MCOL and the ratio of salaries to COL is actually quite high, so I saw no reason to leave (although the thought of living in a closet in silicon valley while making $300k/year was tempting 😉).

I received an offer from the company where I had my co-op with a salary of \~$80k. I was obviously excited, and I realize that is a huge amount for most people, but based on my college career and previous experience I thought I could do better. I spent a lot of time during my last semester studying for technical interviews and improving my skills with data structures and algorithms. After applying to a bunch of different places, I got a response from a top tech company. I was ecstatic about the opportunity, but super nervous about the interview since they are notoriously brutal. Thanks to covid, I had to do the interviews virtually, which was a bummer. I was looking forward to my first grueling all-day-long set of in-person interviews, but hey, global pandemics. The experience turned out to be a lot different than I expected; everyone was very personable, and the technical interview was much easier than I would have thought. Anyway, fast forwarding, I got this offer:

&#x200B;

|Salary|$94k|
|:-|:-|
|Signing Bonus|$20k|
|Stock Bonus|$70k (distributed over four years)|

This was already much, much better than the offer from the company where I had my co-op. Nonetheless, I’ve read a lot about negotiating salaries and I’m a big advocate for it. Especially in this scenario where I had more than one offer. The worst the company can say is “No” but the upside is huge: all (most?) bonuses and raises are based on your salary. Therefore, increasing your initial salary works just like compound interest. Without the boring negotiation details, I ended up with:

&#x200B;

|Salary|$94k|
|:-|:-|
|Signing Bonus|$40k (distributed over two years)|
|Stock Bonus|$70k (distributed over four years)|

Amortizing the long-running compensation brings us out to about $131.5k/year. Wow, I certainly never expected to make that amount of money right after college.

I’m sure at this point many people are rolling their eyes (if anyone has continued reading this far, anyway). I know not everyone is interested in being a software engineer and it’s not possible to earn this much in many fields. Hopefully the rest of this post is still relevant, though.

# Numbers

I started tracking my expenses in a spreadsheet when I graduated. Here are the rough monthly numbers by category:

&#x200B;

|Rent|$850|
|:-|:-|
|Utilities|$215|
|Groceries|$200|
|Craft Beer|$200|
|Restaurants|$150|
|Insurance|$60|
|Gifts/Donations|$200|
|Clothes|$10|
|Car|$100|
|Entertainment|$50|
|Misc|$250|
|Total|$2,300|

Points of interest:

* I live in a two bedroom apartment \~10 min from the city. I split the cost with my girlfriend who has a similar background/story.
* In some ways my budget reminds me of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dril/status/384408932061417472?s=20). I know it’s pretty crazy to spend the same amount on beer as groceries, but it’s the one area where I splurge a bit. Just for clarification, I typically only drink on the weekends. The high cost is more because the beer is expensive and less because I drink a lot of it.
* I don’t have to pay for health insurance, so the insurance category is car insurance and renters insurance. I know this is another area where I’m insanely lucky.
* The “Car” expense isn’t a lease or anything, I have an old Toyota. During inspection this year there were some relatively costly repairs I needed.

Other than those expenses, I’m currently maxing my 401k, roth IRA, and HSA. I contribute 15% of my salary to my ESPP and any extra money I dump straight into VTSAX in a taxable account (up until recently, when I started saving for a down payment). Here is my current account/net worth break down:

&#x200B;

|Description|Account Type|Value|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cash|Checking account|$3.5k|
|Emergency Fund|HYSA|$13.5k|
|Down Payment|HYSA|$800|
|HSA|Investment (100% stocks)|$2.2k|
|401k|Investment (\~95% stocks)|$30k|
|IRA|Investment (100% stocks)|$15k|
|Taxable Account|Investment (100% VTSAX)|$17.5k|
|Stock awards|Investment (100% company stock)|$13k|
|ESPP|Investment (100% company stock)|$1k|
|Fun Investments|Stocks/REITs|$4k|
|Total||\~$100k|

As mentioned countless times in this sub, the best strategy (regardless of income) is to keep expenses low and invest the rest. I honestly don’t think much would change in this regard if I made half as much or twice as much as I currently do. Although a lot of people say “money can’t buy happiness”, we’re surrounded by people and advertising that tell us just the opposite. Most people spend a lot of their lives with the focus of finding a better job, getting promoted, making more money, etc. I’m in the unique position to have achieved that goal early, and as odd as it may seem, it’s a crushing reality to hit that feeling of “this is all there is”. I’m in the process of finding things I enjoy doing (reading, playing chess, cooking, making reddit posts 😏) so that I have something to retire to when I get to that point in the (hopefully not so distant) future. I think it’s commonly missed but something that’s very important to focus on.

My tentative FIRE goals are to retire at 45 with $2.3 million at a 3.47% withdrawal rate ($80k/year). The withdrawal rate was based on the max “fail-safe” rate using an active glide path. [This article](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/09/13/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-19-equity-glidepaths/) really changed my thoughts on withdrawal rates and I highly recommend reading. My withdrawal rate will allow about 3x my current spending since I want to have a lot of wiggle room. I’ll most likely take a lot of trips and donate the extra money at the end of each month.

This got quite long, so thanks for reading if you made it this far. I’d love to continue doing NW updates if people are interested. As I mentioned at the beginning, I’m happy to answer any questions.",0.0,Neutral,English

# Quick Stats

Net worth: $1MM + 100K home equity + 20K car equity

Budget: 40K per year

Age: 27

# The career

tl;dr: Software 2016-2021, huge salary and got lucky with stock.

I owe a debt of gratitude to my parents for teaching me frugality, to my brother for teaching me how to be a high achiever, and to the internet for filling in the rest of the gaps. This journey really starts in 2007 when I started high school. My local state university had a full-ride scholarship, and I decided I was going get it.

In college, I picked a comp sci major because it was the most lucrative option that I was interested in. Leaving college, I had 40K in my pocket thanks to the scholarship, high paying internships, jobs for professors, living with family, and working jobs in high school. I built a strong resume, and practiced interviewing intensely, so I could basically pick whatever company I wanted to work for.

I picked a pre-IPO company over a FAANG, which shouldn't have been the right call, but I got very lucky. My interviews went so well that I started out at a Software Eng. II position, which basically means I got a promotion before even starting. My mentor/manager there was incredible, and I owe much of my career success to him. Over the next three years, I was promoted once as an engineer and then promoted to management. The company IPO-ed and the stock popped!

That's really the peak of my career. I burnt out after that, and moved into a non-management role within the company. This didn't really help, so I jumped to another company where I worked as a engineer for about half a year before going back into management. This too didn't really help, and I never got back onto my A-game. I truly love building software, but I am just so over working for large companies.

Between negotiating great salaries, getting big raises, and most importantly my companies' stocks doing incredibly well, I now have $1MM.

# About the Money...

tl;dr: 4% rule. 40K expenses, $1MM invested + 120K home/car equity.

## FIRE Number

My FIRE number was originally 750K, but as I got closer to it, I realized that is was too low. Healthcare costs rise as you get older, and I want to do more travelling than I initially budgeted. I blew past 750K and didn't immediately quit.

It gets easier (and I got lucky). The first 500K took me 4.5 years in the workforce. The second 500K took me six months.

## Budget

I spent 30K in 2020 and I could have lived leaner, but 30K was a comfortable balance of frugality and splurging. For 2021, I am budgeting 40K. This differs from my 2020 budget by adding $2,820 for health insurance, $1,800 to amortize vehicle purchases, and the rest is for transportation/travel/entertainment that wasn't possible during a pandemic.

## Investments

My investment breakdown is roughly:

* 46% VTI
* 40% company stocks (from where I worked)
* 9% VT 
* 5% 401(k) (fairly diverse ETFs, almost all equities)

The goal is 100% VTI, but I can't dot it yet for tax reasons.

Why no bonds? What about the sequence-of-returns risk? Well, if the sequence-of-returns is really good, then I am set for life. If it is really bad, then I will go back to work and top up. My career capital is my hedge against that risk. I can also reduce spending during hard times.

## Social Security

To qualify for social security, you need 10 years of work. My three weeks of work this month are enough to count as a whole year. This puts me at 9 years, so I will need to make 6K some year in the future. While I am not counting on social security, it would be nice. So I will do a gig or turn a profit on a hobby sometime between now and 65.

# About Life...

2020 was great financially, but otherwise terrible for me. I suffered from depression which was fueled by a cycle of stress from being behind at work causing me to get further behind at work. I already feel much better.

## Do I tell people I am retired?

A few people who are very familiar with my FIRE plans know that I am retired. Everyone else, I am telling that I am taking a one year break from the corporate world. I want to leave that door open, and one year may change my perspective.

## Goals and Hobbies

I need to lose some weight and get in better shape. I have also been single since the start of the pandemic and I do want a long-term partner. But I am not in a hurry. Being retired and single is the pinnacle of freedom.

I have two hobbies that might actually make me money. There is a website I am building, and super excited to launch. I am also designing some board games that I want to kickstart. The idea of making money on these is exciting because it would be purely disposable income. There is also a certain thrill of making something valuable enough that others are willing to pay for it.

I am not worried at all about being bored. There are places to hike/backpack, board games to play, friends to catch up with, places to visit, code to write, and so much more. For the first time in a long time, I am excited to wake up each morning!",0.0,Neutral,English

**Introduction**

Despite stellar Q2’ 21 Earnings, $60M in revenue and yet another revenue guidance raise, Opera stock dropped further to \~$9. It is now trading at year to date lows and offers significant value upside to patient investors. Following are the highlights from Opera’s Q2 ’21 results.

* 87% QoQ Revenue Growth to $60.2M — A beat by $4.1M(7% beat to midpoint)
* 17% sequential increase in revenue — Largest increase since going public
* Breakeven adjusted EBITDA
* 95% gross margin
* 49% sequential increase in Opera News revenue
* Increased FY ’21 revenue guidance 2nd time this year to $242-247M ( 48% YoY growth at midpoint)
* Adjusted EBITDA FY ’21 guidance of $10-$20M
* Cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities of \~$200M
* After Seeing good results, reiterated plans to continue investing AEBITDA growth into growth objectives of growing Opera News in Western markets, scaling Dify in additional geographies and new products, and investing in the Opera Gaming division.

**Opera By the Numbers**

I am using data from 2020 Annual filing(20-F) and the most recent monetization of Opera's 29% preferred shares to make the case on how undervalued Opera is and how market is not giving any valuation to Opera's core business which is generating $245M of annual revenue(FY' 21 estimated) and aggressively investing for future growth by plowing all adjusted EBITDA growth from FY' 20 to expand into new verticals and geographies.

* Market Cap: \~$1B
   * Cash, cash equivalent & marketable securities : \~$200M
   * Book value of starmaker(35% discount/DLOM) : $55M
   * Book value of Nanobank : $266M
   * Book value of Opay(15% discount/DLOM) : $49M
* Opera Core= 1$B - $200M - $370M = $430M
   * Opera GM = 95%
   * Opera's AEBITDA Goal = 25%-30% of revenue
      * Proved from Q4'20 results that they can operate at 28% AEBITDA margin
      * Opera's FY'21 Investments - All adjusted EBITDA growth in FY '21 is invested back in business to expand in Europe and N. America
* Opera FY' 21 Forecast(high end) - $247M revenue, $20M AEBITDA
   * **Trading at \~1.7 x FY'21 Est. Revenue**

**The recent $400M Opay funding round from Softbank at $2B valuation and subsequent monetization of 29% of Opera's preferred share in OPay at $50M shows how undervalued Opera minority investments are on the books**.

* Opay is valued at \~$2B post money, and although Opera has not officially disclosed its latest stake, as per my calculations, Opera’ stake of 13.1%(10.24% Preferred shares + 2.86% Ordinary shares) got diluted to \~10.5% after the latest $400M funding round from Softbank. Since then, Opera sold 29% of its preferred shares, its latest stake dropped to \~8% which is now worth \~$160M compared to $49M which they have on the books.
* Starmaker’s 19.6% stake is valued on the books at $55M valuing starmaker at \~$280M. Similar to Opay, Starmaker,  which is profitable and has Q1 FY '21 revenue run rate of \~$180M -- 41% sequential increase from $127M run rate at end of 2020 -- , is valued on Opera’s book at massive discount.
* Nanobank, where Opera has 42% stake and valued on books at $266M,  has been sequentially growing at 10-15% since its covid bottom and should reach pre-covid run rate of $120M during Q1 2022.

Whichever multiple one is comfortable with for Opera Core business, which has gross margins of 95% with 25-30% AEBITDA margin profile, growing at 48% YoY in FY'21 and should continue to grow between 20-25% for next several years due to investments into growing new legs in fintech/cashback and gaming and also expanding in Europe and America where advertising impression are 10x better monetized compared to Africa and Asia, where majority of its 400M users are currently located, it is hard not to see how undervalued Opera is.

* If you use 4x revenue multiple with the book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \~1.6B ( \~$15 per ADS) -- 66% appreciation potential based on $9 SP.
* If you use 6x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \~2.1B ( \~20 per ADS) --122% Appreciation potential
* If you use 8x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \~2.6B ( \~25 per ADS) -- 177% Appreciation potential
* If you start applying growth multiples to Opera with the assumption that Opera can grow faster than 20-25% with modest success in Gaming and Fintech initiatives and get to 20-30% AEBITDA margin profile by FY’23, you can assign a 10x-12x revenue multiple to Opera and valuation would be much higher.

**Opera History**

Opera Ltd, the Opera browser company, was established in Norway in 1996  and is one of the few survivors from the Internet Explorer era of early 2000 . It was bought by a consortium led by Yahui Zhou in 2016 for $600M. In 2018, It was listed on Nasdaq as OPRA.

Now, Opera is no longer just a browser company. In fact, its core browser business only contributes about half of its revenue through search and ad monetization. The other half of revenue is contributed by advertising, mostly via its Opera news app which is now a top 10 news app on both android and iOS in all of Africa, Germany, France, UK and now in the US. What Opera has done successfully is to take its browser user base of 300 million MAUs and then get them to other services like News, Fintech and Gaming. Opera calls it Browser+ strategy.

It also used its browser user base to spin off 2 very successful businesses:

* OPay, a leading mobile wallet and mobile money operator in Nigeria where it had 13.1% stake(as of FY’ 20) which most recently raised $400M at $2B valuation.
* Nanobank, a micro credit provider in emerging markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America where it has 42% stake. Nanobank was doing $117M quarterly revenue at 30% AEBITDA margin pre-covid, but it is still recovering from covid impact in its biggest market - India and had Q2' 21 revenue of $57M at \~3% AEBITDA margin. Opera merged its fintech business in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank with 42% stake in August 2020.

It also opportunistically invested $30M for 19.35% stake in starmaker -- a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists -- and is growing like a wildfire, 250% YoY growth to $180M run rate in Q1' 21 with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M revenue run rate in Q4'20.

**Opera Products**

**Opera browser :** Amongst the giants, Apple Safari and Google Chrome, Opera has built a niche and cult following of users who like Opera browser for many of its differentiated features - Integrated Messaging apps, Integrated music players, built in VPN, ad blocker and many more. Opera browser for desktop is available on  MacOS, Windows and Linux and has seen install base growing from 42 million MAUs in 2016 to 80 million MAUs in 2020, a CAGR of 17%. Opera Mobile browser and its data saving browser Opera Mini, have grown from 164 million to 190 million MAUs, a CAGR of 4%.

**Opera GX :** Opera GX, the gaming browser which Opera launched for Gamers with differentiated features like CPU and RAM limiter, Gaming aesthetics, discord integration and Gaming corner which surfaces deals and news related to Games. Since its launch in June 2019, It has grown to over 10 million MAUs in just over 2 years.

**Opera News App :** Opera News is AI based News aggregator which personalizes the news based on their browsing history. It is #1 news app in all of the major African economies  - Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya and Ghana. Since its launch in Germany, France, UK and US in Q4'20, It has become #1 or #2 news apps in Germany, France and the UK and in the top 10 in the US. It has grown at 42% CAGR -- from 72 million MAUs in Q4'17 to 211 million MAU in Q4'20 and is growing revenue at 160% YoY as of Q4'20.

**Opera Ad Network :** Opera is one of the top 10 publishers of media impression given its scale in browser and its news app. Instead of relying on 3rd party ad networks, Opera has launched its own ad network, primarily to serve its own ad inventory and since its launch 2 years ago, it has grown at 130% YoY. It is tracking to $80 million in FY'21 revenue, 50% growth in daily revenue run rate year to date.

**Dify :** Opera acquired 2 small companies in 2020 - Pocosys and Fjord bank and used Pocosys to build a new fintech product called Dify which was launched in Spain in Feb '21. Initially Dify will provide an integrated mobile wallet, Debit Card and Cashback for its users with plans to launch additional services like BNPL/Credit and fractionalized share investing to its 50M active users in Europe.

**Opera Gaming :** Early 2021, Opera acquired leading 2D gaming engine company, YoYo Games and launched a Gaming division combining it with its gaming focused browser Opera GX, which has grown quite rapidly to 10M active users since its launch in June 2019. Opera plans to build a gaming community around these 10M+ users and its thousands of GameMaker developers and has plans to launch a steam like service --Gamebox-- to offer gaming publishers a platform to monetize their games.

**Business Model**

* **Search revenue :** Opera primarily makes money from its 80 million desktop MAUs when they conduct searches from its search bar.  Opera has revenue sharing contracts with Google and Yandex.
* **Advertising revenue :**  Opera makes advertising revenue 2 ways:
   * Revenue shares from book marked link, speed dials and other forms of affiliate advertising on its browser. Each million Opera GX users bring $2.8M in yearly revenue and Opera is in early innings of monetizing this gaming user base.
   * Native advertising in its Opera News App, growing at 160% YoY.
* **Other revenue :** This low margin revenue comes from providing professional services to Opay. This is being phased out completely by FY'21 as Opay has scaled its operation with its own staff.

**Financials**

Opera Search and Advertising revenue have grown at \~22% CAGR, from $33.5M in Q2' 18 to $60.2M in Q2' 21. This revenue comes at \~95% gross margin and has AEBITDA margin profile of 20-30%. Opera has been investing for growth so it's AEBITDA margin have fluctuated from 0% to 41% since its IPO.

Opera has forecasted FY' 21 revenue of $242-247M , 48% growth over FY ‘20. It has forecasted FY ‘21 AEBITDA of $10-20M, despite its stated objective of investing up to $100M into scaling its fintech initiative, Dify in FY' 21 and investing for growth in Opera News, Dify and Opera Gaming.

With covid recovery, momentum in its advertising business, over 10% browser growth in EU, and ramp up of Opera News App in US and Europe, Opera has projected to grow its search and advertising revenue at 25% YoY for next several years.

Opera has always taken a very conservative approach with its forecast and has not assumed any significant contributions from its Fintech(Dify) and Gaming(YoYo Games) initiatives in its FY '21 guidance. Assuming moderate success from these initiatives where Opera is investing over $100M, Opera should easily grow at upwards of 30% YoY for the next several years and reach around $500M revenue in FY ‘23 at 25%+ AEBITDA margins.

**Opera's Minority Stake**

* **Opay -** Opay is leading mobile money wallet in Nigeria and has expanded to Egypt in early '21. In 2019, Opay raised $170M at a valuation of $500M in external funding from Softbank, Meituan and was doing $300M in transaction processing volume(TPV) per month. Since then it has grown to over 10 million MAUs. In 2020, Opay TPV/month grew 4.5 times -- from $450M in Jan to $2B in December. Most recently in June'21, Opay raised $400M at a $2B valuation. Opera also monetized 29% of its preferred share stake for $50M and has left around 8% of stake to participate in future growth of Opay.
* **Starmaker -** Starmaker app, which has an installed base of over 100 million users,  is a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists and is top 5 grossing music app in google play store in South East Asia, Middle East, South Asia and Europe.  When Opera invested $30M for a19.35% stake in Nov'18, it had a $17M run rate.  Since then it has been growing like a wildfire -- a CAGR of 157% in 2.5 years --  with YoY growth accelerating recently to 250% to  $180M Q1 '21 run rate and with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M Q4'20 run rate.
* **Nanobank -** Nanobank offers Micro lending and other financial services to the underbanked and underserved population in India, Indonesia, Kenya and Mexico via its mobile apps. Last year, Opera merged its micro lending operations in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank for a 42% stake. Nanobank collectively has over 50 million users of its mobile app and has recently expanded into Mexico with credit card features for its underbanked population. Nanobank was growing revenue at a CAGR of 295% pre covid - scaling from $22M Q1 '19 revenue at 24% AEBITDA margin to $92M  Q4 '19 revenue at 41% AEBITDA margin. It has not yet completely recovered from covid in its largest market India and had $57M Q1 ‘21 revenue at 3% AEBITDA margin. Opera has stated that, with the expansion of Nanobank in Mexico and other Latin American countries, they expect Nanobank to come to pre covid quarterly revenue run rate of $120M at 30%+ AEBITDA margin next year.

**Opera SUM-OF-PART valuation**

1. **Conservative/Bear Case**

Starmaker announced 3x growth in 2020 and $127m run rate at the end of Q4 ‘20. In Q1 ‘21, it has revenue run rate of $180M. I am using $45M as Q1 revenue and applying sequential growth of 25%, 15% and 5% to get to Q4 revenue of $68M.  Using arithmetic series sum over $45M Q1 ‘21 revenue and $68M Q4 ‘21 revenue gives 2021 revenue of $226m \[ 4\*(45+68)/2 \]

Opay does not report revenue run rate but TPV. Since Opay reported 4.5x TPV growth in 2020, TPV grew from $445M in January 2020 to $2B in December 2020. I am taking arithmetic series sum to get the total TPV of $14.7B for 2020 \[12 \* (445 + 2000)/2 \] . Although Opera did not reveal the TPV for March 2021, they stated that the TPV is growing nicely. Along with additional product launches in additional countries, I am projecting 2x growth in TPV in 2021(a deceleration from 4.5x growth in 2020), with a TPV of $2B for Jan 2021 and $4B for Dec 2021. Taking the arithmetic series sum gives an expected 2021 TPV of $36B. I have looked at airtel Mobile Money and M-pesa revenue to TPV ratio ( 0.008 for airtel and 0.006 for M-pesa). Applying the average of 0.007 revenue to TPV ratio, gives Opay 2020 revenue of $103M and 2021 revenue of $252M. Currently Opay services are heavily discounted so their take rate is much lower than more established players like airtel and M-Pesa. Opay reported 2020 revenue of $69M and I am forecasting $21M as Q1 ‘21 revenue and applying 20% sequential growth rate through FY ‘21 gives Q4 ‘21 revenue of $37M. Using Arithmetic series sum, gives forecasted FY ‘21 revenue of $116M.

Before we do the sum of the part valuation of Opera, let's look at comparable companies :

* Upstart holding(UPST), which is growing 200% YoY in FY ‘21,  is trading at 20x revenue multiple. It has a lower margin profile than Nanobank though . However, I am using only 6x multiple for Nanobank since it is projected to grow revenue at 29% compared to 100% for UPST. Nanobank is expected to achieve pre covid revenue run rate of $120M in Q1 ‘22 and as per my estimate, it should grow more than 100% YoY in FY’22.
* Pinterest and Snap commanded a 50-70x revenue multiple during their 150% growth phase. I am using 8x multiple for starmaker.
* Klarna, AfterPay, Square commanded 30-40x revenue multiple during 200+% revenue growth, I am using 8x revenue multiple for Opay

**📷**

The above sum of part analysis is done using a super conservative valuation just to highlight the massive disconnect in market valuation of Opera’s stock price. Opera and all its minority stakes are in hyper growth mode, and if one were to apply growth multiples, it can easily more than double this conservative sum-of-part valuation.

1. **Base Case**

The base case assumes the market will give Opera’s high gross margin(\~95%) and 25-30% AEBITDA business, a higher multiple with a revenue forecasted to grow at 25% for next several years and valuing Opay and Starmaker which are growing upwards of 150% YoY a 30 to 40 multiple which similar companies have commanded during their hyper growth phase.

1. **Bull Case**

As if Opera is not undervalued enough, Opera also has 2 new growth initiatives which could offer \*significant\* additional upside to base case.

* Opera has ambitious growth plans with a new fintech initiative, called Dify, in Europe. What I like is the tight coupling of Cashback/Coupons/Payment/CryptoWallet in the browser. Imagine 10% of 50M users of opera browser in Europe use dify, and spend an average of $500/year, Opera could get $2.5B/year of transactions/payment through them. If average cashback is 5% of transaction amount and Opera’s take rate is 30%, dify’s revenue will be $38M/year. Although too soon, if Opera’s is successful in getting 10% of its browser users in Europe to use Dify or gain additional browser users due to popularity of Dify and launch additional product like BNPL, one could argue that Dify, in itself, can grow into $1-2B business in next couple of years. You can see how Klarna, Afterpay are valued in private/public valuations today. For comparison, think Honey, which Paypal bought in 2018 for $4B dollars, for 14 million users generating $100M of revenue and the Cashback aspect of Dify is just one part of the overall Dify value proposition.
* Opera also recently bought YoYo Games, makers of the popular indie 2D game engine, game maker. Time will tell if they can compete against powerhouses like Unity or Roblox, but you have to give the benefit of doubt to Yahui Zhou, the 60% owner of Opera. He has a knack for identifying boring assets and turning them into growth engines. Who would have thought that the Opera Browser business, which he bought for $600M, can launch many new and exciting businesses and also grow its core with differentiated offerings. We just need to wait and see what the future brings for this.
* Opera also bought a bank in Europe, Fjord Bank. They have not shared their plans on what they are going to do here, but if they have ambition to be neobank like N26 or revolut, Opera can quickly scale this neobank given its large user base. They can offer investment services once they reach critical mass as part of this fintech offering.

Assuming Dify and Gaming takes off, I do expect significant revenue expansion of Opera Core from $250M-260M in FY ‘21(55% YoY growth), to $360-380M in FY ‘22( 45% YoY growth), and to $480-520M in 2023(26% YoY). This growth would be at 20-30% AEBITDA margin. This type of growth commands a revenue multiple of 20+.

**Catalyst**

* Continued momentum in Opera Ads, improved monetization of Opera News in US and Europe can provide upside to conservative FY '21 guidance of $245M by $10-$15M
* Scale out of its fintech initiative Dify to Germany and France to its 50 million MAUs in Europe at low CAC will yield additional revenue upside. Paypal bought Honey for $4B for its 14 million users generating $100M in annual revenue in 2018. If Opera can convert 10-15% of its 50 million users to its Dify/Cashback product, It can contribute $50M+ of incremental revenue in FY '22.
* Continued growth in its minority stakes - Nanobank, Starmaker and OPay will provide additional upside to already low valuation.
* A funding event/IPO of Nanobank and Starmaker can further unlock value of its minority stakes.
* Continued momentum in Opera GX along with launch of Gamebox service will bring a viral effect and can help Opera double its Opera GX MAUs from 10 million to 20 million by early next year, bringing in additional $30M of FY'22 revenue.
* A potential partnership with Oprah, and marketing Opera as Oprah's browser could bring in visibility and brand awareness in the US and can help Opera gain additional 10+ million users of its product in the US)
* Continued scrutiny and regulation of big tech in the US and Europe is positive for smaller players like Opera.
* Once Opera gets institution visibility, I think it can easily trade into $50+ after getting growth multiple.

**Short Report**

Opera was the target of [Hindenburg short report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/opera-phantom-of-the-turnaround/) back in Jan 2020. more than 18 months have passed since then, time has proven that short thesis wrong. With the benefit of time on my side, following is the rebuttal to that short report.

**Conclusion**

Overall, I think risk-reward weigh heavily on Opera long side and offer significant upside opportunity to patient investors.

2021-05-27,Why Shorting Support.com (SPRT) Might be a Bad Idea,"Why Shorting Support.com (SPRT) Might be a Bad Idea Disclaimers:

* I own shares of Support.com.
* If Support.com's share price goes up high enough, I might sell my position.

**TL;DR**: Even though Support.com (SPRT) might not have the greatest business model out there today, and even though its latest adventure into the crypto currency world is speculative, shorting the stock might be a very bad idea for many reasons, including a great team, high insider ownership, a strong balance sheet, and low liquidity.

Starting off with a brief history of Support.com might sound boring at first, but let me show you that it is quite important in this case. Support.com was founded in 1997, with one of its founders being Marc Pincus. If that name doesn't ring a bell yet, let me help you out: he's the guy that later brought us hours of joy with FarmVille, that Facebook game that got hugely successful, as he was also the founder of Zynga in 2007. Back then, one of Support.com's early investors was SoftBank, and its initial goals were quite ambitious: they wanted to create self-healing software. Please don't ask me what that is, but to me it sounds rather high-tech and artifical-intelligency. 

The first few years looked bright, at least from a valuation point of view: the company went public in 2000 at a $1.5bn valuation. Fast forward to today: the company has a market cap of roughly $60m and its ambitious initial focus have faded since. Today, the company basically offers phone support services to enterprise customers. And with customers I mean: two customers. At this point, you might say: this actually does sound like an awful company, why the heck shouldn't I short it?

Let me tell you why.

Support.com has $46m of current assets and total liabilities of $7m. If you completely disregard any value of its non-current assets (which you very well might), one could imagine that Support.com would be able liquidate its business, pay back all of its creditors, pay out the remaining cash to the shareholders and close up shop. As there are roughly 24m shares outstanding, this case would give you about $1.63 per share. The biggest fear for me would be that, for whatever reason, the company does not actually have the current assets. But I have no reason to believe that, actually, I have evidence to believe the opposite. Support.com paid a special dividend of $1.00 at the end of 2019, and I can confirm that I received that dividend. Fully paid and well on time. They actually did have the cash and distributed it nicely to their shareholders. You might be interested to hear that the share price before the special dividend was announced was at around $1.90 per share. A stock that can be bought at $1.90 paying a $1.00 (special) dividend is rather extraordinary, right? So what happened?

In 2016, Support.com reported a net loss of $27m for fiscal year 2015. They somehow managed to have that huge loss while only having revenues of $77m. At the time, the company has been living off of its cash reserves for years, burning through the money that it still had from the successful IPO many years prior. Their products were bad, their business was bad. At that time, however, a group of investors wanted to make some changes. In June 2016, they staged a coup and replaced the entire Board of Directors of the company with their own picks. They installed a new CEO, Rick Bloom, and set out to improve things. Lingering legal cases (a relic from previous management) had to be resolved, cost and profitability needed to be addressed. And they did a terrific job: Only two years later, in fiscal 2018, they were profitable. Or more accurately: they would have been if they didn't have to pay a $10m fine to resolve the legal issues they inherited from previous management.

In the years thereafter, Support.com set out to transform and improve their business, which turned out to be rather difficult. Support.com was operating on a break-even level, but had a tough time growing and getting more profitable. The company tried to gain new customers, as almost all of its revenues came from two customers only, and one of those customers was winding down their business with Support.com steadily. Revenues went down from $77m in 2015 to $44m in 2020. It looks like Support.com was mostly getting rid of unprofitable business, as their margins have been steadily increasing (their gross profit was higher in 2020 than in 2015!), but they did not seem to get new profitable business. I think it is for that reason that last year, the company decided to hire a new CEO. Often in these cases, the old CEO is fired, but not in our case. The old CEO (Rick Bloom) was not ousted - he still remains one of the largest shareholders of Support.com and sits on its Board of Directors. It much rather seems to me that Mr. Bloom decided that he wasn't the right guy to do this job any more - he was great in bringing the cost down, but he did not quite succeed in transforming the business and bringing in new revenue, so he decided to look for a better man (or woman!) for the job. And, oh boy, what a better (in this case) man for the job he found.

The new guy's name is Lance Rosenzweig, and he is a outsourcing and support industry veteran. Lance himself founded a different support company in 1998, namely PeopleSupport Inc. As a CEO and founder, he grew the company to $150m dollars in revenue, brought it public, got it to a market cap of more than $500m and then successfully sold it to a competitor. After he sold his company, he stayed in the outsourcing industry and was, among others, the CEO of an outsourcing company named Startek, where he grew revenues to $650m and dramatically grew EBITDA.

My first thought, when Lance took over in 2020 was: Why would an accomplished entrepreneur and manager, who managed companies ten times its size, come and be the CEO of this small and seemingly declining company? It certainly wasn't just for the money. He was already a wealthy man, having made millions with PeopleSupport and at his previous positions. At Support.com, he got a yearly salary of $480'000: not bad, but also not actually astronomical for a CEO of a public company. He got a nice options package, though, in case he managed to increase shareholder value. My best guess, why Lance took over the job is this: He was bored, liked the challenge, and saw lots of potential. Soon after he took over, he hit the ground running and put together his ""dream team"": He hired a new Chief Financial Officer, a new Chief Operating Officer, a new Chief Information Officer, and a new Chief Legal Officer. What really caught my eye was the fact that Lance worked with almost all of them at previous companies already.

So here we have an extraordinarily well fitting manager who has proven his skills in the past for way larger companies in exactly the same industry, and he decides to work for this small, rather obscure, seemingly declining company for (relatively) little pay. Additionally, he convinces his previous colleagues to quit their jobs and work with him on this project instead. For me, this shows that he sees potential in Support.com, and he had no bad feelings about asking his previous team to work with him again - and all of them (all industry veterans as well!) agreed!

From all of the above, I see Support.com rather as a startup, than an old, obsolete company. It has put together an all-star team, it has a huge amount of cash, and it even has revenues and is basically break-even at this point. For a startup like this, professional investors are often pay way more than what this company is currently selling for. With its strong balance sheet, the share even has a theoretical bottom at $1.63. Generally, at the current share price, one gets a lot of upside and only a little bit of downside.

But that's not all!

If you take a look at Support.com's price chart, you will see that something big happened on March 21 of this year. The price went from $2.14 from the previous close to a high of $9.45. It more than quadrupled. The volume was also incredibly high: While in the previous days, usually less then 100'000 shares were traded on a given day, on March 21 the volume was over 280m shares traded. For reference: Support.com only has 24m shares outstanding.

So what happened on March 21st? Basically, there was a merger announcement: Greenidge Generation Holdings, Inc., a New York based Bitcoin mining company that owns its own natural gas powered power plant and Support.com announced a plan that the two companies would like to merge. The market went crazy over those news and pushed the share price of Support.com to new highs. The general details of the deal are, that the shareholders of Support.com will own about 7.7% of the resulting, merged company. So the current Support.com and Greenidge Generation Holdings would put each of their business into a new company, and the current shareholders of Support.com would own 7.7% of this new business. The exact numbers will only be calculated at the time when (and if) the merger is actually happening, but roughly speaking, if you hold one share of Support.com now, you will get 0.124 shares of the new company, whose ticker symbol is going to be GREE, and you won't own any Support.com shares any longer. I have seen some people being confused about this, so I would like to make one point clear: after the merger, there will be no more Support.com shares, only Greenidge shares. So if you own let's say 800 shares of Support.com today, you will, after the merger, have about 99 (800 x 0.124) shares of Greenidge. Mathematically speaking, the share price of the new company (GREE) should be roughly eight times higher then the share price of Support.com at the closing of the merger, so you don't gain or lose any money just because of the merger closing. Of course the share prices can move, and the markets can behave irrationally, but generally speaking, this should be expected. So if you own 800 shares of Support.com and their price is let's say at $5.00 before the merger happening, that package is worth $4'000. After the merger, you will have 99 shares of Greenidge, and their price should be roughly $40.32 each, so you would still have $4'000. By the way - none of this post is financial advice, I just want to warn people that shorting Support.com might be dangerous.

Regarding the merger deal, I am not quite sure what to think. I have no opinion on Bitcoin mining or crypto currencies, and I don't know what the future will hold for that industry. In the merger presentation, however, Greenidge kind of implied that they are better and cooler than two of its main competitors, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA). Greenidge also already has submitted a so called [Form S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844971/000119312521149057/d166032ds4.htm) to the SEC, in which one can look up how the merger proposal came to be. It's a very interesting read, I can recommend it! In the merger negotiations between Support.com and Greenidge, there are also mentions of RIOT and MARA, and Greenidge (and some financial advisors) used those two companies to come up with a valuation for Greenidge as well. The market cap of RIOT today is $2.3bn, the market cap of MARA is $2.5bn. If we assume that Greenidge's value is also in that ballpark (I understand that some people might say that Greenidge is worth less, others might argue that Greenidge is worth more), let's say $2.4bn, and we just take Support.com's current market value, which is about $70m, then the combined company should be worth roughly $2.5bn. The new company will have about 39m shares, so the expected share price for the new company at that valuation would be $64.14. Based on that value, the fair price of Support.com should be $7.95 ($64.14 * 0.124). Today, it is at $2.85. I think it is rather undervalued.

Of course, one can argue about many of my assumptions and arguments, but I generally come to the conclusion that there is limited downside for Support.com's stock, but a pretty nice upside, and shorting the stock now might be very dangerous. Actually, there are four more points that make shorting Support.com even more risky:

1. Downward pressure on the price is limited. There are hardly any stocks to short out there anyhow, and I can't imagine where any more downward pressure on the price might come from. If you check out the [shares available for shorting](https://www.shortablestocks.com/?sprt), you'll see that one currently can only short about 100'000 shares. In the past couple of days, that number was even lower and at times there were no shares to short at all. This kind of implies, that everyone, who could short, has shorted already, so if you're holding a short position, you can't expect further downward pressure on the stock's price from additional shorters, because there are just no more shares to short. On the contrary: the people, who currently hold the shares of Support.com, have either bought them recently at rather low prices below $3.00, or have been holding for quite a long time (like me). They have gone through the price decline from $9.45 at the time of the merger announcement to $5.00, to $4.00, to $3.00, to $2.84 now. If they didn't sell at $5.00, or at $3.00 - why would they sell now at even lower prices? Especially if they might have the same thoughts that I lined out above.

2. The merger is not done yet, and the terms of the deal might even improve for Support.com shareholders. Support.com's shareholders still have to vote on the merger, basically saying whether or not they want the deal to happen or not. At some point (soon), a special meeting will be held at Support.com and the shareholders will have to vote for or against the merger. The merger can only happen when a majority of the shareholders approve the merger. This situation, that the special meeting has not been held yet, has two advantages from my point of view: First, Support.com's shareholders are protected against crazy downward movements or legal actions until the vote is done. What I mean is: if Bitcoin's price fell to 0 tomorrow, and Bitcoin mining would be rather useless as a result, and Greenidge's value would be zero, then Support.com's shareholders could still vote against the deal and continue as before. The same goes for a situation where the state of New York or the U.S. government bans Bitcoin mining and problems like that. But for all I know, Bitcoin's price could go to $1m, and I also kind of doubt that Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin are banned any time soon... Basically, all I see again is: limited downside, big upside. Actually, one more thing to consider regarding the merger is this: The terms of the deal have been negotiated back in January, February, and March of this year. Support.com and Greenidge agreed on the proposed terms on March 19th. On that date, RIOT's share price was at $60, MARA's share price was at $43. Now they are at $28 and $26, respectively. Now this might be wishful thinking, and is rather speculative, but I think there is a good chance that Greenidge might improve their offer to Support.com's shareholders. As I see it, Greenidge wants to become a public company. They have put in a lot of time and effort of making that happen - and the current market is, albeit a bit less favorable as in March of this year, still pretty nice for a public listing. So it's in their interest to make the merger happen - and for that, they might need to convince Support.com's shareholders, that the merger is a good deal for them. However, the deal's terms were negotiated in March, when the other crypto mining's companies shares were trading at double the price of today - Support.com's shareholders might have a problem with that. Greenidge could easily counter this by improving their offer, for instance by giving Support.com's shareholders a bigger piece of the merged company, for instance.
 
3. Liquidity is very low. In the last couple of days, the daily volume for Support.com's shares was around 500'000 shares a day. That's a dollar volume of less than $1'500'000. And not just that - it does not take much to make the price move. Just yesterday, for instance, it looks like there was a buyer for 100'000 shares at around 3:20 pm (NY time) and that moved the price $2.68 to $2.88. So with only $280'000, the price increased by more than 7%. I think this is a result of very few people selling, many people holding, and a huge insider ownership that is also holding. I don't want to imagine what happens to people who have a short position in this stock when suddenly good news and bigger volume comes in. I kind of think that a perfect storm might be forming here.

4. Insider ownership is huge, float is small, and short interest is very high. If you make a stock screener on [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/new), and filter for stocks that are in the United States, have a short percentage of float of larger than 33%, insider holding percentage of larger than 25%, and institutional holding percentage of larger than 50%, only two stocks (of 17'252 securities in the US, according to yahoo finance) come up. One of them is Support.com. Insiders are holding a large position, and they have been holding it for a long time. Take Rick Bloom, the former CEO, now a Director, for instance: he owns more than 1.3 million shares. Interesting tidbit: He bought more than 700'000 shares in the open market back in 2019 after the special dividend was announced with his own money. A big bulk of his holding is not from receiving shares as a CEO and a Director for free, but he put his money where his mouth was. Bradley Radoff, another director of the company, holds more than 1.7m shares. They have not sold a single share since the announcement of the merger proposal - they would have had to report any activity like that on a Form 4 at the SEC. I have seen some people suggest that Support.com was a pump-and-dump scheme back in March. I can't agree with that. First of all, there was no real ""pump"", they just announced the merger agreement, which they are legally required to do. And all the holders of the company are still holding all of their shares, so no dumping, either.

Maybe, as a last point: Support.com was not very, let's say ""active"" with their communications towards investors. There were no conference calls to discuss the quarterly earnings, hardly any interview, no investor presentations... They focused on turning the company around and getting the operation in shape, and I think they have done a terrific job. If you now consider that it's in both of the companies interest to ramp that activity up, and usually that is the case around an IPO (or in this case a listing through a merger), and if you combine that with all of my points from above, I think a perfect storm might be brewing here. And I think that shorting Support.com's stock now might be a very bad idea.",-0.5304669737815857,Negative,English
2021-04-30,ASML - When does a monopoly become too expensive?,"ASML - When does a monopoly become too expensive? **Introduction**

I currently hold shares in ASML, I’m very optimistic about the company’s future but I am concerned that the sentiment around semiconductor shortages has driven up their market cap beyond that justified by their future earning potential. 

I’ve updated my DCF to try and find support for the current valuation. In some cases I think I've been overly optimistic in an attempt to justify the current price, but it’s quite a stretch to do so.

I’m trying to justify holding this stock so any feedback is appreciated. If you are still bullish please let me know which assumptions are invalid, where I have been overly conservative or any mistakes.

**Assumptions**

These assumptions are largely based on ASML’s 2018 report (link at the bottom) for which they will be giving an update on their investor day (Sept 29th). Given the changes in the semiconductor sector between 2018 and now it’s possible this is slightly conservative now, so in some cases I have inflated these values.

I have estimated installed base mgmt income will continue to grow at \~5% on average per year.

I have estimated system prices based on the current average NXE:3400 unit cost and estimated the future models price reflects the improvement in performance (\~15-20% for 3600 and \~70% for a EXE:5000). I haven’t modelled the 3800 as this is unknown, but perhaps that could see an additional 10% increase in ticket price.

I haven’t discounted these prices in future as I believe robust demand coupled with lack of competition will enable ASML to maintain prices.

**System Sales**

I’ve very crudely modelled unit sales based on ASML’s 2018 report as well as previous production ramps (e.g. that High-NA EUV will ramp similarly to EUV, although slightly less aggressively due to the constraints on the Zeiss side). I’ve projected a continued decline in DUV immersion sales and a significant ramp in EUV. I haven’t really bothered modelling dry DUV units and just put a flat 2000.

&#x200B;

These sales numbers align fairly well with my expectations of Samsung, TSMC and Intel’s significant capex projected up to 2025. This would see ASML taking \~$60bn logic sales up to 2025 of their committed \~$200bn capex, which seems close to their recent spends \~30-35% going to ASML.

**Financials**

Based on the unit sales and assumptions above I’ve modelled earnings below. I have modelled a gradual increase in gross margin from the current 50% up to 55% in 2025 to reflect the high demand and shifting product mix towards EUV.

These align fairly well with the upper end of ASML’s 2018 estimate for 2025 sales (14-25bn), which I am confident they will hit given the extreme demand and their near-perfect execution to date.

**Valuation**

I’ve modelled the intrinsic value of ASML in 4 different ways. Using 2025-terminal earnings (which I am relatively confident in and 2030-terminal earnings, which I have much less confidence in. For each I have modelled using a perpetual growth rate of 2% or an exit P/E of 25.

I’ve used a fairly generous discount rate of 6% as I believe ASML to be highly reliable and relatively low risk. I also think current low interest rates and low equity risk premium justify a lower discount rate.

https://preview.redd.it/y46ir3aziaw61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=7336882f59001ac72fd3a7ef5e9ba61d62b00c9e

All of these models put ASML’s intrinsic value below current market cap. To change my assumptions to get closer the current market cap requires one of a few things:

**Significant growth in system sales** \- this feels somewhat unlikely, I don’t think they will have capacity for this and are constrained by Zeiss on the optics.

**Significant growth in system prices** \- perhaps in the short term if Intel/TSMC/Samsung are all desperate to get EUV capacity, but that seems unlikely to persist.

**Increased perpetual growth rate** \- This is probably the biggest unknown and the potential for the greatest value. There isn’t a roadmap beyond high-NA (except increasing beyond NA=0.55) but ASML seems best equipped to lead whatever comes next in lithography.

**Conclusion**

These models suggest ASML is currently overbought, which feels like a strong possibility given the amount of hype around semiconductors in general and the huge amount of capex planned by the EUV foundries.

If this current market elation is part of a continued growth trend for significant semiconductor demand and corresponding capex then perhaps my model is too conservative.

If however this is just a cyclical uptick and the semiconductor foundries will experience a period of digestion once supply constraints are met then perhaps ASML is indeed overbought.

[https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-services/semiconductor-advisors/298365-its-not-a-semiconductor-shortage-its-demand-delirium-poor-planning/](https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-services/semiconductor-advisors/298365-its-not-a-semiconductor-shortage-its-demand-delirium-poor-planning/)

The biggest unknown in my mind is beyond 2030. If we really don’t find a way past current lithography/silicon limits then what does that mean for ASML and its customers. EUV has perhaps one more swing with some higher NA (\~0.75) solution but then we hit physical constraints (in lithography and silicon) - it’s hard to know what position this puts ASML in.

**Discussion**

* What happens beyond 0.55 NA, will we see ‘higher-NA’, I know higher values have been considered but come with a whole host of challenges, but what comes after that?
* Will competition for EUV capacity between Intel, Samsung, TSMC in the coming \~2-3 years increase prices?
* Will restrictions on EUV sales to China ease, further increasing demand?
* Will China attempt to copy EUV, eroding ASML’s monopoly?

I’d like an excuse to hold this stock because ASML is the gatekeeper to almost all significant trends (AI/ML, computer-vision, autonomous driving, IoT, drones, Blockchain/Crypto, cloud), however I think the current price represents overexuberance for semiconductors in general and ASML specifically.

I’d be surprised if there wasn’t a better entry point by 2025 as supply constraints on semiconductors ease and foundry capex declines and it seems unlikely ASML earnings will grow quick enough to justify the current price.

2021-04-28,Enjoy Technology Going Public,"Enjoy Technology Going Public **Enjoy** (founded by Ron Johnson who helped setup Apple's retail business) is going public in a merger with Marquee Raine Acquisition Corp. (**$MRAC**). Very intrigued by their concept of the **mobile store**. They essentially have relationships with vendors like T/AAPL etc. and when a customer orders a product on the partner site, Enjoy delivers it to their home. But instead of just being a delivery service they provide the complete setup and support needed and can also sell select accessories.

I can see how this can be very attractive for less-tech savvy people who struggle with all the gadgets and making them work together.  Even otherwise, this may be a good service, depending on cost to customer, if they can provide convenience and save people from standing in line at at a T-Mobile or Verizon store.

I'm guessing Geek Squad does something similar but not sure about it. Competitive advantage here will come from being a first mover and having superb customer experience both of which they seem to be delivering on (see chart below).

Very interested to hear if anyone has had personal experience with Enjoy. I'll be following this closely as I think this is a very interesting relatively early stage concept.

Hi everyone! I'm new to this subreddit (although I've been reading a few things here for the last few months). Recently I've analyzed an interesting small-cap company by the name of Greenlane Renewables. It's a curious case but I'm not sure what to make out of it. I would really appreciate some feedback for both my analyses and for the company in question. Hope I can provide some value!

# Industry Overview

The biogas is released into the atmosphere with the decomposition of organic waste. This biogas (40-60% of methane and 60-40% of carbon dioxide and other gases) is generated by the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter can be turned into biomethane (95%+ methane) that can be used as a substitute for natural gas. This means that it prevents the release of methane (one of the greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere as well as CO2 making a carbon-neutral loop or even a carbon-negative loop. A big plus for this technology is that it uses the already available infrastructure to distribute gas, making it more viable economically.

This is not all perfect since the combustion of this gas is still pollution. This raises the question of how much this investment is worth it since the technology can be considered ""polluting"" in a decade. The risk of such a scenario is reduced since there is no way to reduce the pollution from farms, wastewater, and landfills, making it the only viable solution.

The main driver of this business is the regulatory changes that encourage this technology. The de-carbonization is one of the main drivers of this business since it is very difficult to actually reduce the emissions of CO2 in areas such as farms and landfills.

[The industry is projected to grow at around 15-20&#37; per year. ](https://preview.redd.it/u0du9u2o1pc61.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4c727d1cecea9d8d35a0063a4cfb169f05de1b1)

# Business Description

The business operates in the Renewable Natural Gas sector. It designs, overlooks the production, installs, and services a range of biogas upgrading systems using its patented water wash technology as well as other proven industrial technologies.

The company uses an asset-light model, meaning they outsource all the production. In 2019, approximately 66% of the Greenlane Biogas Group’s suppliers were located in North America and approximately 31% were from suppliers in Europe. The exact suppliers and their weight to the company are not shown.

They use all 3 technologies to process the biogas: water wash (the main one); pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and membrane. This is one of the ways that they differentiate themselves since no one else offers all 3 technologies.

As mentioned before their main technology is water wash. It has a low amount of units installed and yet it is the second biggest technology when it comes to the overall installed capacity.

[Number os Units Installed](https://preview.redd.it/uisrr7tu1pc61.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=018cebfe89f25969b6c34136fc0f3be3dbbcb6ce)

&#x200B;

[Total Capacity](https://preview.redd.it/nf2txszv1pc61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=81358a056d14f4746ed37862bcdeaf86630fdf5f)

Companies' main assets are the people and the patterns that they have. This is both their advantage and disadvantage. On one side they can expand at a rapid pace since there are no assets limiting them and yet on the other hand these models present much risk since their business is focused on production.

# Company's History

The company was created in 1986 in New Zealand with a focus on designing and building heat exchangers and gas compression packages. In the 1990's they started to install the upgrading systems using water wash technology (their main technology).

In 2014 the company was acquired by Pressure Technologies and renamed to PT Biogas Holdings Limited.

By 2018, over 100 Greenlane Biogas branded biogas upgrading systems had been deployed into 18 countries.

In 2017 the company restructured, moving from three regionally managed units into one globally operated company headquartered in Vancouver, Canada by Brad Douville.

In 2019 the company acquired their business (then called PT Biogas Holdings Limited) from Pressure Technologies for £10.1million:

* £2.0 million in cash
* £2.0 million in Special Warrants at a deemed value of $0.20 per share. They were converted into 17,418,000 Common Shares and 8,709,000 Warrants on August 9, 2019
* £6.1 million in the form of a promissory note. It has a duration of 48 months and has an interest rate of 7%.
* The PT Intercompany Debt (debt contracted before the separation) was outstanding in the amount of $0.7 million and is being paid in 9 installments.

In 2019 company entered into Integrated Biogas Alliance (IBA) that promises to provide customers with fully integrated organic waste to renewable energy platform solutions. This may be advantageous since they do not make the anaerobic decomposition facilities as well as any other facility that creates biogas. Thus these kinds of partnerships are very important if they work as intended.

In 2020 company signed an agreement contract with SWEN Capital Partners to create JV Co. This is a project that will help reduce the upfront costs of RNG technology installation in Europe. In essence, the company will create Special Purpose Companies where SWEN is the majority owner. The equipment will be loaned to the client that will pay it off in a monthly installment. At the end of the payment, the client will be the owner of the equipment. This will reduce the need for the huge upfront cost (2+ million) and as a result, will increase the number of projects and clients (in theory).

# Management and Governance

https://preview.redd.it/c3hclthb2pc61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a76ed2f9b5fe9ab8e048abc3bf9a04872e7dc487

Recently they issued new stock in the amount of 10,600,000 common shares at $2,17. The purchaser can opt for an additional 15% (1,590,000 shares) after the deal. This gives them a lot of liquidity but at the same time dilutes the shares even more.

One of the most worrying things about this company is that its executives are being compensated with stock options. This deludes the stock and incentivizes them to grow the stock price and not the company itself.

https://preview.redd.it/8evvfpfm2pc61.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=09f4b7248a4d7e438461c159509ed480a38eb9fd

https://preview.redd.it/3cdrmn9n2pc61.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f7513501ea90a29e97c58279cad0e8584c0f38

The management cut down on the stock options compensation but raised a lot of the salaries. Since the company did not hire new personnel the salary rase is way too extreme. Something to keep an eye on in the future.

Management does own many shares in the company. It seems that they are keeping them after they are granted the options.

# Risk Factors

* The company has a limited amount of clients and thus the revenues are at risk. The acquisition of new clients is also a difficult and irregular task creating more volatility.
* The company relies fully on the suppliers for the manufacturing and installation of the buildings. There is no list of the suppliers and the only information that we have is that some parts are produced exclusively by 1 supplier putting the company in a difficult position if that supplier can no longer serve them. Long-term contracts can mitigate that risk and yet the company does not disclose any information about that either.
* Due to a large number of Warrants, the delusion of stocks is a guaranty.
* The company is still unprofitable and has some obligations, making it more difficult to expand its core business.

# Competitive Positioning

https://preview.redd.it/hyizpsvw2pc61.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed8cedf084b046fc017b2af32cc38bf758e1fbe5

The only reference that can be found of the competition is done by the company so we need to take this information with a grain of salt. They do have all 3 main ways of making biomethane and so they offer a bigger range to their customers, however, they do not produce the equipment themselves and thus there is always a risk when it comes to their margins and their overall competitiveness.

# Financial Analyses

In 3Q of 2020 the results were:

### Balance Sheet

https://preview.redd.it/601ml7u43pc61.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5a835f38b4ab2126b716ae509bb9ca78ba02a94

It is notable that most of their assets are actually goodwill and intangible items. If we take the goodwill out of the equation we will have total assets of 21,292,000$.

They do have a working capital deficit of 0,3million. This is mostly due to the promissory note that became a current liability.

Their debt is 1/4 of their assets and their debt to sales is (accounting for the last 9 months) 0,4.

However, they do seem to finance their expenditures and everything else with stock issuance. This may be fine for now due to high-interest rates for credit and yet later on this will need to change.

### Income Statement:

https://preview.redd.it/ri0rw0973pc61.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=da2296d361713f75eede57482075f246cc4b3c4c

Their revenues have grown by almost 300% for the 9 months of 2020 compared to 2019.

Their gross margin did not change and remained at 30%. Their operating margins are still negative and decreasing. This is likely due to more projects and no revenues due to how long the projects actually take.

As of September 30, 2020, they had a backlog of $43.8 million and a pipeline of $690 Million

The top 5 customers accounted for 11%, 11%, 12%, 19% and 22% of total revenue (75% in total)

The net income of 743,000$ is due to the reduction in debt to be paid in the promissory note. If not for that the company has a loss of approximately 1,000,000$

Most of the revenues come from the sales of their upgrading kits and yet a large part of their aftercare service is still not caught up to the rest. This can be due to the majority of the projects still being in the works but it can also be due to weak customer retention. They do not provide the numbers for that so we can only guess.

https://preview.redd.it/e849itab3pc61.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa613322639bf9ad79d25c47389b7fddc4f06e8b

The fact that there are no new projects in Europe this year is also strange. Their partnership with SWEN can be in jeopardy if they are not able to get new contracts in Europe. Most of the aftercare revenue comes from Europe with nice growth in the US and Canada.

### Cash Flow Statement:

https://preview.redd.it/qzz5in2g3pc61.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=699a15ed2b51f7a1f1951e1174c2181dafd01040

For now, most of their cash flow is coming from financing activities such as the issuance of stocks and warrants as well as from stock options and warrants exercised. They are on the path to profitability and yet they are still running negative on operations. CEO said that at $30 Million they can start being profitable. There is still a long road to that but almost $50 Million in backlog can be a great start.

# Valuation

At 2,66$ per share and at a share count of around 140,000,000 (after recent share offering, warrants, and compensation) the total market cap is 372,000,000$ and the Price/Sales (considering the sales as their backlog) is around 8. With more realistic sales of $9-10 Million per year, the Price/Sales is around 40.

# Conclusion

There is a lot of growth potential and yet their competitive positioning is something to keep an eye on. Most of the risk comes from their asset-light model that has to prove that it can work. It already has a high valuation for an unprofitable small-cap operation. Honestly, I'm not sure what to make out of it. Seems like a great opportunity and yet not sure how likely they are to take advantage of the market potential that they have.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-01-10,AFRM: Another Underpriced IPO Worth Looking At,"AFRM: Another Underpriced IPO Worth Looking At Hi r/securityanalysis, I am trying to become better at researching investment ideas and here is a piece I recently put together. I would love some feedback and a discussion on your thoughts on it. 

**The Situation and Company Background**

Affirm is a leading buy now, pay later (BNPL) provider that allows consumers to have the flexibility to pay for their purchase over a period of 6 weeks to 48 months with merchants that have added Affirm as a payment option. The company is expected to trade under the ticker “AFRM” and start trading next Wednesday with price talk around $38/share, which equates to an equity value of around $9.2B. This is a severely lower valuation than other fintech peers such as Afterpay, Square, and Shopify. We believe that AFRM should be valued at least $20B to $30B using a conservative FY23 EV/Sales total company comp of 13x compared to Afterpay at 18.3x, SHOP at 28.1x, and Visa and Mastercard around 16x. 

The company mainly operates in the United States, and as of September 30th, has already partnered with over 6,500 merchants and has 3.9M active consumers but recently acquired PayBright, a Canadian based BNPL provider. Affirm generates most of their revenue through fees charged to merchants when a customer uses the BNPL option at checkout. Additionally, the company generates revenue through simple interest charged to consumers that have chosen to extend their payment options beyond the interest-free payment length. Merchant fees range from 2 – 3% while APR ranges from 0 – 30%. Additionally, the company earns fees through customers who utilize a virtual debit card, gains on loans sold to third-party investors, and servicing fees on loans managed by Affirm. 

In FY20 (June end), Affirm saw +92.7% revenue growth to $509.5M, with $256.8M in merchant network revenue (50.4% of revenue) and $186.7M in interest income (36.6% of revenue). Additionally, active customers grew +76.9% to 3.62M active users and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew +77.0% to $4.6B. We note that Affirm is currently reliant on one merchant, Peloton (PTON) for their revenue as the partner accounted for 28% of FY20 revenue and the top 10 merchants accounted for 35% of revenue. 

**Investment Thesis**

We believe that Affirm will be the dominant BNPL provider in the future in the United States that will benefit from increasing usage of BNPL at checkout. We anticipate Affirm’s recent partnerships with e-commerce platform Shopify (SHOP) and payment company Adyen (ADYEN.AS) will help drive a flywheel effect to allow Affirm to establish itself as the dominant BNPL provider in the United States as both platforms will help bring additional merchants and consumers onto the platform. We expect the Shopify partnership to help capture a differentiated market that is underserved compared to competitors Afterpay and Klarna. With the addition of Shopify, hundreds of thousands of vendors can now add a BNPL option seamlessly which will allow Affirm take market share, which will further drive the flywheel effect. 

We also believe that Affirm provides a better product suite than competitors from the perspective of both the merchant and consumer. Affirm’s product provides more flexibility on payment term length compared to its competitors, offers virtual debit cards to allow consumers to use Affirm at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm, and a no fee and competitive high-yield savings account. Additionally, Affirm charges substantially lower merchant fees. Together, we believe merchants are more likely to choose Affirm when deciding on which BNPL company to implement, which will further compound the desirability of implementing Affirm as their consumer and merchant base grows.  

Finally, we anticipate Affirm to serve a Millennial, Gen Z, and Gen X population that has not adopted credit card usage like their older generations. Their generations are more accustomed to online shopping and utilizing digital payments but have built a distrust in traditional credit due to seeing their older friends and family negatively impacted during the 2008 financial crisis.

**Comparable Company Analysis and Valuation**

[Comp Sheet](https://imgur.com/CLgDfsK) Source: Factset, and [Valuation](https://imgur.com/UM5iiOS) indicate a fair value of $20B to $30B equity value compared to IPO pricing of around $9.2B. This is another severely underpriced IPO that is poised to pop on the first day of trading. 

**Buy Now Pay Later Background**
Affirm offers a new alternative way that people can transact. Consumers have been utilizing different methods to trade for goods and services since the dawn of man. Transactions have originally started through bartering for different items and goods and evolved into using coins made from precious metals as accepted methods of payment. In a more modern world, we have moved to utilizing paper currency and coinage, and more recently, into credit/debit and digital wallets. The way people shop has also significantly evolved throughout time. Gone are the days merchants carried their wares across different towns. Although we still have outdoor markets much like Greek agoras in 1,000 B.C., we have evolved in the way we pay for goods and services at markets. Local stores and department stores, which dominated the way consumers shopped in the 19th and 20th century, are in a decline. Now, we are entering a new period in how consumers shop; online. With this revolution, we can see continued shifts and advancement in the way people pay and we believe the “buy now pay later” option is the innovation that has the potential to upend the traditional credit/debit card market.

Affirm will become the second largest publicly traded BNPL provider, behind Australia’s Afterpay. The BNPL payment option is an alternative way for a consumer to pay for product by providing flexibility regarding payment terms and is a point-of-sale (POS) loan.  Although the BNPL payment method is still miniscule compared to traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, accounting for approximately 1% of e-comm sales in 2019, Worldpay’s 2020 Global Payments report expects penetration to increase 3x to 3% of e-comm sales utilizing BNPL by 2023. In EMEA, the payment method is already more established and accounted for 6% of 2019 e-comm payments and Worldpay expects it to reach ~10% penetration by 2023. Market research company eMarketer estimated that U.S. consumers spent $590B on e-comm in 2019. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the first 3 quarters of 2020 had 16.3% of retail sales ex-auto penetration through e-comm, compared to 12.5% in the same period LY, and e-comm dollars spent grew +34.2%. With the pandemic reshaping how consumers shop and accelerating the growth of e-comm sales usage and spending, we believe that BNPL usage could potentially beat Worldpay’s estimates. 

Another key piece for Affirm’s success relates to their credit risk model. Unlike a traditional credit card where a consumer is approved for a credit limit at the time of application, Affirm provides a credit limit in addition to analyzing risk at the transaction level and can approve/reject purchases at the time of purchase. The company’s risk model has allowed them to approve 20% more customers compared to other competitors while still limiting delinquency and default rates. Additionally, their 36-month delinquency rate is more than 50% lower than the credit card industry average of 2.5%, with a rate of 1.1%. We also estimate that AFRM’s net charge-off rates are also about 50% lower than industry average, ending FY20 with 1.8% of loans charged off compared to the credit card industry average of 3.7% in the same period. Although traditional credit card companies can lower a consumer’s credit limit at any point in time, they are often slow to react as their algorithms rely on antiquated methods such as credit scores, transaction history, and credit usage. This indicates credit card algorithms are utilizing data that could be older than a month to make credit risk decision. Affirm’s proprietary risk model has brought the credit risk model into modern times with real-time economic data in addition to SKU level data to assess risk more advantageously and at a transactional level.

**Why Affirm?**

Although Affirm is not the only BNPL provider in the U.S. and was not the first provider, we believe that Affirm’s product suite is superior compared to competitors such as Afterpay and Klarna. Currently, Afterpay only lets consumers split their purchase into 4 interest free payments split in 2-week intervals across 4 payments, spreading payments across 6-weeks. Klarna’s product is essentially identical. Affirm allows consumers to split their purchases monthly for up to 48 months, with most interest free periods ranging up to 12 months. Additionally, we believe Affirm is more compelling for the retailer to utilize because the merchant fees charged are substantially lower (2 – 3%) vs. Afterpay (3 – 6%) and Klarna (up to 5.99%). Affirm also offers a virtual debit card, which lets you use your Affirm account to pay at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm as their chosen BNPL provider.

**How Can Affirm Continue to Grow and Improve?**

Affirm is Still Missing Multiple Pieces to Become the Dominant BNPL Provider. Although we are bullish on Affirm’s long-term prospects and impressed with their current progress, we believe there is still room to improve. We believe two key components of a dominating alternative payment company are still missing, and once implemented, can accelerate new user adoption. (1) Affirm needs to implement a rewards program, similar to traditional credit cards and Klarna’s “Vibe” rewards program. Affirm highlighted most of their users have the ability to pay for their purchase in full but prefer the financial flexibility of splitting payments. We believe Affirm’s users are financially responsible consumers and may face hesitation to utilize the BNPL option vs. a credit card as there is no rewards/cash back offering at Affirm. We expect Affirm to offer a rewards program in the near future, which would impact profitability, but would help drive customer acquisition in the long-term. (2) A physical card that allows the user to utilize Affirm’s BNPL option in retail stores could help drive additional GMV growth. The card would be programmed to follow the merchant’s current agreement and timeframe of repayment that the merchant and Affirm have already agreed too. However, if the card is used at a non-partner merchant, AFRM would allow the card to be used as a 0% APR credit card with repayment term lengths determined by their proprietary credit risk model. Recall that a credit card was used to pay in 40% of in-store transactions, and we believe a physical card can help complete AFRM’s product suite. We also believe the card can help bring Affirm on equal footing with competitors that have partnered with substantially more merchants as consumers can use the Affirm card online with any merchant.

**The Bears**

Affirm is in a distant third place with 3.9M active users in the U.S. as of September 30, 2020, trailing Afterpay’s 6.5M active U.S. customers and Klarna’s 10M customers in the same period. Additionally, Affirm currently has 6.5k active U.S. merchant partnerships compared to Afterpay’s 13.9k U.S. partnerships and Klarna’s 235k+ global partners. Lastly, Affirm lags both competitors in GMV. Affirm saw $5.3B in TTM GMV compared to Afterpay’s $11.1B AUD and Klarna’s $35B+ USD from January to September 2020.  We do highlight that Affirm is the leader in average GMV/customer at $1,359 compared to Afterpay at $991 and Klarna at $412, which we believe is due to high exposure to PTON and other higher-AOV retailers.

Affirm is still heavily reliant on Peloton (PTON), but we believe they have a symbiotic relationship. PTON offers Affirm as an option to finance equipment at 0% APR for up to 39 months. Our field checks and PTON’s 10-K indicate that substantial portion of PTON equipment purchases are financed through AFRM. AFRM also disclosed that 28% of FY20 revenue came from their PTON partnership. A big critique of AFRM’s business model is that they are too reliant on one merchant for their revenue. We believe that this could pose a risk in the intermediate future, but analysts expect PTON’s performance through FY2021 (June 30-end) to remain strong. PTON recently reported an explosive 1Q (Sept-30 end) with +233% revenue growth but +281% growth in their connected fitness segment, which is the segment that recognizes sales of their Peloton Bike.

**Still Undervalued Excluding PTON**

**Valuation**

We use a blended valuation to arrive to a $94 implied value/share, which provides +147% upside to the high end of the IPO price talk of $33 to $38/share. Our valuation is based on a 75%/25% blend of a multiples-based analysis on FY2023E and a DCF model. Our EV/sales analysis assigns a 16x multiple on merchant network revenue, 12x multiple on interest income revenue, and a 2x multiple on servicing income, virtual card revenue, and gain on sale of loans. This provides a total company EV/sales multiple of 13x FY23 estimates. This is lower than APT’s 18.3x FY23 EV/sales multiple, which we believe is justified due to AFRM’s revenue mix that is more concentrated towards interest income revenue, lower GMV, fewer active customers, and high reliance on one merchant. However, AFRM is a fast-growing alternative payment company that is growing share in a fast-growing industry, has strong partnerships that we believe will help drive growth long-term, and a strong leadership team with successful experience in the internet/payment space. For DCF, we use a WACC of 10.9%.

2021-01-06,Special Situation: Yorkey Optical HK$2788,"Special Situation: Yorkey Optical HK$2788 **Yorkey Optical (HK:$2788)**

The main business of Yorkey is in the manufacturing and sales of plastic and metallic parts and components of Digital Still Cameras (DSCs), action cameras, copier-based multifunction peripherals, surveillance cameras, projectors and advanced TVs, etc.

The DSC market is a slowly dying business as mobile phones cameras become more advanced but Yorkey has managed to remain barely profitable with interest income mainly from property they own. The company derives a bulk of their revenues from Japan and the PRC. 

Yorkey’s latest interim report gives us reason to look at this stock. 

**Interim Report - Balance Sheet** **30/6/20 (All figures in USD$)**

**Non-current Assets**

Investment Properties: Acquired in 31 December 2016, Workshops 01-09. 26th Floor CRE Centre, bought for $6.3M. Unable to find any disclosed transactions at Cre centre and hence couldn’t get a gauge on whether they overpaid for this. 

However, let’s assume they overpaid and value this at = **$2.75M (50%)**

Property, Plant & Equipment: This is currently valued at US$5.1M on their balance sheet. As the DSC market is a slowly dying industry, let’s assume a worst case scenario and value their equipment at **$750K (15%).**

Deposits valued at balance sheet figures = **$390K**

**Total Non-current Assets = $4M**

**Current Assets**

Inventories ($2.7M) = Let’s assume their inventories are worthless and value it at **$270K (10%).** 

Trade and other Receivables ($7.76M) = **$6M(valued at 80%)**

Bank balances and cash = **$82M**

**Total Current Assets = $88M**

**Total Assets = $4M + $88M = $92M**

**Yorkey has no debt and total liabilities amount to** = **$20M** 

Thus, anyone can come along and pay **$56M** for a company with a book value of about **$72M in a worst case scenario** and get $16M for free. 

Let’s say in the past 3 months since the interim report was released, the company has suffered more losses in their business. I believe the difference between book value and market price provides a sufficient margin of safety as I have been fairly pessimistic in the valuation of the assets.

**Short Case:**

1. Market might know something I don’t, resulting in the low share price.
2. The numbers could have been fudged and the business is in worse condition. Management might be not be disclosing all information to shareholders. (This has happened before in 2013 but the old CEO and financial controller have been removed) 

**Catalysts:**

1. Yorkey Optical is a dying business, but the DSC market has slightly recovered and Yorkey’s business will recover over the coming years. I believe Yorkey will not go bankrupt anytime soon and will still be definitely be worth more than $56M. ([http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/dw-202011\_e.pdf](http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/dw-202011_e.pdf)) ([http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/d-202011\_e.pdf](http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/d-202011_e.pdf))
2. Management has also been buying back shares. 

**Additional points:**

David Webb, HK corp governance guru has also recently added US$35K to his current holdings. He is a 5% shareholder of the company since 2013 and has fought against the board for them to be more shareholder-friendly.

The past 3 times he has invested a similar amount to his positions, the stock has always revalued upwards in the following months.

Hello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.

My   name’s Mark and I’m an accountant with a passion for investing. About   two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm   and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and   privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique   perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a   new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to   help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market   today.

I’m a long-term investor. I   am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long  time.  I’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and  everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led  me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed.  If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the  book  “100 Baggers” by Chris Mayer.

**Introduction**

I’m   excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month,  Smartsheet.  I’m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock  screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth),  scan Twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to  observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends  and family. One  of the best investment decisions I’ve made to date came  after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf  course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you  never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.

In   the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock   screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B),  strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a  subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts,  it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet,  the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and  that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I’ve had as a  teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I’ve always found empowering people to  be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more  later in the  write up.

Another  positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I  was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was  watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of  Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word “Smartsheet” mentioned in  the video and  said “Are they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue  check mark?”. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were  thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it.  She said “My  company just transitioned all of our work onto  Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really  excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about  Smartsheet.

**The Thesis Statement**

For   every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement   that can serve as a reminder for why I’m buying and holding that stock   for the long term. I’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long   so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during  times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why   you’re holding this position.

The thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:

*“Smartsheet:   A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the  global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work,  managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally  consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that  tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the  most out of  their teams.”*

I  think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what  Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet’s website and look at the  “About” page, you will  find their “About” statement which says  “Smartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns  people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive  innovation, and achieve more.”  Notice how their statement emphasizes  helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.

In   my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM   software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable   independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM   space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise   capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of   customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the   companies that were identified from the study in the order of their   ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader   in the space at 2nd place. Let’s use our common sense for a second. At   the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest   in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with   resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage   work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the   answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies   on the list. Let’s break them down 1 by 1:

* Workfront   was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront,  you’d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn’t  be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.
* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)
* Wrike is private
* ServiceNow   – CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing   here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company  is  already quite large ($106B market cap)
* Asana   is public but just IPO’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don’t have   much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.   Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment  into  the CWM space, they’re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in   several of Forrester’s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you   can invest in the best?
* Monday.com is private
* Microsoft – CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.
* Atlassian   – This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple  problems  with them as an investment. 1) They’re ranked way beneath  Smartsheet.  2) They’re already too big for me to confidently say they  can 10x  (market cap already $58B).

Now   that we’ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space  and  that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play  investment  in this space let’s understand why this is important. Other  than the  obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote  work  revolution, why is this important?

Well,   let’s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO,  during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th,  2020:

“Leaders  are recognizing  they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is  documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities  are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams  with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times  will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and   prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is   ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive   the benefits from doing so.”

Key word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:

Asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.

Synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.

Any   communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be   considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.   Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real   time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As   part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by   the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and   Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in   2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is   called “The Power of Done”. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent   noticed through their own experience, and through different research   studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the   early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This   is a quote from their E-Book:

“According   to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,   interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging   and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized  basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.   workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.”

They   mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances  in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets,  there  hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for  teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology  advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also  deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred  to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it  and thus they  founded Smartsheet.

**How Smartsheet makes money**

At   the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand   how they make money. In Chris Mayers’ excellent book, 100 Baggers, that  I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth  as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This  isn’t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just  because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a  growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the  first things I  look at.

Before I  talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little  bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue.  Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate  world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However,  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not  necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get  more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have  Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all  employees of the company no  matter where they are with live  information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is  assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose  their way of viewing this information with  different views such as  calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.

The  idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous  information  available to all members of a team about the status of a  project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous  communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time  doing what  they’re hired to do – get work done. Think about how  wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him  spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and  hunting people down  to see where they’re at with their assignments.  What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and  his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other  and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing,  and producing?  That’s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.

For   Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I  mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company.  Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my  opinion that’s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model,  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of  reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as  an investor.

Smartsheet’s  primary  source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based  Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential  customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either  signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the   Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to   Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses   Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets   their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.

Smartsheet   offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and   Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.   Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration   and automation to third-party applications.

The   Connectors part of the business is something I find really  interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top  work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to  allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet  user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true “command  center”  platform while the products of the other companies become  ancillary  pieces. You’ll see this on the link above but some products  that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud,  Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype  just to name a  few.

I think that  being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the  Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot  of these  companies that people may perceive as “Smartsheet  competitors” actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can  be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral  angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to  their perceived “competitors”  reminds me a little bit of how Roku  (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on  their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies  like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be  integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition  in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their  customers if they didn’t allow for their  products to be integrated with  Smartsheet.

On  top of the  Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell,  Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal   plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can   sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired   10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource   allocation and planning. The name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to   having a high level view of your company and all resources available   within your company and how to deploy them.

Also,   in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which  provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control,  distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining  Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic  solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This  goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend  had mentioned that  her company’s marketing team was “really excited  about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company’s marketing  team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team  (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos,  videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big  pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint.  Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team  can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content,  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight  into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The  acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand  out in this department.

Nobody   really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days   for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out   quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a   light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary   plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet’s   FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief   Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B   for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing   department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All   kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content  that  effects the company’s brand. Sales is running social media  campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts,  and R&D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get  really difficult for  the company’s Marketing/Branding team to stay on  top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration  platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I  think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.

As   you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their  core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal  upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that,  Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that  empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that  streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many  instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline  a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT  departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build  these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes  away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical  projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing  no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes  that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and  thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code  platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get  work done than an IT department employee who  doesn’t even do the job  that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce  strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and  mission critical projects.

Here   is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet   customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): “I have been waiting for a solution like   WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we  need,  when and where we need it,” said Hina Patel, Director of Sales   Operations at Cisco. “The ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along   with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive   app will make it even easier to drive active participation from  everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.” As you can  see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform  appears to be  high.

Lastly,  Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is  essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet  customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the  most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2%  of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:

Subscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue

Professional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue

This   is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop   Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth   answer of the question – “Can we 10x from here?”

2021-06-09,Roku Overview and Brief Bear/Bull Case,"Roku Overview and Brief Bear/Bull Case 1-year Stock performance: 200%

Company value (market capitalization): $45 Billion

StockTalk ownership: 0% of members

Roku was started in 2002 by Founder and CEO Anthony Wood. Many of us have seen Roku’s popular streaming boxes and sticks. These connectors provide customers with Roku’s connected TV platform which provides access to a variety of streaming channels, including Roku’s own channel. Roku generates over 70% of its revenue from its connected TV platform, which saw growth of 71% in 2020. Revenue consists of advertising, subscriptions, and revenue-sharing agreements with streaming platforms such as Netflix. The balance of Roku’s revenue comes from the actual sale of its hardware devices, though Roku has also launched an app accessible through Smart TVs. The hardware is really a hook to get customers to use its platform.

Roku faces competition from big-tech players like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Google (GOOG) which have developed their own streaming platforms that provide access to many of the same channels. Roku’s own streaming channel also competes for viewership directly with the likes of Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX).

Fun Fact: The name Roku means “six” in Japanese. Roku got its name because it is the 6th company founded by CEO Anthony Wood. 

What the BULLS 🐂 say: Roku has created a powerful flywheel. As Roku grows its user base, channel providers want to be on Roku devices, and as the number of channels expand, more users desire access to the platform. A larger user base not only leads to increased revenue share, but also greater revenue from advertising partners. Roku’s compelling product offering, coupled with continued growth in the streaming market, will continue to fuel the company’s growth and margin expansion.  

What the BEARS 🐻 say: Roku lacks a competitive advantage. Roku is facing stiff competition from platforms like Apple’s Apple TV, Amazon’s Fire Stick, and traditional TV providers like Comcast. These companies have greater reach and more scale, allowing them to undercut Roku’s pricing and negotiate better deals with content providers such as Disney. While it’s had a nice run, Roku will lose market share to these much more powerful players over the long run.

At first I was really big on dividend stocks and making passive income.. but that was a little too slow for me. About 6 months ago I switched my whole portfolio to growth stocks, Tesla being my biggest position, and I’m kind of obsessed with watching the market now. I’m mainly focused on disruptive growth stocks I could see dominating their industry within the next 5-10 years. 

My current positions are in Skillz (SKLZ), FuboTV (FUBO), Hims SPAC (OAC), Proterra SPAC (ACTC), NIO, Lucid SPAC (CCIV), Sofi SPAC (IPOE), Lemonade (LMND), Square (SQ), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). I’m always looking to analyze and add more. 

As you can see by the sheer number of SPACs I’m holding, I’m not afraid of taking a calculated risk. Which companies are you watching that you believe could 4x or will be industry leaders within the next 5-10 years? Any IPO’s or SPACs I should watch out for?

Sigh.  It will never change for the better.  NEVER!, will it?.  The old idea of the 21st century future has been scrapped!  And replaced with the complete opposite.  It’s such an insufferable spectacle.  Doesn‘t it bother anyone else that society appears to have declared its complete and utter abandonment of interest in and acceptance of the idea of valuing devices because they look cooler and more futuristic and embracing this aesthetic of having cool-looking devices (other than phones!  And not even that.  iPhone!!!)  What do they make it all about instead?  Tacky hideous ridiculously old-fashioned apparel and decor!  It just goes on and on and on endlessly with this complete and utter antithesis to newness, for lack of a better way to describe it.  And that’s what they make it all about!  Making all these ads look like they show scenes from the early 1970s.  So it’s just all about the most un-innovative possible things!  It’s just all about websites and apps to sell mundane things other than innovative devices, and hideous fashion, that’s the best!!!  THAT’s what it’s all about!  NEVER devices anymore!  For shame!  Not only that, it appears society is also completely rejecting IOT from the ads.  Now that may not be the case, but you wouldn’t know it from the ads, because they never say anything, at least hardly whatsoever, about controlling other devices with a smartphone.  All these smart devices I read about over two years ago, and absolutely NOthing about any of them!  All these many smart home companies that can’t make one single commercial, or even internet still image ad!  OUT OF THE QUESTION, TOTALLY, for them to advertise their own product AND tout that it looks cooler/ more futuristic as a reason to choose it over similar devices!  And they also couldn’t even talk about any innovative functionality of it.  Just look at Facebook’s ads for Portal.  How many have they done now?  And never ONCE have they mentioned that it features Alexa!!!  All they do is show it as a videophone!  It has all these very innovative capabilities, but they can NEVER talk about them, can’t even say Alexa.  Ad after ad where it’s just a videophone!  And what about Echo Show?  Don’t say it’s cool!  No no no!  Just show it as a music player that plays old music for the elderly, not that there’s anything wrong with that and no offense, but how can I not mention that in regard to this, make of it what you will.

2021-12-10,It seems like nobody is embracing real innovation and would rather live in the 1970s or something from all these commercials you see.,"It seems like nobody is embracing real innovation and would rather live in the 1970s or something from all these commercials you see. I just keep waiting and waiting and waiting.  I shouldn’t have made the mistake of watching old commercials on YouTube, because I compare this year’s commercials to those, but even if I hadn’t, I’d still notice.  First, I’ll describe some of those ads from the ‘90s to show how technologically forward-thinking they were, how they advertised things that were ahead of their time, that I didn’t even know they had then.  In late 1992, a voice-activated car phone!  A 1993 Magnavox ad concerning... unbelievably, a remote-like device with a screen that could actually type what you say by voice recognition, like you’d say, “record this show at 10:00, and then you put this near the VCR and it instructs the VCR to record the show!  You see what I mean?  What?  Homelink, whereby the lights would automatically switch on in one’s house when their car approached, in a mid-1995 commercial!  You see?  Now, let’s compare that to this year’s commercials.  There are multiple truly innovative things that I read about over two years ago now, that they STILL say nothing about!  Smartphone control of appliances, voice control of appliances!  WHERE IS IT?  They said they were making countless devices with Alexa and Google Home recognition in 2019, over two years ago!  What of progress?!  What of the magic of technological device innovation, where the true innovation is!  What of being able to say, “Back in my day, we didn’t have this snazzy stuff.  We’ve come a long way!”  Don’t you care about that?  These ads..  Turn the page, the future, new era!  No, no, no.  Instead, this!

For one example, Google, a tech company with all this state-of-the-art technology.  What do they show in their ads?  How about searching Google to buy CANDLES!  AND... drum roll... a Turn Table!!  @#$#@#$#@  Of course!  EVERYone just loves those fantastic turn tables now in 2021!!!  So Google, instead of EVER talking about their smart display anymore, which itself can play music, encourages people to reject innovative devices and re-adopt anachronistic technology.!  Come on people.  Why are they so scornful and opposed to true innovation, to entirely new revolutionary capabilities like voice control of appliances and so forth.  No, turn tables!  Seeing all these turn tables and records in commercials is maddening,  I can’t take any more!  That was outdated by 1980, if not even earlier, 42+ years ago, and yet all these people younger even than that have re-adopted it!  That’s a great example of what I’m talking about.  Touch of Modern .com always showing that turn table.  So turn tables are modern I guess!  THAT’s what they showcase.  “modern”!  Turn Tables!  Always with the turn tables!!!!  Please.. please stop.  Is it 1900?  What about smart displays!  Google won’t even advertise its own technology!

Dinosaur eye-sore CRT TVs shown in commercials, Sprite!, IMDB, etc., dinosaur eye-sore cassette stereos as old as the aforementioned TVs in too many commercials, one is too many, let alone that many!  Intentionally making ads look like they’re on Super 8 film!  Famous Footwear, more.  STOP.  IT. NOW!!!  That one’s kind of new.  They’ll probably have to ridiculously predictably and maddeningly do more like that even in 2022!  Don’t follow the stupid infuriating trend for once!  NO MORE of that!  Yeah yeah, go ahead. Argh!  Super 8 film!  Of course!  You see what I mean?  Outrageous.  NOT in 2022!!!!  Just watch, you’ll see.  As if the picture resolution weren’t already bad enough.  They have 8k now, yet they’re making commercials look like they’re on Super 8 film!  And look at Licorice Pizza!  It’s set in the early ‘70s and look at how poor the picture resolution is!  And that’s another thing.  At least 70% of the movies this year have been set at least 3.5 decades ago!  There are still many more examples, but I think that‘s enough.",0.0,Neutral,English

I  have been following Right to Repair for a while and fully support    everyone having the option (and right), and ability to repair their own    purchased goods. I would love to hear what  [u/larossmann](https://www.reddit.com/u/larossmann/)  or  [u/LinusLTT](https://www.reddit.com/u/LinusLTT/) thinks about my thought experiment and its possible implementation.

Say    Right to Repair laws/legislation pass overwhelmingly for all   industries  and its now a post right to repair world for the premise of   this  discussion. (I'll use electronics as an example category for my     questions because its interests me the most.)

* Would    tech companies change the form of products to match the needed    functionality and ease of being able to be repaired by a layperson? *The trope* ***Cassette futurism*** *comes to mind* *. Instead of having the slimmest iphone or android device weight and dimensions increase as a necessity for repair.*
* Would you support the above sacrifice of form to have the ability to repair with ease?
* Would this not create an enormous aftermarket for parts and new jobs to support the production of parts?
* Would this give companies the incentive to produce the strongest and longest lasting product ""chassis"" to stay market leaders?

Anyways    this was just a thought experiment for you all. Personally I would   200%  give up the form of a phone or personal electronic device for the    ability to repair it in house. Imagine having a beefy, maybe slightly    slower device, but the ability to go to a convenience store and pick  up a   new camera chip to throw in when it breaks or an upgrade is  needed.  Not  necessarily talking about module based electronics because  they  have  been tried and not that successful, but  relatively simple  parts  with  manufacturer supplied schematics in order to aid in repair  and   replacement. Just a thought (and possibly watching to many 80's  scifi   movies).",0.0,Neutral,English

I work on Internet of Things (IoT) projects and lead Client innovation projects in EMEA for IBM Corporate Strategy. I have a BSc in Computing and Mathematics and a PhD in Computer Science. In my spare time I enjoy Making, 3D printing, electronics and long distance running. I love to learn and spread knowledge wherever I can - I am a Visiting Professor at three UK universities and a Fellow of the British Computer Society.

 
One of the most exciting things I have been working on is the Mayflower Autonomous Ship, where I lead the IBM technical team. We contribute to a successful, fully-autonomous, transatlantic voyage of a marine research vessel designed to gather and analyse data on ocean health. The project seeks to evaluate the current state of our oceans while simultaneously advancing maritime exploration and research. Ask me anything about the technology driving the mission, the impact this project will make on the future of ocean science and the marine industry, and how AI and Automation technologies have been brought together to make a crew-less ship, controlled by an AI Captain, possible.

The iPhone is the only phone that can ever be shown in every commercial where they show a smartphone other than those specifically advertising other phones.  Also, in every little internet ad and stock photo or logo for every company with an app.  BIASED, and rather discriminatory.
2. This is in fact a technologically stunted 1990s rehash in which Apple’s products take precedence over all the more innovative devices, just because they’re Apple.  Possibly because Apple was also very prominent already decades ago, and was one of the earliest companies to advertise home computers, and people are so familiar with this old company just because they’ve been hearing about it for so long, that it’s now as if they’re hypnotized by it, and can only buy Apple products, no matter how non-innovative they are compared to other companies’ offerings, which they are.  Realize that.  Oh, but they don’t really care.
3. That iPhone with the home button that looks just like the original iPhone introduced 14 years ago (!) is shown in many commercials too!  If someone time-traveled from 1999 to now, they would be extremely unimpressed by this.  This 2007 era phone still being so popular that it’s shown in all those commercials.  And why is it shown?  Why, because it’s an iPhone, of course, and the iPhone, no matter how dated, is the only amazing, new-fangled internet phone that exists, and it’ll always be amazing because it’s 2007 and it’s that marvelous new iPhone!
4. Refer to #3.  That’s the equivalent of commercials containing mid-1980s brick phones in 1999 or even later, which they DID NOT!!! do!  Because people back then actually cared about innovation and were capable of switching to another company’s devices if they were more innovative.
5. The new Android phones are leaps and bounds sleeker and more innovative than the original, toy-like iPhone.  Sorry.  AND sleeker than the new iPhone!  Yeah, I know, that’s heresy to say that.  AND they’re more affordable.  Can anyone say they prefer the aesthetic of Android phones over that “beautiful”, be-all-and-end-all iPhone anymore?  No,they can’t.  Stand up for what’s futuristic!  Get them to show some Android phones with much smaller notches or circular cutouts already, instead of that 1980s brick phone old iPhone!  They’re being discriminatory, monopolizing everything. I prefer Android!  Am I the absolutely only one left!

On 28th-29th May we will be taking questions about the [PEARL](https://www.lifespan.io/campaigns/pearl-participatory-evaluation-of-aging-with-rapamycin-for-longevity/) project, whose aim is to launch a human trial with rapamycin to see if it has an influence on the aging process. It has been shown to increase lifespan in multiple species through its influence on the mTOR pathway, a central metabolic pathway but the human data is lacking. PEARL will aim to find out if rapamycin in humans can slow down aging.

>The PEARL trial will follow up to 200 participants over 12 months testing four different Rapamycin dosing regimens. It will be double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled and registered with clinicaltrials.gov. The principal investigator is Dr. James P Watson at UCLA, who was also a PI for the famous TRIIM trial. To ensure safety the participants’ blood will be regularly monitored and side effects noted.

The PEARL team including Dr. Sajad Zalzala and Anar Isman (CFA), from the PEARL team will be answering questions via  u/healthspanhero May 30th and 31st. Ask them about aging research, rapamycin, the PEARL trial itself, or whatever you want to know about their work!

I have read a lot about singularity, exponential growth etc. long back. For people old enough to remember 2000 seems like a completely different world, especially if you are coming from a developing world. 

Although i am confident of technological development happening fast i am not so sure about other societal changes. Counter intuitively does anyone feel that oligopolies like FAANG or IP protections slowing down growth (like Pharmaceutical cos or in Healthcare) is stopping the world from moving fast enough.

On the other hand easy money via MMT means that new companies also get funding fast and many new ideas are explored. One thing i am confident about is that renewable energy will be 80%+ new installations in less than 7 -8 years and now it seems inevitable that it will take over, much faster than what any conventional sources predict.

2021-04-22,Navigating a Digital Planet: Why Students can Never Know Enough Technology,"Navigating a Digital Planet: Why Students can Never Know Enough Technology Technology has irrevocably shaped the way all students learn inside and outside the classroom. This technological shift in education has allowed us to improve the way we process, deliver, and receive information. We recently discovered just how imperative technology is to virtual learning environments when faced with a seemingly unyielding pandemic, not to mention how debilitating it would be without digital devices in present-day circumstances.

It turns out being in a digitally confined setting isn’t all that bad when you understand its capabilities and perks over a traditional classroom setting. Pandemic or not, it seems the newer generations of students have implemented technology in every aspect of their day-to-day lives, but the question is, **is it enough**?

We are currently navigating an increasingly digital world, and the technology that we knew yesterday may very well cease to be relevant tomorrow, only to be replaced with its newer, faster successor. This is precisely why students of the digital world can never know enough technology, and why they can certainly know too little in our rapidly changing universe.

**1. The Technological Advantage**

I suppose you’re wondering, **why tech**? Why is it so relevant that we can’t progress without it? Well, there was a time not too long ago when most people could go their entire lives without ever having to pick up a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Not only has that time come and gone, but we are quickly moving away from any civilization in which technology takes a backseat.

Boomers and Millennials alike tend to emphasize their tech-free childhoods, full of outdoor playtime, kite making, fort building, scraped knees from falling off bikes, and so on and so forth. This is mostly a response of disapproval to the younger generation’s easy access to the internet, smart devices, video games, etc. However, it is important to recognize that it has become increasingly difficult, almost impossible, to live a technology-free life.

As technology rapidly advances, there is increased potential in both [productivity and economic growth](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/25/technology-and-the-future-of-growth-challenges-of-change/#:~:text=Advances%20in%20digital%20technologies%20hold,to%20the%20new%20digital%20technologies) for the future. Although there is serious concern that automation is slowly replacing current jobs that require manual labor, note that automation is also [creating millions of new jobs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/09/18/machines-will-create-million-more-jobs-than-they-displace-by-world-economic-forum-says/) in its wake.

Physical objects are constantly being replaced with their digital counterparts: stylists and tablets are replacing pen and paper, and most college acceptance letters are sent via email in an effort to go green. CDs and DVDs have long since been replaced with streaming services. Paychecks are almost always sent electronically, so learning online banking is an absolute must these days. Any major application, whether for jobs, college, or just about anything has to be done online. So, exposing children to iPads at a very young age may seem risky, but doing so will help them acclimate into the digital world. Moreover, it would be next to impossible to shield children from tech in the digital age, because tech is, quite frankly, everywhere.

Studies show mixed responses to how technology, particularly smart devices, affect the development of adolescents, as is highlighted in this [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/) from the Atlantic. Technology is sensational, but should be consumed in moderation, just like everything else. While the pitfalls of technology consumption among the younger crowd should never be ignored, it is important to recognize the benefits of technology adaptation in that same light. Toddlers have become so advanced at navigating through smart devices, in many cases, before they have even mastered how to walk. What’s more, studies show [increased improvements in hand-eye coordination ](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/study-links-childrens-eye-hand-coordination-with-their-academic-performance.html)for children who engage in repetitive interactions with computer screens and associate specific buttons with specific outcomes. Fostering a tech environment is also linked to the development of [problem solving skills](https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v2n2/pdf/deluca.pdf), which is fleshed out more in #3. 

In short, it is likely that children could be set back from their peers in the digital age if they lack technology skills. It is even more likely that a mastery in more advanced technology skills like coding could open up more doors for them in both their careers and personal lives, which conveniently brings us to the next section.

**2. Coding will Always be Relevant**

It is understandable to be intimidated by the concept of coding, especially if computer science in general comes off as anxiety producing for you rather than intellectually stimulating. But fear not, learning how to code is just like learning how to ride a bike; anyone can do it if they have the patience and dedication to acquire a new skill.

You may be wondering why you’d bother learning how to code, especially if you have made it this far in your life without ever having to write an app or build a website (hint: these things involve coding). At its core, coding just means computer programming, which is the process of designing and building a program to achieve a specific result or fulfill a specific purpose. You could say that coding is one of those niche skills that you didn’t know you needed until you mastered the skill.

Code is all around you. The reality is that there are plenty of careers that could benefit from coding expertise, and you don’t have to be an engineer or developer to reap these benefits. If you work in [marketing](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/post/how-b2b-and-saas-companies-can-market-their-software-effectively), for instance, you wouldn’t have to rely on a [software](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/) engineer to build landing pages for you if you were proficient in coding. 

Knowing even a rudimentary amount of HTML could assist you in building websites for a lifestyle blog (click [here](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/post/how-software-reviewers-can-get-more-readers) to learn about getting more blog readers) or a small side business. If you work in customer service or as a sales representative, you can easily help a customer out with a tech question without having to transfer them to the IT department. If you’re trying to [promote your business](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/post/how-b2b-and-saas-companies-can-market-their-software-effectively), you can use code to understand what algorithms google uses and use this knowledge to your advantage in your advertising strategy. 

Analysts, designers, and artists alike can all benefit from learning how to code. It may come off as surprising, but coding can be a central constituent of the social sciences. Linguists and sociologists alike value coding for its unique ability to assist in analyzing textual data. If you’re into literary analysis, which can be a painstaking process when done traditionally, you can speed up the process by manually coding qualitative data. At its core, code is just a language, and knowing how to code is akin to knowing another language.

What’s more, coding skills are in high demand across industries. Students are in luck, because one [report](https://www.burning-glass.com/wp-content/uploads/Beyond_Point_Click_final.pdf) shows that jobs that utilize coding skills pay $22,000 more a year, on average, than non-coding jobs ($84,000 vs. $62,000 per year).

Coding is an expansive topic like you wouldn’t believe, with many areas to choose from to best fit your desired purpose. If you’d like to jump right into coding, see below for some coding skills and languages that are in high demand right now:

* [SQL](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/new-ai/sql)
* [Python](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/software/python)
* [JavaScript](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/software/javascript)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/software/ruby)
* Java
* C++

* Perl
* iOS Family
* PHP

**3. Tech Skills Enhance Critical Thinking Skills**

Critical thinking is a valuable skill to have and, despite popular belief, it is not only learned through the humanities and the social sciences. Teaching children critical thinking skills early on is greatly encouraged, since these skills directly correlate with both [decision making and problem-solving](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/the_importance_of_critical_thinking_for_young_children#:~:text=Teach%20problem%2Dsolving%20skills.,of%20finding%20solutions%20to%20problems). In theory, it is never too early or too late to hone in and improve one's critical thinking abilities, and children and adults alike could benefit from learning how to apply critical analysis to their daily lives. 

When learning how to code, for instance, students learn about debugging, which is the process of searching for and rectifying errors in your [software program](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/). Bugs are typically the culprit when your computer program freezes or crashes, or when the main character in the video game you’re designing glitches whenever she interacts with a specific special item. 

This process of removing bugs isn’t as concrete and well-defined as you would think, and primarily consists of trial and error, but *that’s okay*. Believe it or not, most problems in life, computer science related or otherwise, are solved through trying and failing over and over again. This process is precisely why finally figuring out a solution to any problem you come across after long hours of contemplation is so satisfying and rewarding.

**4. 3D Printing is Booming Across Industries**

It’s unlikely that you haven’t heard about 3D printing, only because this technology has exploded over the last decade. You’ve probably seen a video on social media of some random object, like a miniature version of the Eiffel Tower, being created right before your eyes by a machine that almost looks like the offspring of a claw machine and an office printer.

3D printing, less commonly known as additive manufacturing, is essentially the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model. Purchasing a 3D printer will run you anywhere from $200 to $500 if you’re new to the hobby, but models can go up to $6,000 for more experienced users. Once you learn the fundamentals of using a 3D printer, which can be easily done considering the number of free resources you can find online, you can create just about anything you can think of from the comfort of your home or office. Think house decor, phone accessories, gifts for loved ones, tools, toys, furniture, art, board games, storage containers, wallets, organizers, locks, pen holders, toothpaste squeezers, and so much more.

The capabilities of 3D printing are virtually limitless. Countless industries utilize 3D printing and value people who are well versed in the skill. These industries include, but are by no means limited to, medicine, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, construction, and education. A proficiency in 3D printing would add to any resume and substantially boost your candidacy for a plethora of professions.

What’s more, 3D printing is significantly more environmentally friendly and cost effective than traditional manufacturing and mass production methods. This technology produces less waste since there is no need for drilling, cutting, milling, or packaging, not to mention less energy is being consumed overall in the absence of traditional manufacturing stages. Apart from reducing your carbon footprint, it is also worth mentioning that you can 3D print items that you probably would have bought in the store or online instead. This goes to show that investing in a printer now can actually save you money in the long run.

Purchasing a 3D printer has never been more affordable as it is now due to the rapid commercialization of a product that was originally meant solely for industrialization manufacturing purposes. Home usage was never intended, but it is remarkable that it worked out that way, since 3D printing can do everything from save you money to make you money. Not only is it a sought-out resume booster, but plenty of individuals sell their prints online on websites like Etsy, and even accept commissions for prints based on their buyer's needs.

In short, 3D printing is an absolute blast to get into and is well worth the $200 investment, especially considering this technology will only become [more prevalent across industries in the years to come](https://amfg.ai/2019/08/21/10-predictions-on-the-future-of-3d-printing-expert-roundup/). There is truly no better time to learn the 3D printing ropes and set yourself apart individually and professionally from the next generation of job seekers. Plus, 3D printing happens to be a great conversation starter for networking purposes. 

This article serves as a mere taste of the endless possibilities' technology presents to students of all ages, and it is by no means an expansive list. There is no right way to get into tech and there is no wrong way to improve the tech skills you currently possess. Technical skills take time to develop, so take time out of your day to learn, or teach your loved ones the basics: how to work a keyboard, or type more efficiently, or use word processing applications, or basic troubleshooting, because skills like these are in always in demand and are required for most professions. From there, gradually progress into more challenging yet worthwhile subjects like [excel spreadsheets](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-use-excel-tips), [artificial intelligence](https://www.softwaretoolsreview.com/post/the-importance-of-artificial-intelligence), [cloud computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/), or [circuit board design](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pcb-basics/all). Encourage, but never force, students of all backgrounds to find tech hobbies that they are interested in. The tech industry is a vast and ever-growing field, and within it is truly something for everyone to sink their teeth into.",0.0,Neutral,English

2021-04-01,Advances in Telemedicine IoT Devices / What’s New in Telemedicine IoT World?,"Advances in Telemedicine IoT Devices / What’s New in Telemedicine IoT World? To date, the world needs the ability to receive information and help on their health remotely more than ever. The constraints of the pandemic put many groups of patients at risk of not receiving timely care. Patients in remote locations, the elderly, and people with complex conditions require constant monitoring. Not only that, it is important to continue to reduce the COVID-19 infection rate by sticking to social isolation practices. 

Telemedicine, being the answer to this, is far from idle. More and more devices for monitoring the basic indicators of human health are getting out there. Yet, most of them do not give a complete picture of the test results and do not have the ability to synchronize data between devices or transfer parameters to the attending doctor for consultation.

That’s where the Internet of Things helps to solve the problem of interaction between various gadgets, combining and synchronizing data from equipment connected to the network and sending data to systems that notify the doctor about the patient’s condition, helping to quickly respond when necessary.

Let’s take a look at the new Telemedicine IoT devices and what the future holds in store for us. 

Mad@Work: Managing stress levels with AI

An ambitious project led by the VTT company and the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health. This project participates in the Smart Health ecosystem and is leaps and bounds into the future. The company believes in telemedicine strongly and confidently supports its position with new developments.

The Mad@Work project, while aimed at tracking the mental and physical health of remote workers, can prove to be a new angle to monitoring a patient’s health and wellbeing. As a considerable portion of the world’s workforce is still working remotely, people tend to forget to rest while under the pressure of delivering results. At some point, we do not even notice the stress on our body, and that can result in drastically bad health outcomes: breakdowns, apathy, cardiovascular issues due to blood pressure spikes, and more. 

The key to success for this service lies in its connectivity and aid of artificial intelligence in order to make the right call at the right time. Considering the use of this technology alongside the doctor’s watchful eye, it can prove to be a great boon to many therapists and doctors worldwide. 

Portable Hemodialysis System

Hemodialysis is, by far, one of the life-saving technologies out there that helps people with otherwise unfunctional kidneys continue to live - by providing extrarenal blood purification. The NxStage System One is a portable hemodialysis system that has already received approval for home use in the US. A portable system that can be used at home (and has to be used daily), there is always a paramount need to stay in touch with the attached doctor or clinic. 

This development tackles this problem with the help of IoT protocols: the System One device is capable of interfacing with the Nx2me Connected Health app, which collects information about the treatment directly from the device and can send it over to other Telehealth solution available to the selected clinic or doctor. 

Hospital Remote Medical Tablet 

Philips has recently unveiled a computer tablet that can provide easy and remote access to patient’s vitals. The device can operate over a standard WiFi connection, and there is no need to undergo difficult integration operations in order for it to work. The Medical Tablet operates on Windows 10 OS. 

While this device might be a little bit different from what Telehealth strives to be, this is one of the directions that are certain to go beyond in-clinic patient monitoring. With the help of the Medical Tablet, the hospital staff can track multiple patients remotely and receive alarms about their state. With safety concerns, rising workloads, and ever-advancing technological improvements, this is a necessary step forward. 

On top of being used to monitor patient vitals in emergencies, the Medical Tablet can be used as an extra screen or clinical workspace within the hospital’s IT network. 

Multipurpose Patient Monitoring Device

Caretaker Medical has developed a gadget that allows you to check the level of blood oxygen, breathing rate, pulse, pressure, and body temperature of the patient. The device can synchronize this data with the patient’s phone and transmits data through the application to the attending physician, who in turn can prescribe the treatment without forcing the patient to stand in long reception lines. 

The device is still pending some FDA approvals on its functions. It’s hard to understate the importance of such a device when it comes to monitoring the core vitals of patients both in-clinic and at home. 

Remote respiratory tracking

Strados Labs, a US-based company, is actively developing a system capable of monitoring lung sounds. This device is aimed to help clinicians remotely track the lung sounds of patients and monitor the lung condition over time in the provided app. The device’s capabilities can go as far as tracking the impact of COVID-19 on long-term lung capacity. 

The device acts as a stethoscope and records auscultation sounds, like coughing. This data is then stored in the HIPAA-compliant cloud solution that can be accessed by doctors for tracking and reviewing at any time. 

Vitals Tracking Ring

Oura, a Finnish startup is taking a different approach to a vitals-tracking technology and presents a device in the form a smart ring, capable of measuring temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, even fevers that could be related to COVID-19. 

The startup’s focus is making sure the ring, apart from being a vitals monitor, will detect subtle changes in body temperature that are characteristic of the early stages of COVID-19 infection, and alert the user of the potential issue. 

The works harmoniously with the Oura app, and can present the user with various health graphs, alerts, and much more. 

Conclusion

Telehealth and IoT is a pair made in heaven, and various new devices and gadgets that slowly trickle into our life make that so much more apparent. While it takes a while for innovation to truly appear on the market due to the lengthy process of testing and governmental approvals, it’s important to keep an eye on newcomers on the market and their potential use for your patients and doctors.",0.0,Neutral,English

Please keep in mind, to reliably simulate the human brain one does not need [replicate the brain in it's entirety as artificial synapse fire 20 million times more rapidly than human brain synapse](https://futurism.com/artificial-brains-operate-like-humans-close) - in fact the suggestion that computers need to match the Human Brain at a 1-1 ratio flies in the face of what computing is about at it's most basic level - doing more with less. 

Due to these exacting and far more efficient mechanisms found in current CPU's - it has been stated by Minsky and countless other computer scientists that all that is needed for a digital simulated brain to exhibit emergent behavior is 4 trillion parameters of training data. In most cases, partial data.

What is most needed is more computational throughput, it has been speculated and affirmed that once we have in fact created emergent AI - the training data needed will shrink to minimal values.

[Take Google Assistant](https://www.slashgear.com/google-assistant-soon-1-200th-size-on-phone-and-near-real-time-07575840/) - which was trained on a far larger data premium of over 100GB then re-optimized to fit within 1/200th size specification of this specification. Or far less than 1 gb.

[Ben Goertzel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpSmCKe27WE) ""Google, Microsoft and Other Companies already have the 10 trillion parameter data sets needed to properly train Emergent AI, where our little indie startup has to rely and scrounge up training data material in a far more cost effective way""

[Vinge - ""Machine Learning: the subfield of artificial intelligence tasked with making decisions of new data from a partial observation of the state space.""](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-is-not-the-key-to-unlocking-the-singularity-913f960ac345)

To create a comprehensive expert system that communicates emergent features - like a human, one need far less data than one would need to create an authentic copy of the Human Brain. 

Take for instance this example 'It took 1,000 different images to train a neural network to identify a cat'. 

The human brain perceives images differently, frame by frame - viewing a cat in action is akin to consuming over 1,000,000 frames of data over a 7 1/2 minute period.

At 4 trillion training parameters, the training data becomes empirical and 4 trillion data parameter's becomes recursory due to this parameters are reclassified as Hyperparameter's - or extremely high precision empirical data that can be effectively retooled and amplified to create more empirical data. 

Extrapolated, 4 trillion parameters would meet and exceed 10 trillion data parameters with proper reinforcement based machine learning algorithms applied.",0.0,Neutral,English

[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/txt_accordion1.html) has a great 
system that they use that can be applicable to just about any technology.  I see commentary
on the sub all the time when a new article comes out to the effect of ""X discovered in lab"" or
""Y successful in initial test"" and the comment is something derogatory like ""Call me when this is in production""
or ""$10,000 per lb in the lab? That will never work"" I'm sure youve seen them. Using TRL's can help us understand what
questions we _should_ be asking, rather than making irrelevant comments about expense or manufacturability _at the wrong level_.
So lets go through the levels and talk about the questions we _should_ be asking.

TRL 0: Science Fiction

Criteria: No mathematical formulation or physics exists that says that this is possible.  This can also mean that there is no mathematics that says it _doesnt_ exist either

Examples: Negative Matter, Harry Potter Magic

Questions you should be asking: What Math or physics shows that this is possible?

TRL 1: Science Fact

Criteria: Math and physics that affirmatively show that the technology _is possible_ and offer some 
basic tests that could be used to prove or disprove the physics

Examples: Aclubierre/White warp drive, Portals/Wormholes

Questions you shold be asking: What discoveries are preventing the test needed to do this in a lab?
What tests do we need to do to prove/disprove that this is possible?  What is the current state of that testing?

TRL 2: Lab State

Criteria: Laboratory or observational experiments have been performed to prove at the most basic level that the technology/material exists.
No production of tech other than for lab use/experiments exists

Examples: Antimatter, DNA data storage, Many Medical treatments

Questions: What does a prototype production system look like?  Does this work the same when its not in a lab? 

TRL3: Prototype production

Criteria: Tech still in the lab typically but more production/funds is needed to support futher experiments or a desire to move to the next phase

Questions: How much does this cost to produce at scale?  What economies of scale are there?  Is there a market at the one off production price? What hurdles are there to production at scale? Are there VC or government sources for funding?

Examples: New battery tech, Fusion/ITER, Starship 2020/2021

Questions: 

TRL 4: Startup

Criteria: The prototype production method is successful enough and there is sufficient market that venture capital is interested.  Cost may be relatively high for product
at this point, target market is first adopters.

Examples: Lab grown Meat, new battery technologies, Tesla circa 2008

Questions: What is the market size?  Is it large enough at that price point to increase production and reduce
costs enough to move to the next TRL?

TRL 5: Growth

Criteria: Startup production is successful, and the market is sufficient enough that sales are high enough to start generating economies of scale.  Price per unit starts to drop, and wider markets are being explored

Examples: Electric Cars, Cell phones circa 1995-2005, Steel circa 1860

Questions: Who are the competitors?  What tech do other companies have that is competitive? What is the price vs total production curve

TRL 6: Commodification

Criteria:  Useage of product is widespread, economies of scale are large enough that competitieon is fierce and prices are reduced as much as possible

Questions: What tech is out there that is going to supersede this one?

Examples: Steel today, Smart Phones, T-Shirts

TRL 7 : Superseding

Criteria: Some other tech exists that is replacing this one because it is better/faster/cheaper

Questions: Are legacy companies doing enough to stay afloat?

Examples: Blockbuster 2005, Film cameras 2007, Paper, Horse and buggy 1910-1920",0.0,Neutral,English

2021-12-18,Needless Terror From Glitching Balance Calculations (anyone else experience this?),"Needless Terror From Glitching Balance Calculations (anyone else experience this?) I'll try to keep it short:

- Holding an SPX bear call credit spread that expires a loser yesterday (strikes are 4595 and 4600, close was 4620). Was barrelling in my direction near the end of the day, but didn't get there, and in the end, was only somewhat in the vicinity. Spread width is 5, so I'll end up eating that on the trade (minus the credit). No problem, and no other options positions currently open, just some long stock and a short futures contract.

- I, like everyone else, have heard all the ""pin risk"" horror stories. One of the reasons I like SPX is specifically because it's all cash-settled so there will never be shares involved, or the assignment risk that goes with that, so it never occurs to me to feel wary about holding to expiration and letting it do what it will.

- Click on ToS at 2 AM last night to check balances and see that I suddenly have a Regulation T margin call warning on my account, and my balances are insane. Like, -$75,000 cash, -$250,000 stock buying power. Everything is red, minus signs/parentheses with 5 and 6 digit dollar amounts, and warning messages. I pray that it's just thinkorswim doing something weird, but I log on to the TDA site and see the same kind of thing in my account info. Basically ""you are/may be getting margin called and need to resolve this immediately.""

I grab the phone panicking for an explanation for what the hell is going on, and just as the representative gets on the line... poof. Everything onscreen is suddenly fine. Balances are what they should be, and the margin call warning disappears. I said nothing and did nothing. I explain to her what I am seeing, or at least what I was seeing a minute before, and she says that everything looks OK on her end, and has no real explanation for what happened, other than assignment of the option-legs possibly causing some sort of temporary havoc with balances that ""should"" be resolved by Monday. 

I also noticed this on the site, only after this was all over, and which wasn't mentioned by the representative:
""Balances and Positions may be inaccurate Friday, December 17th from 8:00 p.m. ET until Saturday, December 18th 1:00 p.m. ET as we implement system enhancements.""

Could have been something to do with that.

So one heart-attack later, my question is, did this happen to anyone else, or has it in the past? Is this a regular occurrence? If it's just glitchy balance-handling by their software, then TDA REALLY needs to get a handle on this, because it was absolutely panic-inducing.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-11-23,Locked out fraud investigation,Locked out fraud investigation I have well more then 50k+ in my bank. I deposited 50k to td and bought a stock on margin call because I was super confident. The day day the stock soars up. The account value profits 30k then 2 days later I get a maintenance call and am like wtf? So I call my bank and they claim that they called me because it was a large amount but I never answered (which I don’t really pick up to random numbers due to 1000 scam likely calls) so the rejected the deposit. So that makes sense it’s understandable. They said now that they had confirmation tell them to re run it and it’ll be ok this time. so I call td and they lock the account mid phone call they say it’s sorta too late and lock the account. So I’m like fuck I still had positions. The next 2 days the balance stays the same ( I know from calling) then on the third day they liquidate my position (in which I believe they have the right to do so) and take their initial investment that I owe them back. Leaving me with profits. Also charged me with the bank reversal fees which is understandable. Fast forward another 2 days of me trying to get my account back. I call to check my balance and they took the profits from that stock as well. And now I’m just here like what the Fuck if I had lost on that trade I would’ve definitely had to pay them back the money I owe but since I profited they got to keep it. Now did I invest for me or for td? Congrats for them getting a free 30k.,0.0,Neutral,English

I have had this happen a few times before with TD, but it always corrects back the the real CPS sometime early in the trading day. Today, it has not corrected, and I am still in the red. Am I just overreacting to a minor accounting software glitch that will correct itself, or did my money really disappear? Has anyone else encountered this problem?

Some of what I've read states that this is just a clerical bookkeeping notation that TDA notates\\uses but doesn't really incur financial meaning.  In other places, I read that this amount needs to be paid immediately.  I just don't understand why if our stocks are already paid for in full, we would owe any monies. Is this figure just something that will ""go away"" this coming week when the market rebounds?

That was May 24.

On June 17 I sent an email asking about status. The next day the reply was that two of our documents didn't pass muster and I'd have to upload others. There's noplace on the site to upload them; the spots on the website are disabled, presumably still with the old documents.

Most of my portfolio activity is in weekly covered calls.  If my option gets to 90% profit before Friday, I want to sell it and roll to the next week.

Of course, there are times where the buy to close executes but the sell to open doesn't because the prices have changed.

The issue I'm having recently is that I am unable to then cancel or edit that unexecuted sell! Sometimes I can't even see it in my open orders, but it's still there because it won't accept a new order.

Questions regarding the technicalities and lack of funds to cover the position Hello, my question involves assignment and how it is handled when the funds aren't sufficient to cover either the long or short position.

Ex 1) $6000 account

Sell a SPY 430/435 call spread and spy closes 433 at expiration and we are assigned and since we don't own the stock, would our account be short 100 shares? How does this work at TD with a roth? 

Ex 2) $6000 account

Buy the AAPL 130/135 call spread and AAPL finishes 133 at expiration. The option auto exercises and we have to purchase $13000 worth of AAPL stock. The problem is that we only have $6000 in the account!

&#x200B;

I need help clarifying these situations. Thanks


UPDATE: I contacted TD support for definite answers. 


EX 1) The risk department would likely flag this situation and close the contracts. This is not a guarantee though and anyone in this situation should be extremely careful because it potentially go through. Buyer executes --> $43k in your account and you are short 100 shares. If the stock moons after hours or the next morning before you can buy to close, your loss could potentially be much greater.

EX 2) The risk department would close this trade. Once again though, it could potentially sneak through and your account would be exposed to potentially more risk than you wanted if it executes.

I'm heavy into a certain stock that TDA currently considers restricted, and regularly write covered calls against the shares I already own.

The problem is TDA doesn't let you do that over the web. You have to call in and ask them to put the trade through manually, in which case it's not a problem at all, except for the time consumed (and occasional end of trading session missed) by having to call them every single time to do this.

I'm beginning to feel like it's an imposition to have to call mommy and daddy and ask them for permission every time I want to write a call against shares I own already, or a put secured by cash that I already have in my account. Today I missed the end of the session, and couldn't make the sale, because of it. I feel like TDA is putting undue pressure on me and it's impacting my trading. 

I thought about just buying another hundred shares and immediately selling it back every time, but that's $15000 (as of today) that I need to keep liquid to do that, plus incurs risk of losses from poorly-timed sudden market moves.

After doing the inicial process through the website, I have received the ""New Account Cover Sheet"" as below with instructions on how to proceed.

> Based on the information you provided, you must send us the following documents to complete opening your account:
>

> - One of the following:
>   - A copy of your bank (or financial institution) statement, written in English characters. (Make sure the name and address on your statement match the name and address on your new TD Ameritrade account.)
>   - A copy of your proof of residence: a gas, water, or electricity bill, or a household register, written in English characters or a certified English translation. (Spanish is also acceptable.) We cannot accept a credit card statement, or a phone, TV, or satellite provider bill as proof of residence.
> - IRS Form W-8BEN

I have a few concerns about the documents required above as follow:

- My bank statement is written in portuguese and may contain non English characters such as `ã á à ç`. Would that be a factor to prevent me from opening up an account?
- My electricity bill is not on my name (It's on my Mother's), would it be ok to use it?
- I do have a passport and a tourist visa so that's ok.

And finally: Is there a more convenient way of sending these documents than via fax?

Today I was trying to contribute to my Roth IRA in TD Ameritrade and I found out that the only 2 ways to deposit into my account is via check or wire transfer, although I have connected a TD Bank account to the brokerage ACH was not available. So, I called the customer service and they told me that this is because my resindency status is Non-Resident Alien. I live, work and pay taxes in the US, and for all tax purposes I am considered a US resident, but my current visa technically classifies me as non-resident. The reps were polite, but none of them knew why this is the policy over non-residents. I asked to talk to someone that can answer my question: **Why are non-residents unable to do ACH deposits, while they can do wire transfers?**

They transfered me to a supervisor. The supervisor simply told me ""the firm made a decision"". When I explained that both ACH and wire transfers are extremely similar bank transfer methods and insisted on why this is the firm's decision, he said that it's because wire is more secure, because it goes through the federal reserve. Can you believe this answer? I didn't know a supervisor could be both inaccurate and wrong in the same sentense. Here is the deal: both ACH and wire transfers go through the federal reserve and actually ACH is considered more secure. What was this guy talking about? Do they normaly bs their customers like that? Btw I was extremely polite the whole time.

To top it all off, the supervisor said that I could initiate an ACH transfer with him over the phone, which means that he would actually bypass the firm's policy. What are these guys on? The irony and stupidity was too much for me to handle at this point, so I thanked him and got off the call.

After lots of headache and having to visit my bank local branch, I managed to open a new bank account and everything transferred smoothly. 

The issue is that in that same week my brokerage account with TD Ameritrade was also fraudulently accessed and locked, and  my username and email with the account were changed without my permission. I called their client services number and explained everything. They said they can help me resolve this but what complicates things is that among the charges that my bank reversed was money I spent (over $50k) to buy shares through TD Ameritrade. 

I didn’t want for those charges to be reversed because I intended to keep those shares. The rep on the phone told me that I needed to login and add funds to keep the shares. I told her that I’m locked out from account due to the fraudulent activity, and she stated that they’ll be able to help and not to worry but need me to email a police report and they’ll contact me. 

I emailed them a police report the next day but didn’t hear anything back and was worried and called them back, they stated that it takes time and they’ll update me soon. Last week I received a letter in the mail stating that my shares were sold by the brokerage at an extremely low price, without my permission and after them assuring me that won’t happen and they’ll be able to help. I called them again and the rep sounded very confused and kept putting me on hold before the line cut off. 

To be clear, I have the money that I originally spent to buy those shares but I don’t want to lose them since I bought them at a low price. TD Ameritrade has something called “Asset Protection Guarantee” that they boast about on their website which is supposed to help client in these fraud cases but I haven’t seen any of it. I’m not sure what to do as I’ve never been in this situation before. I’ve been very stressed and losing sleep for the past month due to this. Where do I go from here?

And on top of it all, the generic message was sent and they immediately ended the chat, not letting me respond at all...I mean seriously, WTF? Could TD Ameritrade be more unprofessional right now?

This Friday, I had exercised options near the close of market and noticed after AH ended that the shares that were exercised were back in my account and the transaction that was previously filled was cancelled.

I thought this may be helpful in case someone wants to save the phone call in a similar position.

I was placed on a wrongful regulation T margin call. After speaking with Td Ameritrade on the phone I am told that the issue will be resolved by the next morning and the -300 fb shares that was showing up on my account will disappear along with the 3 calls to place my account back to the approximate value of 30-35k. I was also being charged for the current price of fb and therefore I was charged an extra 1600. On the night of 2/16 I was shown a balance of around 31500. On the morning of 2/17/21 my account was showing a negative balance of over 50k and I was unable to trade. I ended up missing out on several opportunities. When I called Td ameritrade I was told that they need to fix the balance before I can trade or take out my money, and gave me no estimated time frame. This is absurd and they should severely compensate for their mistakes. Anyone know steps I can take?",-0.8275799751281738,Negative,English

I was on the phone Saturday and if you see my recent post history you can see that I was one of the first people here to feel like something odd was happening when I received a notification about shares being assigned on closed calls... On Saturday I was told it should be fixed by Sunday.. On Sunday I was told Monday.. Monday I was told Tuesday and today I didn't even bother but I can see we still haven't had the issues fixed. 

**This is really messed up and no one is talking about it.** 

I read from a fellow reddit user that they should be able to just make your trades disappear but how would that work if the trades assigned to some was bought from a trader using a different platform who already closed his positions etc? It goes beyond my investor understanding. 

I have a feeling they are going to continue to low-ball us. 

TD margin is expensive! TD commissions on options isn't cheap... W T F man.

**Questions:**

Will those affected be compensated for their losses? 

Will we be given lower margin rates and free commission if you were affected?

If our trades are cross-platform, how can that be reversed?

Will this have tax implications for some who did not want to sell off their positions when using covered calls?

Would still be asking WTF if you guys weren't willing to sit on hold and update us. No email or any other notification in TOS.

Not to mention that they have had multiple crashes of their system over the last 10 months and then these type hiccups occurring every couple months. It's pretty bad that I am comparing TD's customer service to Robinhood and realizing that I've been getting better customer service from Robinhood. So disappointed.


If anybody has other brokerage recommendations I would appreciate. I currently have Robinhood, webull, TD, and ironbeam futures account. Most of my $$$$ is in TD.

2021-02-12,Rant about trading AMC Options,"Rant about trading AMC Options TD Ameritrade has put trading restrictions on several volatile stocks recently, including GME and AMC. I understand putting some restrictions on these stocks, especially for newbies, but restrictions on covered calls, is ridiculous and unjustifiable.

They make you call in to place trades like selling a covered call or naked put on AMC. I've had to call in 3 times over the last week, and every single time I have to wait on hold for over an hour. And every single time, I get a worse trade price than I would have if they just let me trade it myself. If you're going to make people call in to make a trade like it's the 1950's, then at least have the manpower to answer the phones and not have your customers wait on hold for an hour every single time.

At the moment, I want to sell a naked put on AMC... my max loss on this trade is $300.... So they've had me on hold for 1 hour so far, because they're afraid I'll make a reckless trade and lose $300?? I've had to do the same thing on covered calls which don't even had a downside risk.

If you're going to make people call in, have people to answer the phone. I'm losing money on every trade because of these arbitrary restrictions. You approved me to trade options... what's the point if you don't trust me to trade options? Either change these restrictions, or hire more people. I've never gotten a hold of anyone at TD in less than 45 minutes. It's ridiculous.

Regardless, I had connected my bank account and made a $3k deposit to my TD account. Apparently my bank account balance was a little less than $3k when TD finally went to deduct it from my bank. I typically transfer funds from account to account using Google Pay, but they made some changes that don’t allow me to instantly transfer funds, so it’ll take me a few days to move enough money from one account to the one connected to my TD account. 

I got an iPhone notification this morning saying my margin call is due today, so I’m trying to log into my account but it’s basically acting as if it doesn’t exist?

I’m currently on hold (wait is up to 1.5 hours it said), but I figured I’d make a post to see if anyone has experienced the same issue.

2021-02-09,"New on TD from Robinhood, overall think it’s solid but a few major qualms....","New on TD from Robinhood, overall think it’s solid but a few major qualms.... After seeing how quickly Robinhood would turn on and sell out its customers, I immediately started researching brokerages and landed on TD as it seemed to have the best combo of features, ease of use, aesthetics, and customer service. After using it a week, it’s an overall generally pleasant experience, but there are some significant issues I have with the service:

1. No iOS widget or dark mode - how is this possible for a company this size? Dark mode is an absolute necessity and something every other brokerage has. I shouldn’t need to go to thinkorswim to get a black background at night. And a widget that simply shows my balance and the days gain/loss % is such a low effort task that it boggles my mind that they haven’t done this. They really need to join the rest of the brokerages and keep up with the tech.

2. Too many steps to see a stock’s info/chart - it should never require two clicks to get to a stock’s page after clicking it in my portfolio. I despise needing to click “view details” every time, it’s such an unnecessary extra step that makes things a lot more cumbersome to navigate. 

3. Speaking of charts, why can I not see the percentage return over the period of time I select on the chart? When I select 3 months, I should be able to see the % it is up in that period very easily, however this requires you to go into settings and change the y-axis settings. Completely insane and so annoying that this simple info is not readily accessible. 

4. The cash sweep function is confusing as hell. I still don’t know how exactly it works, but they sure as hell don’t explain it. 

I really hope they address these things soon, I do like the platform overall, but the more I look at e-Trade it looks like their app looks just as good and seemingly has most of these missing features. Hopefully it doesn’t come down to me needing to switch again as it’s never an ideal task to switch brokerages but these things are low key driving me up a wall after using Robinhood’s very sleek and streamlined interface for so long.",0.0,Neutral,English

2021-02-06,What is your strategy ?,"What is your strategy ? If you don't know then you don't have one.  Where to start?  Note pad. Sounds old school right! Maybe it is but it will help cause you can always scratch off or add too. What makes it even harder is it has to change with conditions.  I look for over bought or over sold conditions. Easy way is to use RSI indicator.  Take a list of stocks and scan for over 70 or under 30 as on this indicator would represent those conditions. For Options you might scan for high implied volatility. The filters are endless so find what relates to your setup/ style.  TOS in my opinion has terrible scanner, I use [https://www.investorsobserver.com](https://www.investorsobserver.com/) it's not a free site but does a lot for the money.  One feature I really like is being able to search by sector.  Has a good Option screener also.  I use this for ideas then look at the charts and decide for myself  if and how to trade.

You can scan the whole world of stocks but I like to search my watch lists. Yes plural as I have several. Set them up by sector or interest after all these are stock you are interested in cause you have done the work, read the fundamentals or know something about them. Name them, sure Oil & Gas, Retail, Banks and Health Care come to mind but use what relates to you.  Computers/Semiconductors, Electric Vehicle, Cannabis, ETFs. One I just created is Rail and Road...why you ask? President Biden first week in office signed order to shut down Keystone pipeline, That oil will have to be delivered with other means!   Just like the pandemic created opportunity for gaming stocks, home improvement companies, Zoom and so on things that happen everyday create new opportunities so Just keep your ears and eyes open!

You should understand candle stick charts if that is what you use. Most do. I have taken the Steve Nison courses, not totally necessary as there are tons of youtube videos that explain the basics.  I studied  Ichimoku cloud and used it for a while but cam back to candles.  If you use Bollinger Bands like I do....Know them. I own every dvd John Bollinger has and took his training course.  A great book is Technical Analysis by  Kirk Patrick, [https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Analysis-Complete-Financial-Technicians/dp/0134137043](https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Analysis-Complete-Financial-Technicians/dp/0134137043)  it's like a collage text book that explains in detail about every technical analysis widely used. You want to use what most others are using in my opinion so you are seeing what they are seeing!  MacD is one of my Favorites but I learned for day trading on 1,5 & 30 minute charts to adjust both Bolinger Bands and MacD settings and defaults works great on the rest.  Just use the time frame apocopate to the trade you are doing. You can enter a 30 day trade off what a intra day time frame is showing if your just looking for a dip of the day to take position but the monthly chart would be showing the direction of where you want to end up at.

Another thing is the range, look at how much average range the underlying trades per day.  My self would never trade the Dow, it makes to big of a swing on any given day that it will stop me out most likely cause I won't risk that much on one trade.  There is a indicator call Average True Range but after a while you learn to see that without the indicator.

These are just some things that go into developing a strategy and writing them down, saying them out loud and even talking it through to yourself or someone else helps. Below is a chart of a trade I took the other day.  I scan for RSI below 30 in the results I have my scanner linked to a chart so when I click on the symbol it appears and can flip thru them fast. Now I am looking for a red candle that closes outside the lower Bollinger Band followed by a green candle that opens outside and closes inside the lower Bollinger Band.  See the first set to the left of the chart they did that right! But the MacD fast line (blue) was still well under the slow (yellow) line, CCI was still well below the -100 Green line( I changed the color of the lines to indicate to me that I want to buy off the bottom line and sell off the top) and the RSI was still below the oversold 30 line.  15 minutes later the red candle opens and closes below the bottom Bollinger Band and the next candle opens below the Bollinger Band to close inside the Bollinger Band what is different is the RSI now has come back inside the 30 oversold line as the CCI crosses the green -100 and the MacD crosses so I take a position of 500 shares at $57.87 hold for just over 5 minutes my signal to get out candle closes outside the upper Bollinger Band at $61.17 = $3.30 per share x500 = $1650.00 good day for me! LOL Not a parabolic move just simple, safe and consistent.

**TLDR: new account with $600 locked due to fraud last October. with more than 20 phone calls and a letter, still ""getting the we cant unlock it because fuck you"" response from customer service. Please help. THanks**

I started using TD Ameritrade last October. I was able to register and use the new account for 2-3 days, during which I transferred in $600 from my bank. Then, my account was locked, and when i called to inquire I was told it is flagged as fraud. Im a new immigrant who just got his SSN a year ago, and im a software programmer who has decent knowledge of the security realm. I do not suspect any fraud here, its most likely flagged as a fraud because I had just moved from CA to FL in September. 

Its been 4 months now with more than 20 phone calls, each rep has a different answer. Some told me to call again, some told me to wait, 1 person was even able to unlock it(got closed again the next day), the most recent rep told me to send some document which could prove my residency in FL, which i had sent a month ago. Today when I called, I still hear the ""I cant unlock it, you need to do what the email says"" crap（I never got an email response whatsoever but i kept getting monthly statments from them stating that theres $600 unused) .

2021-01-22,TD Ameritrade Customer Service Quality,"TD Ameritrade Customer Service Quality I am in the process of opening a (backdoor) Roth IRA with TD Ameritrade. Two reasons I picked TDA are:

1. Their options trading platform (ToS in particular).
2. Their 24/7 customer service.

So far, their customer service has really been disappointing. I've had the following issues:

1. **Not knowing how to open a new account**: I created a brokerage account at first. When I logged in and tried to open a Traditional IRA, the last step of the process wanted me to create a new username and password. I thought this was odd and wondered if I was doing something wrong. Called customer service and explained the situation and I spent over ten minutes on the phone with the agent trying to have me do different things. The call should have only taken a few seconds with the agent saying ""yes, you need a separate user name and password for each account, but then you can link accounts"".
2. **Not knowing what trades are allowed in an IRA**: I was able to open my (Traditional and Roth) IRAs and I called customer service about getting options approval. I explained to the agent that I was specifically interesting in vertical spreads. The agent informed me that they are not allowed in an IRA. I spent a while arguing with the agent, saying my research told me it was possible. He was adamant and wouldn't help me. FYI [here's](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/options-trading-in-ira-17876) the article from TDA which confirms this is allowed.
3. **Not knowing about their own IRA transfer process**: I asked the agent what the correct way was to transfer my (now funded) Traditional IRA to my Roth IRA. The agent told me I had to fill out a form, sign it and upload/mail it. I asked the agent if there was a way I could do this online since I do not have easy access to a printer and the agent refused saying the paper form had to be signed. Doing my own research, it turns out this can actually be done online ([reference](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=335169)).

For what it's worth, there were three different agents whom I called around 8 PM ET.

Is this the normal experience, or have I just had bad luck? Would it help to call during business hours instead?",-0.515412449836731,Negative,English

After the acquisition it started taking longer to get support. Now fast forward to today, I get put on hold for >30 minutes before hanging up. I sat through a bunch of day trading info before even put on hold., No callback option, just sit on hold. This shows me that me that TDA could give two shits anymore.

The text messaging option was a joke because I wait 1 hour to get a response and then it ends up resulting in ‘we will create a ticket and include your phone number “. The whole experience has me questioning why I chose TDA.

Looking on the bright side, they at least offer better service than the IRS.

I sold 5 shares of NIO to buy AAPL, and the \~$300 went towards ""cash and cash alternatives"", I then tried buying AAPL with it and it said I do not have enough buying power. Shouldn't the $300 be under buying power? I don't understand the difference between ""cash alternatives"" and ""buying power"". Is there a delay between a sell order being filled and money being available under ""buying power""? Or is this because I reached a limit on number of trades?

This suddenly makes the trading restrictions MUCH more severe than just ""only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account"".

'til now, that is!)

Despite the fact that these restrictions are neither documented on their website nor authorized in their customer agreement, their representatives (after abruptly ending the chat on me the first time I tried to ask why) attempted to justify this by saying that they need a human to make sure that you're not withdrawing cash that's needed for purchases.

Following is Fidelity's highly SECRET cash promotion rules.  You cannot find them on the site; they are only offered to some people to induce large transfers of accounts to Fidelity ; and even people who ""benefit"" from the promotion cannot confirm their own ""promotion status"" because the Fidelity web link is kaput.  Sound strange?  Notice the ""Offer Rules"" do not set out the traunches to ""earn"" a promotion payment-It seems they are discretionary, and when the ""Rep"" tries to induce you with the ""promotion"", no mention is made of the 14-month clawback if funds are removed, with no exceptions for RMDs.

Offer Rules: This offer is valid for existing Fidelity customers. In order to receive the cash bonus, you must designate  an existing eligible Fidelity brokerage IRA or brokerage account or open and fund a new eligible Fidelity  brokerage IRA or brokerage account on or after 10/23/2019.

Rollovers from a former employer's Fidelityrecord kept workplace savings plan are not eligible for this offer. Cash, eligible securities, and/or margin  debit balance transfers from external sources will be valued at the time Fidelity receives them.

Eligible accounts for this offer include nonretirement (individual or joint) or Fidelity IRA (rollover IRA,  traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP-IRA) brokerage accounts which meet the minimum funding requirements  for this offer. Inherited IRA accounts are not eligible. The bonus will be paid directly to the eligible  account(s). For purposes of this offer, new net deposits shall mean total external deposits or transfers  (including cash, eligible securities and/or margin debit balance transfers) minus assets withdrawn or  transferred out of the accounts within the qualification period. Account holders must maintain the minimum account balance (minus any losses related to trading or  market volatility, or margin debit balances) at Fidelity for at least twelve months from the date on which  the bonus award is credited to the account, or Fidelity may charge the account the cost of the bonus  award. In addition, account holders must not use qualifying deposits to purchase insurance or annuity  products offered or distributed by Fidelity within 60 days of receiving a bonus award, or Fidelity may  charge the account the cost of the bonus award.

2021-09-24,Fidelity has uninformed people at the “trading desk”.,"Fidelity has uninformed people at the “trading desk”. Not sure why they have such uninformed people working at a multi trillion dollar financial institution. 

Last Friday I called Fidelity to initiate a transfer to ComputerShare. 

First, the employee didn’t have a working knowledge of the process. Not a good sign, but after I told her Fidelity had recently sent out an internal instruction guide on how to handle DRS with ComputerShare, she was able to proceed. I asked her to transfer a specific lot number, and after a brief hold, she told me yes, we are good to go.

Cool.

BUT!

That is NOT what happened.

They transferred my very first shares in, regardless of the lot number. When I called back today to ask why, I spoke with a very knowledgeable man named James- I was informed that it’s not possible to transfer a specific lot number. 

So my first question is, why do they have uniformed people answering the phone at the “trading desk”?

Second question is why in the world didn’t they call me back and inform me of that when the initial process denied? 

Instead Fidelity just helped theirselves to a different lot number in my account, and decided to transfer those anyways! 

It leaves a super bad taste in my mouth that Fidelity will just tell you what you want to hear over the phone, even if it’s wrong information. Then they will help themselves to your account and transfer shares THAT AREN'T AUTHORIZED TO BE TRANSFERRED.


Yes, I was unaware that specific lot numbers cannot be chosen to DRS. That’s on me. I get it.

BUT FIDELITY SHOULD TELL PEOPLE THAT AND NOT TAKE SHARES OUT THAT YOU DIDN'T AUTHORIZE.


At least a call back and say sorry, that cannot be processed this way and ask you to reconfirm the shares that are leaving your account.


INSTEAD OF TAKING SHARES I NEVER SAID YOU COULD.

In addition, I will not trade there anymore because each deposit or trade has to cure another week b4 I can access funds. NO WAY!  ...The chat session was over one hour total.  :(

JULY 16, 2021

Fidelity: 

I am happy to help you find solutions.

Fidelity: 

You have reached our tech support group.

Fidelity: 

In addition to options trading and the cash balance is there any other topic we need to cover this morning?

hello. i was not happy with your curing policy where it takes more than one trading week to approve funds. no other brokerage does this, and it takes too long to operate. i could not buy back an option yesterday or today, and am getting errors so i deposited enough to buy out but still get the error. this is an ongoing problem that is making me regret fidelity.

Fidelity: 

I understand your concerns. I do believe this can be clarified and resolved. Our trading representatives, who are also in chat are equipped to help you with both the cash topic and the options trading topic. Would you like to chat with them about these two subjects?

yes, i chatted about this before and was told to call margin on the phone, i did and the guy was a general help but not specific to why i called, he said to use cash to make the trade. i did, and now i clearly have enough to buy the option, but still have no buying power in the error... why is this so?? and if i deposit more money why is it a week to ten days to effect? the money is out of the account and in yours in a day, the rest is unacceptable.

Fidelity: 

I should clarify in technical support I do not have knowledge of the reasons the buying power is not enough.

ok

Fidelity: 

That is a topic our trading representatives need to discuss.

Fidelity: 

Then can also clarify the cash movement issue.

Fidelity: 

So would you like to chat with them?

New party ('Linda Donahue') has joined the session

Fidelity: 

Good morning! Thank you for contacting Fidelity Investments. Give me a moment while I catch up.

ok...

Fidelity: 

Okay. So I see that you have cash coming in but little purchase buying power. Let me dig a little further. One moment.

""Error:(313111) The Estimated Order Value for this order exceeds your Buying Power. Buying Power takes into consideration any open orders that would impact your buying power if executed.""

yes, i do not like this setup, i have three other brokerage accounts and this is the only one that holds for this long; this will cost me in the long run and ill probably pull out.  without established balance deposited ten days in advance, and waiting another week to cure sells and gains, the account would be useless while waiting. this is an awful consumer approach and the bottom of all of my experience. i could have closed my option cheaper yesterday, and now the option is closing in at the strike.

Fidelity: 

So I am seeing this is a new relatively new account. When you bring funds in through EFT you are able to use those funds immediately in most situations. I see that you transferred 5000.00 and then bought AMC for $4910.40.

yes, then i transferred 50.00 to close the option because i had no access to the remainer of the previous funds. but... thatll probably be another week.  ameritrade, robin hood, and webull do instant cash use.

Fidelity: 

Then sold an a call for $54.31. And then transferred in 50.00. So...

i mean, its not like the deposit hasnt arrived yet

Fidelity: 

that leaves, let me do the math. One moment.

but selling a call is a deposit, not a withdrawl.

Fidelity: 

So that leaves a balance of $193.91. Which is correct. You've used most of your $5,050 in cash to buy and sell leaving $193.91.

Fidelity: 

So you've used the money and it hasn't even collected fully yet.

i dont know what math your using; buying back the option is 29.00. there's not 29.00?

Fidelity: 

One moment.

Fidelity: 

When you try and buy it back are you choosing type margin to do it in? Because the shares of AMC and the call are both held in type margin.

no i tried cash, where the balance is. margin was the last call to customer service where they told me it didnt work because i have to use cash until the cash clears in over one trading week. also, i was told the AMC can not be marginable.

i can try margin and see...

Fidelity: 

okay. Try that.

no... same error as expected

Error:(313111) The Estimated Order Value for this order exceeds your Buying Power. Buying Power takes into consideration any open orders that would impact your buying power if executed.

I do not like Fidelity trading

I am unable to see a previous chat. I apologize you were disconnected, but if you wouldn't mind restating your concern we can get started.

i have bee trying to close my option, i deposited enough cash to do so today because of the errors i keep getting from yesterday. there is an account problem that no one can solve where i have to use of deposited funds until i wait over a trading week. even though they assurred me funds are available to use before it settles. it is not. you are the fourth person this week to handle this... lets see.

the close is like 14.00 :/

Fidelity: 

Thanks, let me take a look at that for you.

Fidelity: 

Reaching out to another team to take a look as well, thanks for your patience!

any luck? and this isnt just options... your cash settlement policy is for any gains, deposits, or trades. i came here because ameritrade has its issues but none of them are this; this is much worse.

no one would deposit funds and agree to wait six trading days to operate each transaction

Fidelity: 

They confirmed we can place the trade for you and waive any commission since the funds not being fully settled is what's preventing the order online.

look, if i have to wait for each deposit, option premium, or trade to settle 5-6 trade days and thats your platform... I will go somewhere else.

Fidelity: 

If the security you are looking to trade is under $3 then the trade has to be made with settled funds. For any other position the funds are available immediately.

Fidelity: 

Were you looking to close the option at market or did you have a specific price in mind?

the deposit i first made will clear monday the 17th, it was made on friday i believe

the trade is not less than 3$

the rep that was helping me b4 you could not even add math

did you guys come from robinhood?

Fidelity: 

Did you want to place the trade today?

im very upset, i have three other brokerage accounts and this one is the worst.

Fidelity: 

The security is trading for less that $3.

how? it says 14.00 now

oh i see, you're not looking at the contract, youre looking at the p er share price

you do realize that fidelity is the only firm with this policy

Fidelity: 

Correct, the $3 applies to the share price.

never mind, let it ride out, its over soon, and ill pull out after monday. good day

**Information shown in the table is based on the aggregate number of orders entered by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC self-directed retail customers ""as of"" the date and time shown. Recent News headlines are ""as of"" the date indicated on the full story. Each customer may have a different reason for buying or selling a security. This information provides you with only some information about customer's sentiments. It should not be the sole basis for making an investment decision. Securities listed are not recommended or endorsed by Fidelity and are displayed for informational purposes only. Fidelity strongly encourages each investor to review and research their investments to ensure they align with the investor's personal investment objectives and risk profile.**  


Here are today's listings. The 2nd col is buy orders, the 3rd col is sell orders. I personally don't care if people are buying or selling. Just looking at ""active interest""  


What I was suprised by is that the total # of orders is fairly large (again, I pruned out the small number of ETFs in the list, so there's not 30 like Fidelity lists on their page)  
AUUD and MRIN are the crazy squeeze that's been happening recently.  


So there's 162K orders here (buy+sell). Fidelity says they are from ""**Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC self-directed retail customers ""**  


Elsewhere, Fidelity reports 3.5 million average trades per day, in Q1 2021   
[https://www.fidelity.com/about-fidelity/our-company/quarterly-updates/quarterlyupdates-q1-2021](https://www.fidelity.com/about-fidelity/our-company/quarterly-updates/quarterlyupdates-q1-2021)  


So this is a surprisingly small sample of all trades that Fidelity handles per day. Is it the so-called ""dumb money"" ? :)  


The 3.5M trades/day number has a \*\* that says ""*\*Includes commissionable and non-commissionable trades for retail and institutional brokerage.""*

2021-06-03,“Settled” cash gets unsettled after subsequent deposit,"“Settled” cash gets unsettled after subsequent deposit I’ve noticed that if I make a deposit for say $500, it’ll take a few days to settle and then I might make a trade for say, $200 with it. I’ll then be left with $300 in my “settled cash balance”. Normal so far. But then, if I decide to deposit another $500, the $200 that was already settled and in my settled cash balance becomes like it’s not settled anymore, and I’ll see $700 in unsettled balance and $0 in settled cash. 

Even more annoying, even the stocks I already purchased with my “settled” cash seems to get unsettled with a new deposit after. Yesterday morning I bought a stock using cash in my settled balance, but I made a deposit a little later that afternoon (also reducing whatever was left in my settled balance to 0 of course), and this morning when I tried to sell that stock, it tried telling me it was unsettled and it’d give me a good faith violation. But if I bought the stock originally with settled cash, I thought I could sell it whenever I wanted and not have to wait for settling again?

Is there a reason for this, really annoying how my already settled cash gets unsettled just because I decide to put more money in. Shouldn’t only the new deposit have to settle, and the stuff that was already settled stay settled? I’m also mainly using the iOS app if that makes a difference.",-0.5550287365913391,Negative,English
2021-06-01,Will Fidelity Refund Transfer Fees Multiple Times?,"Will Fidelity Refund Transfer Fees Multiple Times? Last week I did a partial account transfer from Robinhood into Fidelity which Fidelity **royally** fucked up. I requested to transfer a bunch of options contracts, and instead they transferred shares of the same symbol.

The issue ended up being a bug with their transfer request form (if you select ""options"" and then ""transfer all contracts"" and enter the symbol via the GUI, when the GUI fills out the transfer form, it doesn't know you selected ""options"", CS said you have to list out each option individually - selecting ""options"" and ""all contracts"" doesn't actually do anything), but in short, they didn't really seem very apologetic about it, which pisses me off because not only did this bug cause them to fuck up the transfer request, but I had to spend an hour of my time trying to get them to resolve the issue, plus they didn't seem interested in fixing the bug (which I get, a CS agent has enough on their plate, they don't want to open a ticket for a bug report)

After spending about an hour on the phone with them (including hold time), they told me that I had to initiate a new transfer request - which isn't really a problem, but the only potential issue is that Robinhood charges a $75 fee for each transfer request.

The options I requested to transfer are currently worth about 100k.

I asked the CS agent if they will cover the transfer fee for the new transfer (because this was a mistake on their part) and she said ""I don't know if they will."" (I'm thinking, are you *kidding* me?)

I know Fidelity has a policy that they will refund transfer fees for assets over a certain amount (I think $25k), but my question is, do they typically refund transfer fees **FOR EACH** transfer over $25k? Or is it a ""one-per-person"" kind of thing. Like will they say ""we already refunded your first transfer, so we can't refund your second transfer"" even though it will be well above the threshold.",0.0,Neutral,English

I just got off the phone with fidelity support to confirm that they haven't received anything and they said the last update from Robinhood was the actual transfer of shares in March. I've entered some cost-basis info myself, but I had some recurring investments and really don't want to do the math on all those different lots over all my statements.

2021-05-05,The level one options trading permission is an absolute joke,"The level one options trading permission is an absolute joke Restricting options trading permissions to *only* covered calls is a wild way to price out retail investors from trading options.

A covered call is a limited profit, unlimited risk trade. It make sense only in very specific scenarios, and requires an excellent understanding of valuation and pricing. New options traders should be discouraged from these types of transactions, yet on Fidelity a level 1 permission allows you to make *only this specific trade*.

Additionally, the capital requirement for writing a covered call is excessive for any low risk security. All the tech blue chippers trade in the hundreds, and most of the Dow securities do as well. If I want to write an AAPL covered call, which I do, I would need $13k in capital. As a result, I'm now funneled into researching stocks with a low price per share simply to execute these trades in order to get level 2 permission. These trades will inherently be riskier than simply buying calls or puts (even accounting for the risk of assignment, since Fidelity knows they can liquidate my long positions and purchase whatever security I wrote the contract on).

I'm not sure if I should just be looking for a new broker that is better designed for options trading, but I'm shocked that this leveled permission system (which seemed like a good idea at first) is so poorly thought out.

It would make much more sense to permit level 1 users to buy calls and buy puts, but require their approved margin to exceed what would be necessary to cover the contract, as those trades don't have the unlimited risk that writing a contract does.

Am I crazy here? Also does anybody have an options platform reco that i should consider, or is Fidelity good for options?",0.0,Neutral,English

Monday I call and get someone about 2 hours later and I'm told that antifraud has froze my account and needs me to fax them DL and bank statement. State they cannot disclose why they froze the account. I couldn't get the transfer haulted so my money is in limbo and my bank wont do anything after I asked them for advice. So I am a little irritated but ok whatever. I send what they want but on the bank statement I took a marker to deposits/balance ect. My name,address,acct info all clearly eligible. No response and this is at the peak of GME first run so im bugging out and call them again. They keep asking to record a voice print and they say they need an unredacted copy and no I'm not doing that. It's not thier buisness what I do with my money or how much is in the linked account.

 I'm having a hard time with this deal given now I am set up in around 11 stock and crypto exchanges with absolutely zero issues, and want to move that money over. I tried to transfer from another app and they won't release it. I sent complaints to the AG, SEC, FINRA, FTC and so far 1 reply where the company flat out lies in the statement they gave to the regulatory body's request for information denying I sent them my information at all. I'm losing sleep and they're generating interest off my money in the meantime. I've written so many letter and made god knows how many phone calls but I'm not getting far. I feel like they've wronged me on many levels and I don't know why because they won't say. So I'm wondering what kind of meta data they have on me and is this some kind of discrimination like racial or political. Never been in trouble with the law and have good credit. Besides the fact they took the money after they locked me out of the account....how fucked up is that. If they had a question of if I am really me then they shouldn't have processed it.

Statuette of limitations is about 2 years to pursue litigation and I really get stressed out about courts so I don't want to do that. Just dont know what to do. I guess I'm telling you as to maybe inform people of things that can happen when starting an account. And I'm open to advise or hearing if anyone else experienced this and how they got through it.",-0.7239187359809875,Negative,English

I was thinking about how great the govt economists are.

If we're going to have stim money, the best thing to do is to multiply it's effect.  
But the US govt doesn't really want to get involved in investing heavily in speculative securities.

Instead, we get the millenials to do it. With short term investing. So that if they win, the us govt gets a nice taste in tax return, because they do short term trades.  


If they lose, well, doesn't matter, their trades help pump the price on ""something"" ...so some other guy will make money, and the US govt should get the tax from that guy's trade.  


In short: pumping up the market in volatile stocks, is a good way for a small amount of money (stim money to  millenials) to increase tax revenue.

I provided the url for the Fidelity research page for each of the 50 stonks.  Is there any info at that url that is used before making a buy or sell?  Or, are stonks purely options vehicles, and other options research is the only thing useful?

Example: if you only looked at mid-caps from this stonk list on Fri, they were up 3.41% (6 stonks: GME PLUG NET PENN DKNG NOK).  Does one modify stonk-selection based on cap size?  Micros from that list were up 5.36% (4 stonks SNDL PETS CBD BNGO)

Or is it better to pick a symbol that sounds like a word? BNGO == Bingo? SUMO = Sumo wrestling? I assume CBD is a stonk purely because it's symbol reminds of cannabis, even though the company has nothing to with cannabis.

2021-03-08,Why is it such a nightmare to get options approved?,"Why is it such a nightmare to get options approved? Major complaint about fidelity. Why is it impossible to talk to a human adjuster and the decision maker and get approved?

Getting real tired of 2-3 hour phone calls just to be shuffled around and NOT get to talk to the right department, or of letting applications linger for a week.

I get they're busy because of the robin hood exodus, but it goes deeper.

I got told that the department responsible for approving/denying options applications has no means to talk with a customer directly. Like, at all.

Two questions:
Should I be making other brokerage accounts instead of getting the run around?
Is fidelity wealth-ist if you're not opening a high value account? Do they just not care if you don't have $bigmoney? Sure feels that way.


Edit:3-9-2021: Thanks everyone for your response! I'm GLAD it isn't just me! I would urge everyone struggling with options applications to apply to the trifecta of federal regulators and see how that helps. Helpful links are here:

2021-03-04,How I got transferred from Robinhood to Fidelity in 4 business days,"How I got transferred from Robinhood to Fidelity in 4 business days Hi friends, a lot of you have probably seen me answering questions or goofing around the forum. I managed to get my Robinhood account transferred over to Fidelity in just four business days. I began the transfer on Monday and it finished on Thursday (sans some minor details like my cost basis).

I wanted to impart the knowledge I gained on my journey to this point and thank everybody here for answering questions and posting tips and stuff. I figured I can put everything here for future generations of angry Robinhood users lol.

Okay so here's how I did this.

**Step 1 - Prepare your Fidelity account**

So obviously, I don't just mean opening an account. I mean getting your banks set up, getting the app(s) set up, and making sure your account is unlocked to the extent that you want. For instance, I know you have to accept an agreement to see after hours stuff and I did have to call Fidelity CS, who fiddled and did something with my account to enable real-time quotes in the mobile app.

The reason you want to do this is to avoid having to do it later after your shares show up. Robinhood isn't going down next week so you have the time. But, my national bank chain was ready immediately in Fidelity and my credit union took almost 2 weeks (and 2 phone calls). I did have to call a couple of times to get after hours and pre-market trading set-up and ask questions about what I could and could not do.

In any case, by the time I started my transfer, my entire Fidelity account was ready to accept it. I tested cash deposits to see how long they take (in like $5-$10 increments) and bought some hilarious penny stock (HCMC lol, less than 1 cent!) just to get a feel for everything and ask questions if needed. You should do this BEFORE you transfer your entire portfolio so there are no surprises. Plus, I fully believe your account needs to be fully set up before you can do step 2.

**Step 2 - Convert to (and learn about) a Fidelity margin account**

Margin accounts are very different from cash accounts. The reason this step is important is because your Robinhood account is a margin account by default. That's part of the reason they can give you instant access to your deposits and how you can do basically whatever you want, despite the fact that stocks take forever to do anything. Robinhood doesn't tell you this, but it's what gives you that level of ""freedom"" to do ""whatever you want"". Plus, you don't have to worry about Good Faith Violations anymore, instead you gotta avoid being marked as a Pattern Day Trader. The joys of trading.

But here's the thing, transferring a margin account (Robinhood) to a cash account (Fidelity) is time consuming. Robinhood and Fidelity have to transfer shares over, but they also have to convert your assets from margin to non-margin. This has to happen if going from margin to non-margin accounts and it takes some time (especially if Robinhood has to do it).

To prevent what will be a couple of days worth of delay, go onto Fidelity's website (or call them) and enable margins on your account. **BE CAREFUL WITH THIS** because Fidelity doesn't hold your hand like Robinhood does and margin is, in essence, borrowing money (that you have to pay back one way or another).

However, by making your Fidelity account margin, it makes the transfer of your margin assets from Robinhood much faster since no conversion needs to take place. Once the transfer completes, you can manually convert them (and your account) back to cash with Fidelity (call in and ask a rep to do it) and remove the margin part of it without your shares being stuck in limbo.

tl'dr, you basically want the same features operational in both Fidelity and Robinhood before you transfer. This also extends to options if you have options in Robinhood. This prevents one or both companies from needing to convert assets before delivery, which takes extra time.

**Step 3 - Prepare Robinhood**

This part took some self control. Bank deposits settle in Robinhood in 3-4 business days (not instantly as they would have you believe). Every stock trade requires T+2 days to settle (industry standard). Plus, there is a $75 fee to transfer out of Robinhood.

Before I transferred, I made sure to have $75 (I actually had like $300, but you want at least $75) in cash in my account to cover the transfer fee. Then I made sure to sell off my fractional shares because Robinhood is going to do that for you if you don't do it yourself and it adds time to the transfer process. Finally, I made sure everything in my account was settled. My bank transfers were done, my stock trades were settled, etc etc.

Ideally, you want no fractional shares, $75 in there for Robinhood to eat when it transfers you out, and for no trades/deposits/withdrawals to be ""in progress"". Robinhood doesn't tell you about the T+2 rule so it's up to you to keep track of when your last trades were.

Each and every one of these steps will decrease the delay during the transfer process. Robinhood will perform all those steps for you if you don't do them and each step adds time (and complexity) to the transfer process.

**Final bit of advice**

My strategy here was to have as little downtime as humanly possible in case something went awry. However, I also balked for a long time because I was (was, keyword) a Workhorse stock holder and I knew the USPS contract was coming very soon. I did not want my stocks stuck in limbo in case WKHS didn't get the contract so I could bail out...which is exactly what happened. Make sure you plan your escape around a big bit of news. If your stock has big news right around the corner, I'd maybe wait until after that news so you don't screw yourself.

In any case, once my Fidelity account was ready (and on margin) and my Robinhood account was all settled with no fractional shares and stuff, I initiated my transfer Monday and I woke up Thursday to all my shares in Fidelity. Your mileage may vary, but that's the route I took. 4 business days later, and I think what I did made a difference.

Hope that helps someone. (This isn't financial advice, btw, just a guide on how I setup my stuff and made my transfer as short as possible lol.)

**One more thing**

This should also work when transferring stocks to and from anywhere. It should work going from Ameritrade to Fidelity, Robinhood to Webull, Webull to E\*Trade, whatever. None of these concepts are unique to just Fidelity or Robinhood. It's just a matter of common sense.

2021-03-03,Fidelity issued me a $33K Margin call for making a $50 day trade. After 2 hours with customer service they couldn't explain why the call was so high and asked me to call back tomorrow. Does anyone here have any insight?,"Fidelity issued me a $33K Margin call for making a $50 day trade. After 2 hours with customer service they couldn't explain why the call was so high and asked me to call back tomorrow. Does anyone here have any insight? I have a rollover IRA with Fidelity that (after today's shitty market activity) is worth about $80k, but was worth $90k on Feb 23rd when all this crap went down. At that time I had $831.2 of settled cash, and that morning I got a message saying that previous restriction (which had prevented me from using limited margin) came off the account. I stupidly thought that meant that I could use margin, and since it was a pretty bad day in the markets I traded a bit more actively than I normally would have.  


I used the $831.2 of settled cash to buy (as a cash transaction) some options, sold some shares in various securities to generate cash, and then made the rest of my trades that day on margin (unless I'm a complete moron, that's the entire point of margin), specifically choosing the ""Margin"" option when placing the trades.  


By the end of the day I had bought $4552.55 worth of stock and options, and had sold $11,840.89 cents of stock and options. Unfortunately I made the mistake of day trading a lot of 5 SPY put options (created a debit spread, and bought back half of the short leg later in the day). The cost of buying back those 5 SPY put options was $50.   


The next morning I woke up to a Day Trade Call of $32,913.80. I spent over two hours on the phone with two different reps from Fidelity, trying to understand how the Day Trade Call was so large. Nobody could explain why and by the time they told me that there was an ""active trader services"" that I could talk to that office was closed so I have to call back tomorrow.  


In my experience Reddit is often more knowledgeable than customer service drones, so maybe you guys can help me understand how in the world $4.5k worth of margin trading could generate a $32,913.80 Day Trade Call, and what that even means? From what I can tell I'm not even really using margin since I sold more than I bought, I'm just buying on margin so I don't have to wait around for the settlement, but it's not like I'm taking on debt. Why does Fidelity want me to liquidate 1/3rd of my account? What could the point of that possibly be? I'm not even putting any of their money at risk.

I've been using Fidelity for about 6 years for a Roth IRA and 529 plans - pretty benign. I decided to use them to purchase a few GME shares just for fun. I did this in the evening, and bought at market price the next day. Fidelity covered the difference as the price had gone up in pre-market. I did not realize they would do that, but it was my fault for not understanding the tools.

This morning before market open I get an e-mail that 4 of my 9 shares have been sold, with no explanation as to why. When I logged into my account, I see it is to cover the debt to them for about $150 from the original GME trade. I did know about this debt, however I was a little surprised that they both sold shares rather than pulling from an attached bank account, and also that they didn't e-mail me when that money was due to them. They obviously have my e-mail address since I was notified of the trade, but I never heard a peep of that money being due (or that they'd sell shares to get it) via e-mail. This is the first time I've ever bought individual stocks so perhaps it should have been understood that any money they front was due immediately, but it caught me off guard that they would sell without prior warning. Their customer service has been very difficult to get ahold of since before the game stop craziness so I haven't been able to get anyone on the phone.

I've been using their web portal for everything, so the issue was that the way in which I was trying to place trades was not allowing me to trade from my cash buying power, instead defaulting to my margin buying power (which was $0 as my funds are still being settled).

In order to place a trade using your cash buying power, you have to go to the main Portfolio screen, then select ""Trade"" at the top left in black. This opens a pop-up trading box. In this box you have the option to change ""Trade Type"" to Cash. Then you can place the trades you want using your cash balance.

Fidelitys mobile apps user interface is terrible. Worst in class? Id honestly give it a strong maybe.

Now before you get offended by this post, i totally understand that Fidelity is a big boy broker and its time for us to put on our big boy pants.

That being said, we do live in a world where the average user is very phone savvy and they are used to dealing with interfaces that are much more streamlined and “intuitive”.

The Fidelity app, i am sad to say, acknowledges none of these things.

For the love of god, please update the app!

2021-02-05,Is there a way to see after market prices reflected in watchlist/account view?,"Is there a way to see after market prices reflected in watchlist/account view? Hello,  after a few days of messing around (and calling customer  support...twice), I managed to turn on after hours and pre-market  trading as well as real time quote prices through the app (the first  requires a phone call to activate, the second is supposed to be in the  app but I guess the CSR I talked to un-screwed something because mine  wouldn't show before the call).

So  with both, I want to see the prices change in real-time during after  hours trading like I do during active hours. So far I have been unable  to do so.

As far as I know, the only two ways to check the price of a stock after hours is to:

1. Look  at the Bid x Size under the Quote Details portion.  Usually the Bid x Size is pretty close to trade price (less than 0.5%  difference), but it's not exact all the time.
2. Hitting  the green ""Trade"" button, and then hitting the ""Extended Hours Trading""  toggle to on shows me the price as of the moment I hit the toggle, but I  must un-toggle and re-toggle the option to get a price update.

I  don't intend on trading pre/after market very often and I understand  that movement is generally slow enough to not matter much most of the time, but I do like  to watch just in case something crazy happens (I have Workhorse, a stock that is known for dropping and raising $5 at a time for no reason). Is there any way to have the app stream the prices (like  Robinhood and several other brokerages), so am I up the proverbial creek  without a proverbial paddle?

The  way the system works isn't so bad, but I have to go all the way to the  trade page to see the after market stuff and I feel like there should be a way to see that straight from the watchlist view or even the quote.  My portfolio also doesn't show value based on after market activity and  sits at the 4PM closing value, even if it's gone up or down since then.

Honestly,  Fidelity needs an overhaul for this app in general (the battery drain, antiquated UI/UX, the biometric login issues, etc), but I feel like there's no reason  to be able to trade after hours if the app doesn't show me after hours  prices unless I dive several pages down into the app to even temporarily  see it.

This is my very last ""ugh this app gives me a headache"" issue. Everything else has been fixed/resolved to an extent where I'm happy enough until the app devs wake up and realize that bottom-of-the-screen nav buttons and page swiping are a thing now that they severely need to use (at this point I'd be happy for a carbon copy of E\*Trade's app since its redesign).

Bonus:

If there is no other way to view after market prices easily, what would you all recommend I use instead so I can keep up with what's going on after hours? I use Yahoo Finance and it does the job sorta, but I've never tried like [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) or other, similar apps. Any recommendations to help shore up this weakness would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",0.0,Neutral,English

After getting the account set up, I tried to link my bank account for EFT, but the request was denied because for some reason my account was “closed”. 

After waiting for nearly 2 hours on hold, I got on the phone with a customer service rep, who informed me that some of the information they needed for my account to be fully operational was missing. I don’t know why they didn’t ask me for this information when I first opened the account, but I was just happy that I finally knew what was wrong. 

I sent all the info that was needed via secure email on 1/30, and I immediately got a notification via email that Fidelity would send a secure email response within 24-48 hours (M-F) of the moment I sent the initial secure email. 

It’s now been nearly 96 business hours, and I’ve yet to receive a response. Is this normal right now, due to the high influx of new traders and transferees from RH?

I really want to stick with Fidelity because they offer fractional shares, and I’m starting off with a very small amount of cash. But after over 6 weeks of waiting, I’m getting very impatient, and I’m tempted to just go sign up with another broker like Schwab or TD Ameritrade.",0.0,Neutral,English

Fidelity is now saying the transfer is complete. It's impossible to talk to a person at Fidelity right now, unfortunately (support line is on hold forever). A few problems--

*One of my holdings transferred the full holding, but another only transferred one of the two shares. So there's a share of a holding worth >$300 still in a deactivated Robinhood account

*The cash left over from the sale of fractional shares in Robinhood did not transfer (>$700).

*There's a note on the shares that transferred that reads ""margin."" But I never bought shares on margin from Robinhood. The closest to that is that Robinhood would let me instantly buy shares after starting a transfer, but the last purchase I made settled its transfer before the Fidelity transfer was initiated. I noticed another poster in this subreddit saying that they also had $1000 of margin placed on their Robinhood account, despite not buying shares on margin.

*Also, I'm being charged a $75 fee for the transfer, which I understand is standard but sometimes Fidelity might waive the fee. I've asked Fidelity to waive it.

I haven’t bought or sold stock in the last month. After the transfer finished all my stock transferred but five thousand dollars were transfer to Robinhood and I still have that five thousand dollar margin debit on Fidelity.

So basically Robinhood pulled a 5 thousand margin loan from Fidelity.

He said they have no idea what is going on. He told me to wait until Friday to see if Robinhood does anything else on their end and then call again. He also told me to contact Robinhood to see if they can give me any insight on what is going on.

They say this is something they are doing to all Roth accounts with limited margin.  This is the latest of several explanations given, so I'm not sure whether it is really the reason.

2021-01-17,Fidelity closed my Roth IRA acc and won’t return my $3500,"Fidelity closed my Roth IRA acc and won’t return my $3500 Fidelity investment has refused to return my money after they (fidelity) closed my account without any warning or notice and within 6 days of opening the account. I opened the account when I was abroad and deposited money into the account then. I contacted them to know the reason for closing the account, they won’t tell me. I have contacted them severally about how to retrieve my money then and they tell me the same thing “ask your bank to retrieve the money”. I filed a claim with my bank on the money, and it was denied because I had an agreement with @fidelity to withdraw the money. I spoke to a Fidelity Investments manager on the phone yesterday and they told me there is nothing they can do from their side to return my money to me. I don’t understand why they can’t do anything or return my money when my money is in a fidelity account that was closed. This is fraudulent and shouldn’t be legal. 

As a ICU Nurse, every penny of that $3500 was painfully made, 12-15 awake every night, and i could have died making that money being that I am at the forefront of covid-19 pandemic.

This is fraudulent and should be illegal. If @fidelity must close my account, they have the right to. But what they don’t have the right to is to keep my hard earned money and try to scam me of $3500. As a financial institution, the responsible thing to do is to return your customers funds (through check or to their bank) once their account is closed. This is not legal.  I just need my money back so that I can continue to take care of my family.

Please I need suggestions on how to go about this and things I can do to get my $3500 back. These are hard times.",0.0,Neutral,English

At this point, I'm mostly looking for inputs on how to simplify it and speed it up.

It still needs features such as taking trading fees and slippage into account, but first I want to make the core work better.

Current performance on my Lenovo T450s: Going through 1800 stocks over 5 years of daily data takes 8 minutes.

Edit 1: sorry for the bad readability here. It is much cleaner to read on Github: [https://github.com/hollowheights/Backtesting](https://github.com/hollowheights/Backtesting)  
Edit 2: If you want to run this yourself, you can just delete/comment out the part about SQLite connection (local database) and set ""stocklist"" to ie. \[""AAPL"", ""MSFT""\]

So I've seen a few posts already from our users that have linked our open-source trading framework `Blankly`. We think the excitement around our code is really cool, but I do want to introduce us with a larger post. I want this to be informational and give people an idea about what we're trying to do.

There are some great trading packages out there like Freqtrade and amazing integrations such as CCXT - why did we go out and create our own?

- Wanted a more flexible framework. We designed blankly to be able to easily support existing strategies. We were working with a club that had some existing algorithmic models, so we had to solve the problem of how to make something that could be backtestable and then traded live but also flexible enough to support almost existing solution. Our current framework allows existing solutions to use the full feature set as long as **A) the model uses price data from blankly** and **B) the model runs order execution through blankly**.
- Iterate faster. A blankly model (given that the order filter is checked) can be instantly switched between stocks and crypto. A backtestable model can also immediately be deployed.
- Could the integrations get simpler? CCXT and other packages do a great job with integrations, but we really tried to boil down all the functions and arguments that are required to interact with exchanges. The current set is easy to use but also (should) capture the actions that you need. Let us know if it doesn't. The huge downside is that we're re-writing them all :(.
- Wanted to give more power to the user. I've seen a lot of great bots that you make a class that inherits from a `Strategy` object. The model development is then overriding functions from that parent class. I've felt like this limits what's possible. Instead of blankly giving you functions to override, we've baked all of our flexibility to the functions that you call.
- Very accurate backtests. The whole idea of blankly was that the backtest environment and the live environment are the same. This involves checking things allowed asset resolution, minimum/maximum percentage prices, minimum/maximum sizes, and a few other filters. Blankly tries extremely hard to force you to use the exchange order filters in the backtest, or the order will not go through. This can make development more annoying, but it gives me a huge amount of confidence when deploying.
- We wanted free websocket integrations


## Example

This is a profitable RSI strategy that runs on Coinbase Pro

```python
import blankly


def price_event(price, symbol, state: blankly.StrategyState):
    """""" This function will give an updated price every 15 seconds from our definition below """"""
    state.variables['history'].append(price)
    rsi = blankly.indicators.rsi(state.variables['history'])
    if rsi[-1] < 30 and not state.variables['owns_position']:
        # Dollar cost average buy
        buy = int(state.interface.cash/price)
        state.interface.market_order(symbol, side='buy', size=buy)
        # The owns position thing just makes sure it doesn't sell when it doesn't own anything
        # There are a bunch of ways to do this
        state.variables['owns_position'] = True
    elif rsi[-1] > 70 and state.variables['owns_position']:
        # Dollar cost average sell
        curr_value = int(state.interface.account[state.base_asset].available)
        state.interface.market_order(symbol, side='sell', size=curr_value)
        state.variables['owns_position'] = False


def init(symbol, state: blankly.StrategyState):
    # Download price data to give context to the algo
    state.variables['history'] = state.interface.history(symbol, to=150, return_as='deque')['close']
    state.variables['owns_position'] = False


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    # Authenticate coinbase pro strategy
    exchange = blankly.CoinbasePro()

    # Use our strategy helper on coinbase pro
    strategy = blankly.Strategy(exchange)

    # Run the price event function every time we check for a new price - by default that is 15 seconds
    strategy.add_price_event(price_event, symbol='BTC-USD', resolution='1d', init=init)
    
    # Start the strategy. This will begin each of the price event ticks
    # strategy.start()
    # Or backtest using this
    results = strategy.backtest(to='1y', initial_values={'USD': 10000})
    print(results)
```

And here are the results:

https://imgur.com/a/OKwtebN

Just to flex the ability to iterate a bit, you can change `exchange = blankly.CoinbasePro()` to `exchange = blankly.Alpaca()` and of course `BTC-USD` to `AAPL` and everything adjusts to run on stocks.

You can also switch `stratgy.backtest()` to `strategy.start()` and the model goes live.

We've been working super hard on this since January. I'm really hoping people like it.

I'm currently tracking a little over 500 equities and a few indexes by sampling the bid, ask, volume, and open interest every 5 minutes from public data sources. I just put together a website where I'm planning to host a bunch of different datasets. Here's the website, [https://signals.dev/](https://signals.dev/) (feedback welcome).

The data is best effort so there could be mistakes or errors but should be accurate enough to incorporate into some models. I started recording data since September 1st, though the first day of data is a bit wonky as I was still tweaking things.

The data is zipped and in a CSV format, sample below. I've been recording this for my own purposes but figured I'd share to see if others want this too. I'm thinking about offering a paid subscription for the full dataset but haven't decided on anything yet (currently around 50GB per month uncompressed in CSV format). Anyways, enjoy. Planning to gather more datasets I find interesting, suggestions welcome.

Hi everyone, a while ago I posted about my mean reversion trading setup: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/pmzdzr/my\_mean\_reversion\_trading\_strategy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/pmzdzr/my_mean_reversion_trading_strategy/)

I have posted this on other sites but I figure that many of you have extremely specialized knowledge on coding, statistics, and TA, so even though this isn't an alog, I wanted to see if I found some responses here!

I have since made some slight changes to this setup but it is essentially still the same. I have had A LOT of success with this setup. It is extremely good at predicting tops in the forex markets and I use the leverage to profit off of small moves - again it has been immensely successful.

I am now looking to improve this setup even further. What sets this setup apart is its reliance on statistics. Specifically linear regression, standard deviation, and mean deviation. Sadly, I am not the best with thinkscript and am also not extremely knowledgeable about statistics outside of the ones mentioned. That being said, I wanted to know if anyone could help me with any of the following:

\- Generally, what would you add to my setup to make it better. Seriously, anything.

\- For people familiar with statistics, what are some other methods that I could use to find when a data set is overextended? Generally, what other statistical methods would you recommend I try to incorporate to help improve this?

\- For traders, what are some overbought/oversold indicators that you think could make this strategy better? I've looked all over the internet and cannot find any obscure or rarely used OB/OS indicators, it's mostly just RSI, stochastics, etc. What mean reversion studies would you recommend?

\- Literally anything else you can think of that might make this better, any idea, anything else would be greatly appreciated.

If you give me a good idea, I will share my setup code with you (I have already done this with someone else). Feel free to comment or message, I will respond to either. Thanks!",0.0,Neutral,English

2021-09-29,How to set up schema for my own OHLCV stock and crypto database with InfluxDB?,"How to set up schema for my own OHLCV stock and crypto database with InfluxDB? I have 15 years of intra-day OHLCV data which I want to store in my local machine with InfluxDB (I am new to it!) for retail algo trading research purposes and I would love to seek your advices.

For those not familiar with InfluxDB terminologies, you may refer to this document: [https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/).

I have think of two approaches:

1.) Put everything into the same **organsiation** 'tradedata' which contains a 'stock' **bucket** and a 'crypto' **bucket.** Then in the 'stock' **bucket**, it will contain different **database** named in tickers ie 'aapl' then the **measurement**  for each of these **databases** would be all be 'price' with **field** **set** set to be 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', and 'volume' respectively with a 'source' indicating source of data as a **tag** for each **point** at a frequency of 1min between each **point**.

2.) Put everything into the same **organsiation** 'tradeprices'. Then in the 'stock' **bucket**, it will contain three **databases** named '1m', '15m' and '1h', which containing OHLCV data at different frequencies. At each **database**, the **measurement** for each of these database would be tickers ie. 'aapl', 'msft' 'btc\_eth'... with **field** **set** set to be 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', and 'volume' respectively with a **tag set** of 'source' indicating source of data and 'type' indicating whether it is stock or crypto  for each **point**.

Do you mind sharing your thoughts on them particularly which one is better for what purposes? My research mainly focus on using on two areas: (1). deep reinforcement learning algo trading (2). news sentiment analysis. I also plan to store some news data in either a seperate organisation or within the same organisation but under different bucket.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-09-23,Tradingview Trading Bot,"Tradingview Trading Bot Hi all,

I'm hoping somebody with more experience or who has encountered the same problems as I have is able to help me! 

I'm new to coding/algo trading so any pointers would be greatly appreciated! 

**Context:** I'm trying to automate a very simple trading system that relies on a Pinescript strategy in Tradingview to trade Nasdaq futures (NQ) and I'm currently facing a few challenges.  

The pinescript strategy sends alerts via webhook to my code (Python/Flask) which then submits orders to the broker. I already have a functioning bot for a separate strategy to trade crypto on my Binance account that's set up in exactly this way. The webhook is hosted on Heroku and the setup is pretty neat. The process was quite simple as I just hardcoded the API key and API secret into a configuration file. I'm looking to set a bot up in the same way but to trade NQ futures. 

 I'm in Australia, will be trading 1 contract a time, 10m timeframe, average of 1-2 trades per day submitted via market orders. The strategy doesn't require super high latency, I'm not doing HFT or anything, but for best results, the order should be triggered in <20s from signal alert. 

&#x200B;

>**IBKR** 

Seeing as though IBKR is the most competitive in terms of pricing and product offering, it was the natural first choice of broker. However, I've encountered multiple issues with each of their API options:

1. **TWS API -** TWS is too clunky, slow and needs to be running to accept orders via API. The TWS API also seems just way too unncessarily convoluted and there's too much functionality for what I need (which is to very simply submit market orders for 1 specific contract) and because of this, it uses so much compute power unnecessarily. 
2. **IB Gateway API -** Their ""headless"" gateway isn't much better and it isn't really truly headless as it still needs to be running in the background, so I still face the following issue: Both TWS and GW have daily server resets which cause disruptions in terms of re-authenticating automatically. From what I've seen on threads, some people have also had this issue whilst others haven't so it doesn't seem to very reliable. I need my authentication to be secure and reliable so that I never miss a trade due to authentication, so TWS and IB GW aren't great options for my use case.
3. **Client Portal Web API -** This API was supposed to be my saviour since it seems straightforward and uses a simple RESTful API, similar to Binance, and after dealing with TWS & IB GW and wasting countless hours trying to figure out their outdated systems and APIs, I still encountered other issues to my disappointment. This API is still in Beta so maybe that's why but I've found it to be super unreliable, bugging out half the time when I submit requests. On top of this, IBKR still requires me to authenticate a session in order to submit requests. This means I STILL need to have something running in the background to authenticate. Thanks to Voyz/Ibeam ([https://github.com/Voyz/ibeam](https://github.com/Voyz/ibeam)) I was able to authenticate with IBKR very simply without having to go through a massive run around myself as the CP Web API requires Java to authenticate for some reason ([https://interactivebrokers.github.io/cpwebapi/](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/cpwebapi/)), and I'm really only barely familiar with Python at the moment, BUT even then, IBKR's server seems to be super unreliable; it'll be fine and authenticated for some time but then bug out and disconnect.  I don't believe this is because of Ibeam - it must be IBKR because I made sure not to change anything while testing. When I contacted API support over the phone, they said the API endpoint/server wasn't available on the weekend, which partially explained the ""outage"" but then the next week it was totally fine on the weekend, but bugging out Mon-Wed. 

Hopefully somebody has gotten a similar trading system functioning and setup using the CP Web API without issues and I'm missing something? I'd much prefer to use the Web API as it's alot more straightforward but I seem to be having issues maintaining the authenticated session (using Ibeam). My plan was to then run this on a cloud server like AWS EC2. 

&#x200B;

>**Saxo Bank/Markets**

After not having much luck with IBKR and encountering multiple issues, I decided to look for alternatives. As I don't have a lot of options for trading Nasdaq futures from Australia, the next best broker I came across in terms of their API was Saxo. Whilst Saxo's API is a lot more modern and straightforward, I'm encountering a different problem, which hopefully somebody can help me with.

Saxo's API authentication follows the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It requires an ""access token"" to be sent with each POST request along with an account/client key. This would be PERFECT except for the fact that the access token expires and a refresh token is required in order to request a new access token. 

This means that I can't hard code the access token into a configuration file in my code. I'll have to somehow figure out how to make sure that my code always uses a new valid access token on each request, but I'm not sure how I'll code that in. 

I'm using the sample code in the link below to authenticate, but another thing is that this requires me to run the code in Python which opens the web browser, and I need to manually enter my log in credentials for SaxoTraderGO (Saxo's web trading platform), user ID and password, before the code flow can even be able to hit the authorisation server to request a refresh token & access token. 

Because of this, I can't use the exact same flow that I use with Binance (API Key & Secret coded into a config file). 

Does anyone know of a way to cater to this authentication code flow in my code in the simplest way possible? 

[https://github.com/SaxoBank/openapi-samples-python/blob/master/authentication/oauth/code-flow/bare-bones-code-flow-app.py](https://github.com/SaxoBank/openapi-samples-python/blob/master/authentication/oauth/code-flow/bare-bones-code-flow-app.py)

Saxo's developer API resources 

[https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/learn/writing-an-openapi-application](https://www.developer.saxo/openapi/learn/writing-an-openapi-application)

It also appears that Saxo offers multiple forms of authentication/security:

1. Authorisation code grant
2. Authorisation code grant (PKCE)
3. Certificate based authentication
4. Implicit flow 

I'm still trying to wrap my head around how this stuff works, so I'm not sure if one of the other options is easier or may work for my use case. Has anybody else had much experience with Saxo's API or these forms of authentication? I can't seem to find much else on other threads regarding Saxo. 

&#x200B;

>**Tradingview/Saxo integration**

This would be the most ideal and SIMPLEST option if possible, but it doesn't appear as though there's any way to create a bot directly on Tradingview that I've found. 

If only a strategy alert could automatically execute a trade on Saxo, this would make things sooo much easier and I wouldn't have to worry about all this complex coding.

**Final thoughts:**

If anybody has a solution to my problem, you will be my ultimate saviour. Or, perhaps there's another futures broker in Australia that I'm unaware of that has a very simple RESTful API with a simple API key & secret (similar to Binance)?

Any and all help is greatly appreciated!",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-09-03,Help with Backtrader,"Help with Backtrader I am in the process of evaluating backtraders and am currently looking at the BackTrader platform. I have run into some issues, however and their support site times out on registration and the reddit sub seems dead in the water. So I will pose my question here in the hopes someone will pick it up. If someone has a more appropriate suggestion for where to post please let me know.

**Question:**

I am trying to follow this tutorial whilst substituting in my own data file:

[https://www.backtrader.com/docu/quickstart/quickstart/](https://www.backtrader.com/docu/quickstart/quickstart/)

My data is a simple .to\_csv() save from a pandas data frame.

Here ia a data sample:

    datetime,open,high,low,close,volume
    2015-01-01 22:00:00,1.13112,1.13171,1.13072,1.13124,375.5599998533726

As you can see the data is sampled at 15 minute intervals.s

I am using this code to load in the csv:

&#x200B;

    data = bt.feeds.GenericCSVData(dataname=datapath,
                                      name='EURUSD',
                                      fromdate=datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 1),
                                      todate=datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 1),
                                      dtformat=""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"",
                                      datetime=0,
                                      time=-1,
                                      open=1, 
                                      high=2,
                                      low=3,
                                      close=4,
                                      volume=5,
                                      openinterest=-1,
        )

&#x200B;

I modified the sample code log function to output the time too:

        def log(self, txt, dt=None):
            ''' Logging function for this strategy'''
            bar_date = self.datas[0].datetime.date(0)
            bar_time = self.datas[0].datetime.time(0)
            dt = dt or f""{bar_date} {bar_time}""
            print(""{}, {}"".format(dt, txt))

When the sample code is run I get the following output:

    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12338
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12316
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12314
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12347
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12355
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12348
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12349
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12341
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12332
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12339
    2020-05-30 23:59:59.999989, Close, 1.12335

As you can see all the times are the same.

It seems that either the log function is not working or that the CSV parser is not loading the time in correctly.

1. Python vs. Compiled Language (C++ for example) in ETL land: When it comes to performance, it seems like it makes sense to use C++ for rest or web-socket connections.

If anyone could direct me to a starting place, it would be much appreciated.

On the order/volume of data extracted in real-time: If I assume some hypothetical system where only one data point can be viewed at a time, isn't there some sort of detrimental effect in processing one security bid before the other at a given time. I know this is probably more of an issue in HFT, but you would never be simultaneously processing quotes like you would when back-testing. Are big shops accounting for this?
3. On parallelism for requests/connections: Should I be creating threads/processes for each security request/subscription when pulling data? I'm new to the OS game, so please be gentle with this one. Do big shops have large multi-processing environments?

All in all, I am looking to up my game from my python rest api classes. Any additional advice for this would be greatly appreciated.",0.0,Neutral,English

2021-06-27,Searching for API w/ accurate intraday (hourly) stock volume + OHLC data,"Searching for API w/ accurate intraday (hourly) stock volume + OHLC data I've looked into Alpaca and IEXcloud, but found that the intraday volume is orders of magnitude off from its day volume (e.g., sum of all minute volume for AAPL on 6/25 returns \~1mil vs. the daily volume was \~75 mil). I'm guessing that's because IEX only keeps track of a % of all trades, but wonder if the data gets better if/when I start paying for the API. I also saw a TDameritrade post of how intraday volume summed up does not match its day volume. Have others encountered this kind of situation?  


A bit more context: I code in python and am trying to get off the yfinance train because of all its bugs.

2021-06-27,Leverage strategies for trading multiple symbols,"Leverage strategies for trading multiple symbols Let's say I want to trade 20 cryptocurrencies and I have a model that will identify long and short trading opportunities as they arise.

One simple portfolio management strategy would be to divide the total account by the number of currencies and effectively assign each currency to an equal portion of the account.  The upside to this is that it will prevent one currency from driving big drawdowns.  The major downside is that it will often result in a lot of idle cash.

Seemingly, the number of signals could vary greatly at different points in time based on market volatility or otherwise.  During times when there are fewer opportunities, it likely makes sense to allocate more towards a trade than what would be allocated for the basic proportional strategy, and during times of more frequent/simultaneous signals, an amount of leverage closer to the proportional strategy probably makes sense.

A handful of factors that come to mind for how to determine the leverage for a given trade are:

1. Total number of currencies in an existing trade
2. Whether existing trades are long or short or the extent to which the longs offset the shorts.  A more complex version of this (let's say for stocks), might involve calculating the correlation between symbols, but cryptocurrencies seem to have a high degree of positive correlation, so I think offsetting longs and shorts can be assumed to reduce the amount of variability in total returns.
3. Market volatility or relative volume.  It might make sense to reduce leverage during times of high volatility to avoid large drawdowns.

With cryptocurrencies, the fees are relatively high (compare Binance's fee of 0.075% on each side of the trade versus paying a $0.01 spread on AAPL stock), which is a disincentive against constant rebalancing and further complicates the process.  That is, if a period of few opportunities turns into a period of greater opportunities, it might make sense to let some of the larger, earlier positions ride simply to avoid excess trading fees.

Just curious if there are standard ways to approach this or if anyone has feedback or suggestions.

\-------------

EDIT: The fees issue noted at the end is really the driving factor here.  If trading costs were zero, it would probably be a simple calculation to determine the total exposure relative to account balance, adjust for market volatility as desired, and constantly rebalance.  The fact that rebalancing comes at a cost drives the need for leverage strategies that are more thoughtful than would otherwise be necessary.",0.0,Neutral,English
2021-06-25,Optimizing IBKR API TIme and Sales Extractions,"Optimizing IBKR API TIme and Sales Extractions Hi, 

I am trying to speed up the process of extraction tick data from the IBKR API, for those who do not use it:

([https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/historical\_time\_and\_sales.html](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/historical_time_and_sales.html))

\- I am trying to pull multiple full days of ticks for multiple ""contracts""

\- Each request only allows up to 1000 lines so for days with more than 1000 transactions on specific contracts I need to take the last available time as my start point

I know creating multiple data frames is very slow, is there a way around this? could I use Cython or Numba to speed this up? thanks.

This is what I have come up with:

    def fetch_timesales(contract, start_date):
        data = ib.reqHistoricalTicks(contract, start_date, """", 1000, 'Trades', 1, True)
        if bool(data) == True:
            data = pd.DataFrame(data)
            data['time'] = data['time'].dt.tz_convert('US/Pacific')
            data['time'] = data.time.astype(str)
            data['time'] = data.time.str[:19]

            data['strike'] = contract.strike
            data['flag'] = contract.right
            data['exp_date'] = contract.lastTradeDateOrContractMonth
            last = data['time'].iloc[-1]
            master.append(data)
            print(contract)
            if len(data.index) > 999:
                fetch_timesales(contract, last)
    
    for date in trading_days:
        for contract in contracts:
            fetch_timesales(contract, date)
    
    
    df = pd.concat(master, axis=0)
    print(df)

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list.

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK ETFs, or even BB, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic.

**Results and some stats:**

Right now I'm up 75% YTD, compared to the SP500's 15% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously of course, and I don't claim that this is a great strategy, just one that has been lucky due to 2021's craziness)

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 35% (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- **Max drawdown of -8.7%** (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, Reddit sentiment weathered COVID pretty well)

2021-06-10,"""Scalping""?","""Scalping""? I was holding off posting specifics here. But I realize now my algorithm is nothing profound so I might as well ask a few questions. I stole inspiration from scalping strategies. Less from the bid ask discrepancy and more so the small profits over volume. Anyway I basically scan for stocks moving sideways. I find the most active stocks and make limit buy orders under a certain quantity. Then sell whatever orders are filled.

Positioning matters quite a bit. In short I can buy/sell apple stock but the price is completely unpredictable. While less active stocks are easier to predict but hard to sell off. I find small success taking a mean regressive approach. Which functionally means buying something that's oversold in the short run. But I'm wondering if trend following would be better.

2021-05-11,My hard way to learn EMA's formula and deep dive of EMA,"My hard way to learn EMA's formula and deep dive of EMA 1. My lesson started from contrasting my calculated EMA values with platform such as TradingView and Webull
2. I was surprised that even large platform gives me ***different value*** of EMA for the same symbol and same window size.
3. For example, symbol **COIN** has EMA10/MA10 = **274.08**/286.53 from Webull, but TradingView gave me **283.77**/286.53. (on 05-07-2021)
4. The EMA10 of COIN between two platform is having delta **-9.69** = 274.08 - 283.77 (**3%** of diff.)
5. Then the question here is which one is correct? and why they are different?
6. (Spoiler) TradingView is correct.
7. (If I jump to the conclusion) Fortunately, the delta **only happens** in the scenario that the symbol does not have long enough of price history and **will not happen** if price history is long enough.

[EMA formula from Wiki](https://preview.redd.it/lkcro5megky61.png?width=286&format=png&auto=webp&s=005b6f674016de3a13344dd5a322befefe962353)

1. The root cause comes from the EMA formula itself. The very first value (S1) of EMA is very critical, since all subsequent EMA values will dependent the first EMA value. (e.g. S2 = Y2\*1/3 + S1\*2/3, when alpha = 1/3)
2. Let’s call the first value of EMA as **initial value**. The interesting part is there is no a strict way to define what is the initial value. However, the common way in trading is **using the SMA value as the initial value of EMA**. Reference \[2\].
3. Fun fact, If you look into tradingView screen shot, then you would notice the first value of SMA10 and EMA10 are the same.
4. Then how do we calculate correct EMA value? In theory, we should calculate the very first value of the price history and all the way to latest. But, isn’t it inefficient? Then AAPL has so long history, should I calculate from 1980?
5. The answer is it depends on the window size. As long as we prepare long enough of price history versus the window size, then the EMA value will becomes the same. In an other word, as long as the the overall price history is **X** times larger then the window size, then **the effect of initial value will drop**.
6. I did a small experience using Python, in the case of EMA10, as long as your total price history is larger than 4 times (**X**=4, window=10, price history=40), then the EMA10 value will be the same to the **second decimal.**
7. **Key takeaway**: Be careful when the symbol is just IPO, the EMA value could be different depend on which library you used to calculate. Also **MACD** value might be variant a lot since it is based on EMA12 and EMA26.

I am currently building and operating a neural network based algo; more building than operating because every time I operate I just go back to building more.  However it has been profitable since launch.  The model is built off of a combination of: CNN for 11 day swing trade signal, LSTM for end of day price prediction, and NLP news sentiment data.  The CNN and LSTM are proprietary built and operated, the news sentiment is a vendor product.  We currently are limiting our operation (due to time constraints) to the Information Technology Sector of the S&P500 with plans to expand our NN training to all the sectors for signal diversification.

My primary business is consumer finance, however I've diverted some HR assets almost exclusively to this project.  I have a high level coder in my CFO, a data scientist with a Phd in Physics (the primary operator/analyst), a mathematician (part-time assistance), and a CPA as well as myself (general business and investing acumen) dedicated to making this successful.  Disclaimer: we are all relatively capable and have learned an enormous amount since embarking on this project however none of us have any real experience in finance or trading, someone with a solid history in trading and finance would be a plus but not necessarily a deal breaker. 

One of our business entities is facing a likely liquidation event this year and my hope is to partner with another person or group that is in a similar boat that might want to take a cooperative approach to making the most successful algo we can build.  My intent is to operate the algo as a ""family office"" of sorts or a prop firm as they call it, however really just trading our own capital.  The goal is to achieve great annual returns without the need to operate with as many employee variables as my legacy business models have had; something I can pass down to my children that they won't necessarily screw up :).  

If you've read this far I hope I didn't bore anyone; if you have a real product or experience you think would be valuable to team up on and be a value add for both sides we are all hands on deck to make this work regardless but in the name of speed would really like to work cooperatively to cover the bases of all the things might be missing.",0.0,Neutral,English

Wondering if anyone else has run into this issue. I've been trying to use the yahoo finance API for historical data for a simple algo I'm working on for SPX options. Normally, I have no problems using it for normal stocks, but SPX is acting weird. Check out these two results comparing AAPL with SPX, where I just want daily prices for the last 5 days:

[https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/aapl?range=5d&interval=1d](https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/aapl?range=5d&interval=1d)

The only thing that has changed is that the 2nd query only returns one day's worth of prices. I have tried out several other stocks, and this problem seems to only exist for SPX. I got curious to see if I could at least look at the prices on the Yahoo website, however for SPX no rows show up at all:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESPX/history?period1=1616025600&period2=1616457600&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESPX/history?period1=1616025600&period2=1616457600&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true)

Note that if you go to the ""chart"" link on that webpage, a plot will show up, so I know that the SPX data exists...

Has anyone else seen this problem? Is there another (preferably free) source for SPX prices that I could easily use? The Yahoo finance API is working fine for the current price, and for the options chain, so it's really only the historical prices that are not working for me. I've been wracking my brain on this for a few days.

Polygon gives you several trades per second per ticker, and it wouldn't have to be at that good of an interval but it does need to be on the order of seconds and not minutes.

2021-03-08,Identifying which stocks that are the subject of a forum post,"Identifying which stocks that are the subject of a forum post I am working on a hobby project that involves performing analysis on posts found on both Reddit and a few other websites, however I am struggling with automating the detection of which company is being referred to in which post.

I have a massive list of trading symbols and company names that I am pulling from FinnHub automatically once a week - including all tickers trading on US and Canadian exchanges. For now, I'm just focusing on tickers. The issue I am running into is that there are stock tickers like ""A"", ""B"", etc. which make distinguishing them from other text difficult. Also, since random users are posting, one user might write Apple as ""APPL"", whereas another might write ""$APPL"", or even ""NASDAQ: AAPL"". This lack of standard formatting is challenging.

I have been playing around with the NLP product ""SpaCy"" for python, and I'm able to break post titles down into their various tokens/parts. I was thinking I could combine a Regex pattern matching strategy with NLP to identify *how* the matches are being used in the context of the post title. I'm hoping this will ultimately lead to a solution that can identify companies correctly 85-90% of the time.

Any suggestions? Has anyone done anything similar to this? Once I've identified the subject of each post, there is additional analysis I plan on doing centered around sentiment, the posters history of posts, and various other factors.

2021-02-22,Newsletter algorithm for aging mother?,"Newsletter algorithm for aging mother? Hello r/algotrading,

I've got a perhaps strange question. My mother has been investing for almost a decade, and has gotten significantly more interested in it since her retirement last year. It's going great, and I want to support her in doing so; I think it's a wonderful way for her to keep her brain active, and she's making money that can go right to her retirement. However, she follows a number of newsletters that publish buy/sell recommendations. While the newsletters themselves seem quite good and she's making money off of their recommendations, she's mentioned several times how she feels like she has to always be on her phone or near her computer; once the recommendations come out, they often run up to the buy up to price or more within ten minutes. This is very stressful for her, and cuts into the joy she's having in retirement- she'll be out on a walk with my father, and will come back and find she missed an opportunity. This disincentivizes her from doing anything, and I'd like to help!

&#x200B;

It seems to me that the ideal solution would be to pay someone to make a trading algorithm that monitors her Gmail account for emails coming in with specific strings in the title or from specific senders; one that then quickly reads the email and buys (/sells) the stock if the price is still below the buy-up-to price (/sale price). She trades on TD Ameritrade, and there have been numerous threads on this subreddit regarding using their API to buy/sell.

&#x200B;

Obviously this is a large security risk; the programmer would have access to her brokerage and to her email. Does r/algotrading have any recommendations on how to keep the security risk low? I'm familiar with Upwork and Fiverr for hiring programmers for a specific task; are there websites better suited for this? Lastly, while I'm certainly willing to spend the money to make sure it's done right; does anyone have an estimate for the number of hours something like this would take, and what a reasonable cost would be?

2021-02-21,[Resource] Marana: Tools for Data Analysis and Algo-Trading in C#,"[Resource] Marana: Tools for Data Analysis and Algo-Trading in C# Note to Mods: I hope this doesn't break rule #1. I don't intend to promote this project for any gain. I am aiming to share my free and open-source work and tools with the algo-trading community in this post.

## Intro

So I've been frequenting this sub for a while and wanted to share a project that I've developed named [Marana](https://github.com/tanjera/marana) (and its source code, and all the resources used to develop it!). Marana is a free and open-source cross-platform project written in C# (.NET 5) using MySQL that does a lot of heavy lifting for downloading data (without scraping!), technical analysis, data organization (database management of data, allows for user querying), and automation of running queries to trigger buy/sell actions (algo-trading!). It is still in alpha phase and undergoing rapid development (use at your own risk!), but I feel like the source code- and the projects Marana depends on- could be a great resource for others out there developing algo-trading routines in C# (because wtf are numpys and pandas??).

## Brief Write-Up

Marana is released open-source under the Apache License. Marana does the following tasks:

* Terminal GUI for entry of settings (API keys, database connection info)
* Terminal GUI or command-line download of daily historical data
   * Per options, uses Alpaca or Alpha Vantage
   * Per options, can download a watchlist or all available data
   * Per options, can download 300 - 1000 days of data per symbol
* Runs technical analysis indicators on the stocks
   * SMA's, EMA's, MACD, RSI, ROC, BBs, etc.
* Maintains all data in a MySQL database
   * Yes, I know a MySQL database is overkill, but it gives the user a lot of flexibility
   * Data can be queried in any MySQL database viewer
      * Can run SQL queries to use the data for stock screening and analysis
* Reads custom Strategies and Instructions from database for automated trading (live and paper)
   * User must enter SQL queries (strategies) that trigger buy/sell signals
   * User must enter instructions for trading (e.g. strategy, symbol, # shares)
      * Can execute automation instructions via Alpaca API

Since Marana runs some commands via the command-line interface (CLI), it can be automated by the operating system to run on a set schedule (e.g. to update the library and execute automated trade instructions daily).

Many users have given the WebSockets service a good review, while others have reported issues. On the whole, I think Polygon has the potential to be a really great provider if they're able to fix the issues that myself and others have reported.*

I created a [polygon.io](https://polygon.io) account recently to test out their RESTful API, and I'm shocked at how bad the data is, especially considering how much they charge ($199/month for Developer access) and the hype I've heard. I'm just sharing this for others who might be considering Polygon.

It seems Polygon's CEO, Quinton Pike /u/qrpike, is active on this board, so maybe he can respond. Below are just a few of the problems I encountered within the first 5 minutes of testing the API:

**Ticker Details endpoint** [**(documentation)**](https://polygon.io/docs/get_v1_meta_symbols__stocksTicker__company_anchor)

When I try to query ticker BF.B (Brown-Forman Corp Class B), I get a 404 error response:

    https://api.polygon.io/v1/meta/symbols/BF.B/company?&apiKey=XXXXXXXXXXXX
    
    {
      ""error"":""Not Found""
    }

I've tried the following symbol variants: BF.B, BF-B, BFB, and BF%2EB, and none of them work. I thought maybe it's just a bug with tickers that include a special character, but when I try querying ticker BRK.B (Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B), I get a successful response:

    https://api.polygon.io/v1/meta/symbols/BRK.B/company?&apiKey=XXXXXXXXXXXX

    }

**Tickers endpoint (**[**documentation**](https://polygon.io/docs/get_v2_reference_tickers_anchor)**)**

When I query the Tickers endpoint, I can see the Brown-Forman stock listed with ticker ""BF.B"" below. Furthermore, the quote page in Polygon's Stocks UI uses the BF.B ticker too: [https://polygon.io/quote/BF.B](https://polygon.io/quote/BF.B).

But also get this: notice that ""url"" property included in the response for each stock? None of those URLs work. *None of them.* I get a 404 error page at all those links.

**Out of date ticker: AAXN vs. AXON**

On January 26, 2021 (almost one month ago), Axon Enterprise Inc. changed their ticker symbol from AAXN to AXON. Polygon hasn't updated this. The ticker details endpoint for AXON brings up the incorrect stock:

    https://api.polygon.io/v1/meta/symbols/AXON/company?&apiKey=XXXXXXXXXXX
    
    {
      ""logo"":""https://s3.polygon.io/logos/axon/logo.png"",

      ""exchange"":""Nasdaq Global Select"",
      ""name"":""Axovant Sciences Ltd."",
      ""symbol"":""AXON"",
      ""active"":true
    }

Querying the old symbol (AAXN) brings up the correct stock:

    https://api.polygon.io/v1/meta/symbols/AAXN/company?&apiKey=XXXXXXXXXXX
    
    {
      ""logo"":""https://s3.polygon.io/logos/aaxn/logo.png"",

      ""exchange"":""Nasdaq Global Select"",
      ""name"":""Axon Enterprise Inc."",
      ""symbol"":""AAXN"",
      ""active"":true
    }

But when querying any of the stock quote endpoints, you have to use the new symbol (AXON) to get the correct price for Axon Enterprise Inc.:

    https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/AXON/2021-02-19?unadjusted=true&apiKey=

      ""status"": ""OK"",

2021-02-20,Is Polygon Selling Data Illegally?,"Is Polygon Selling Data Illegally? TL;DR, Alpaca's abrupt termination of free Polygon data feeds might be an indication that the latter could have been caught for potentially illegal distribution of market data.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: I do not work for any of the companies mentioned in the post. All my conclusions are based on publicly available information.

&#x200B;

When I first found out about the free Polygon data offered by Alpaca, I had my doubts. So I actually spent some time doing research. Now that Alpaca just announced that they will no longer provide free access to Polygon's data feed. I think it's time for me to share some of my findings.

&#x200B;

1. Where did the market data come from?

First let's take a look at the US stocks trading volume by venue: [https://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/market\_share/](https://markets.cboe.com/us/equities/market_share/)

We can see that the most of the exchanges are owned by the Big 3: NYSE, Nasdaq, CBOE (BATS & EDGE). On top of that, Investors Exchange (IEX) offers market data for free, along with some more recently and smaller exchanges.

In order to access the market data, one could either directly subscribe to each exchange's proprietary data, or from the SIPs (Securities Information Processor), which consolidate the market data from different exchanges.

Currently, there are 2 major SIPs for US equities:

[CTA](https://www.ctaplan.com/index): Administered by NYSE, which covers Tape A and Tape B stocks.

[UTP](https://www.utpplan.com/overview): Administered by Nasdaq, which basically consolidates all Nasdaq listed stocks' data.

&#x200B;

2. What are the market data distribution policy?

Here is sample data redistribution fees schedule from [CBOE](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/membership/US_Market_Data_Product_Price_List.pdf).

We can see that the subscriber needs to declare:

* Internal distribution vs External distribution
* Display usage vs non-display usage
* For each data recipient: Pro vs Non-pro

&#x200B;

3. How much would it cost to distribute data like Polygon's?

Since Polygon appears to be distributing SIPs data, we can find the CTA & UTP fee schedule in the reference. But for simplicity I made a simple table:

&#x200B;

[The recurring fees are $10,500\/mo + per user fees](https://preview.redd.it/l9cl7kxgyni61.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=2def25c8701d3d425d0fc81ddfc0116ec3ccef5a)

Note that the table above shows several per user fees. Let's assume that y'all being honest and declare as ""non-professional"" users that only use the data for ""display"" usage. This alone would incur a $3/mo/subscriber fee.

&#x200B;

4. Why Polygon might be violating the data redistribution agreement?

&#x200B;

A. There is no way Alpaca can legally offer the ""free"" Polygon feeds.

Why? It's simple. Every distributor of the market data must **directly** sign the agreements with the exchanges, which also means the same fees, see table above, would apply to Alpaca.

Now, tell me, how is it possible to deposit as little as $1 with Alpaca to get the full feed, without Alpaca bleeding money like the California High-Speed Rail Project? Considering that Alpaca is responsible for all the above fees, including at least $3/mo/subscriber?

&#x200B;

B. The ""non-display"" charge

According to CTA's [policy](https://www.ctaplan.com/publicdocs/ctaplan/notifications/trader-update/Policy%20-%20CTA%20Non%20Display%20with%20FAQ.pdf), Examples of Non-Display Use are, but are not limited to:

* Any trading in any asset class
* Automated order or quote generation and/or order pegging
* Price referencing for algorithmic trading
* ......

By definition, every Alpaca's client is an algo trader, so the usage should be treated as non-display. Now let's go back to the previous table. The total non-display should be $9,500/mo **per subscriber**.

Well, but I don't recall paying $9,500/mo. My guess is that Polygon basically ""sub-licensed"" the data to Alpaca, without the exchanges ever knowing, so that no one has to pay the monstrous fees.

&#x200B;

C. The WebSocket data?

So the Alpaca-Polygon deal seems shady, is Polygon's own data legit enough?

After inspecting the CTA [policies](https://www.ctaplan.com/policy), it appears that by steaming the market data, the recipient would need to pay indirect access fee as well, which is $3k/mo for CTA and $500/mo for UTP.

Again, from Polygon's offering, I failed to see how the business can be sustainable and legitimate at the same time.

&#x200B;

Conclusion

I am not a lawyer and I have no access to Polygon's agreement with the exchanges or Alpaca. I am only making educated guess based on the publicly available information. There are so many popular API data services that were later found to be distributing data illegally, which ultimately hurts algo traders like you and me.

BTW, I am not defending the exchanges. I think their pricing is BS and I hate them for essentially monopolizing the market data business. [https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/lndax9/nasdaq\_nyse\_sue\_sec\_to\_block\_market\_data\_overhaul/](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/lndax9/nasdaq_nyse_sue_sec_to_block_market_data_overhaul/)

But I do want to have a legit data service which I don't have to fear being terminated with only 6 days of notice.

2021-02-19,Replacement for Polygon.io Data feed,"Replacement for Polygon.io Data feed Just got the following email from Alpaca.

""We've been working hard to improve your Alpaca experience and are excited to announce our Alpaca Data API version 2!

Data is the backbone of API access to the market, and we have established our very own data product that can evolve alongside with the Alpaca platform. We are starting minimally with real-time and historical price data and will be adding various types of the data suited for the Alpaca users.

The upcoming switch to version 2 means that all Polygon.io services through Alpaca will soon be discontinued. Please read below to understand what you need to do to minimize the impact during this process.

Alpaca Data API v2

We are introducing two market data plans for our customers. 
Basic. This plan is included in both paper-only and live trading accounts as the default plan for free. It is best suited for those who only use data less actively and don’t require data from all US stock exchanges.
Pro. $49 per month*. Best for people who want to have unlimited access to data with a 100% market coverage (SIP data feed) for US stocks. (Selected eligible users will receive free credits)

You can see more details about our new pricing here:

* Selected eligible users will receive free credits.

What's changing

As of Feb 26, 2021 after market hours, you will no longer be able to use your current Polygon.io data feed via your Alpaca API key. However, Polygon.io will provide a 100% discount coupon for March to our users who are using Polygon.io data. You need to take action immediately to ensure you retain your access and will need to create an account on Polygon.io’ website.

Please use coupon code ALPACA during checkout on Polygon.io to claim your free month.

After your free month, you will be charged the regular price for Polygon.io. For the pricing details, please visit https://polygon.io/pricing. 

We aim to make the transition as smooth as possible, therefore we will be sharing more information with you about the new features in the upcoming week along with tutorials and documentation.

Thanks for all your support and feedback over the past year since the launch of the Data API! We’re excited to be entering this next phase of an even more awesome data product.


Onwards & Upwards,
Alpaca Team""

I made a rudimentary trading bot using the Python [Robinstocks API](https://robin-stocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html). This script buys stocks on an inputted watch list while selling your holdings based on a certain criterion. This criterion can easily be changed in the code.

2021-02-14,Which API would you suggest for pulling news?,"Which API would you suggest for pulling news? I started a new long-term project in developing a stocks bot that I envision will eventually be a full-fledged algo-trading bot. I'm currently trying to find an API that will provide News articles and potentially links to those articles on a specific ticker. 

I've already tried using NewsApi.orgs news api because of the free and rather generous development subscription plan. However, I've realized that news provided on the stock market (let alone specific tickers) is very limited. I've been eyeing polgyon.io and stocknewsapi because both explicitly state they offer the exact services im looking for. However, I'm leaning more towards polygon because they currently have a free development subscription while stocknewsapi only offers a 14 day free trial. 

Have any of you guys used either of these APIs before? which one would you suggest? I'm also open to other API recommendations. 

Thank you!",0.0,Neutral,English

I am happy to announce that I finally finished cleaning, organizing, creating baselines, and developing an automated collection pipeline that collects minute-by-minute market data for Cryptocurrencies. It updates on Kaggle every day! And will keep doing so until the competition is over! \[Maybe even more\]

The whole project took me a lot of time to develop and is not easy to maintain, so please if you find this of value: Your feedback & support is highly appreciated!

## The Competition

As some of you know, there is Crypto forecasting competition is running on Kaggle: ""G-Research Crypto Forecasting"". In this competition, we need to use machine learning for forecasting short-term returns of popular cryptocurrencies \[such as bitcoin, ether, dogecoin..\] We are provided a dataset of millions of rows of high-frequency market data dating back to 2018 which we should use to build our models on. Once the submission deadline has passed, the final score will be calculated over the following 3 months using live crypto data as it is collected.

## Auto-updating Kaggle dataset

To make things more interesting: I created an Auto-Updating Kaggle dataset that collects high-frequency market data for multiple cryptocurrencies.

* Updates daily on Kaggle!
* Available for anyone to play with!

Also, I also released **20+ starter notebooks** each demonstrating a different model or method for forecasting future returns.

This project was meant to be for the currently running Crypto Forecasting Competition by G-Research. However, since it is publicly available I assumed many others would like to also have a look :)

**Mimics ""Real-Life"" better than typical datasets**

This is a unique opportunity to work in a much more ""real-life"" setup than usual Kaggle. Because the datasets update daily.

* so.. If you mess up and overfit..
* You see it tomorrow! 😂

Anyway, this is an ongoing project that is also beginner-friendly since it is highly documented. Many more Time Series / Finance-related notebooks will be released in the future so this can also serve as a ""first stop"" when studying Time Series analysis.

## Auto updating - Full Price Datasets

I created an up-to-today \[auto updating\] dataset which contains the full historical data for all assets of the competition so you can easily build models that utilize it. The datasets are split to each asset since they are much heavier than the competition data. The datasets have also been labeled as described in the competition overview and had been organized in a way that they are at the exact format of the competition data.

**The goal of this is to provide a dataset that:**

1. Contains the FULL history for each asset. Currently, the competition data goes back to 2018. This dataset contains data from even earlier.
2. Auto updating daily - Due to the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, we should train our models on the most recent data available. These datasets have a backend pipeline for collecting, formatting, and reuploading to kaggle. They are scheduled to be updated daily, every single day until the end of the competition.
3. Preprocessed - The datasets had been ffilled to overcome any missing values issue that is present in the original competition dataset.

**The Datasets:**

* [Binance Coin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-binance-coin)
* [Bitcoin Cash](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-bitcoin-cash)
* [Bitcoin](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-bitcoin)

* [TRON](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/cryptocurrency-extra-data-tron)

>**Bonus dataset:** I've also uploaded a dataset containing the most powerful source for predicting cryptocurrencies movement: Elon Musk's Twitter 😂! It is simply an updated dataset of all Elon Musk's tweets 😂. I must check if Elon Musk can help us win! 👌 You can play with it yourself [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/elon-musks-twitter-updated-031121).



**Technical details about the Data** For every asset in the competition, the following fields from [Binance's official API endpoint for historical candlestick data](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md#klinecandlestick-data) are collected, saved, and processed.

1. timestamp - A timestamp for the minute covered by the row.
2. Asset\_ID - An ID code for the cryptoasset.
3. Count - The number of trades that took place this minute.
4. Open - The USD price at the beginning of the minute.
5. High - The highest USD price during the minute.
6. Low - The lowest USD price during the minute.
7. Close - The USD price at the end of the minute.
8. Volume - The number of cryptoasset u units traded during the minute.
9. VWAP - The volume-weighted average price for the minute. 10.Target - 15 minute residualized returns. See the 'Prediction and Evaluation section of this notebook for details of how the target is calculated.
10. Weight - Weight, defined by the competition hosts [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cstein06/tutorial-to-the-g-research-crypto-competition)
11. Asset\_Name - Human readable Asset name.

**Indexing** The dataframe is indexed by `timestamp` and sorted from oldest to newest. The first row starts at the first timestamp available on the exchange, which is July 2017 for the longest-running pairs.

2021-05-31,Speeding Up the Fitting of SVI Volatility Surface Python,"Speeding Up the Fitting of SVI Volatility Surface Python Hi, 

I have developed an arb-free volatility surface using python, I have tried both differential\_evolution and least\_squares from the scipy optimization package to fit the curves, as well as vectorized all the functions. I can fit something like an AAPL surface 150 days out in \~2 minutes however SPX takes much longer due to the weekly expiries and large amount of strikes, I am trying to compute historical surfaces and it is almost unbearable. Does anyone know a better algorithm to fit the surface? is it worth learning C++? I am an undergrad student in Economics so programming isn't my strongest asset.",0.0,Neutral,English

2021-02-02,Anyone Working on Cryptocurrency-Related Quant Projects?,"Anyone Working on Cryptocurrency-Related Quant Projects? I think there is a huge untapped potential in the cryptocurrency market for creating scalable quant trading strategies. 

I've been researching some of the existing ones but they're either focused on shitcoins, trade only one currency, or cannot accommodate large trade sizes. The only one so far that looks somewhat compelling is Greypool, they have a whitepaper clearly and empirically detailing their fundamental strategy and they are looking for experienced quants to work with.

Has anyone here had any experience with them? I'm considering trying their automated strategies at least.
