This is a simulation on AAPL. It's a PUT debit spread that's paid by 2 naked PUTs. What are the downsides?   


Stock goes up or stays the same: keep the initial credit and let it expire

Stock goes down in the trap (as the guy calls it): more money

Stock goes down a lot: 2 x assignment or roll.

2023-11-07,Book recommendations,"Book recommendations Hey there. I'm starting to learn a bit. My goal is to try and make relatively small trades with a high likelihood of profitability and limited risk/reward with the understanding that obviously I'll lose some capital also. Ideally over time I can on average bring in a bit of extra income. Not looking to get rich quick or quit my job.

I'm looking to learn from a respectable source some strategies to look into, to start small. Unfortunately the internet is a cesspool of misinformation. I just saw a guy recommending people naked short puts of apple stock with like $100k referring to the premium as ""a dividend"". Even as absolute novice this seems like a good way to be in debt a massive amount of money very quickly, if your broker even allowed you to take up such a risky position. It kinda filled me with rage, that this was being passed off as advice to ""live off dividends with very little investment capital"".

Anyway. I would appreciate any recommendations for some level-headed reality based information that's geared toward entry level. I've looked through the wiki, and am working my way through some links. I am just curious if anyone has a favourite resource that maybe isn't listed. Thanks.

2023-11-06,thinkorswim - Stop Wasting Money & Don't Fall for the Price Defaults,"thinkorswim - Stop Wasting Money & Don't Fall for the Price Defaults I was just adjusting a trade and realized something I've been doing but others may not know about. In the thinkorswim platform, there are a few ways you can adjust the price for an order. However, two are super misleading. Let's look at an example in SSO:

https://preview.redd.it/c1bl7mq1iryb1.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=80512aae504a1d45794af88b9350d02cf5b20740

When you have an order prepped to send, you'll see this (the computer platform, the phone UI is slightly different but same exact concept.

1. You can adjust your price by clicking the +/- buttons & it will move the price for you by a set increment: DO NOT USE THIS *if you see the increment move more than 0.01.*

* For this trade in SSO, if you use the +/- here, it automatically moves the price by 0.05. So right now the natural is 0.45 and the mid is 0.50.
* When you click the +/- buttons, price would go from 0.45 straight to 0.50 - leading you to believe those are the only prices it would accept - this isn't true.

1. You can slide the price on the Nat - Mid range provided, but you'll notice it moves in the same default increments as the +/- buttons above.
2. Finally, the correct choice. If I try the +/- quickly and see it move in anything other than 0.01 increments, I will then click into the price box indicated by #2 above and manually input the price I want. For this trade, I was closing cash secured puts and ended up getting a fill at 0.42 simply by putting in the price (the trade above is to sell just for the sake of an example after the fact).

This might seem a bit petty but it's such a silly reason to lose a few cents on each trade. In this case, on a 15 lot, that's 0.03 or $3 per lot or $45. The cost adds up over time.

Hope this helps in case you didn't know.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-10-31,Next steps - playing Mega-techs / Spy,"Next steps - playing Mega-techs / Spy I played NVDA when it hit it's high, made about 30,000 on puts, and turned that around and played spy down through mega-tech earnings. Ended up with just under 100,000. Lost some in the last couple of days... I knew that spy was going to rebound over the 200 MA and still screwed up. I'm using trading view along with lux algo and, although helpful, I don't feel like I know enough about either (just started using them) to really make the best use of them... I have 4 years of solid experience, trading almost daily, I've had great ups and stupid downs, and now I've been trying to be much more precise and make constant gains. Up through the reversal back up over the last 2 days I had had 3 straight weeks of gains (200 - 210%), but I'm not sure where to go from here. My TA says Spy should drop but interest rates may drop, don't know where we are going in the short-term for a number of reasons, and I try not to play expensive premium options, when possible. I trade on extrinsic value (when I'm ITM). Outside of Apple's earnings, which I personally think will be bearish, I'm feeling a bit burnt out and like I need to tap a new vein of the market. I know this is a broud post with no real direction, but I would love some feedback on some ideas of how to continue my upward momentum. I don't want to get hyperfixate (as I usually do, super ADD) and play Spy as it trades sideways / up, in the short-term. I could just sit on my hands...
Im long (20 years) on 40,000 shares of Goog A/C (26k / 14k)  that I could write covered calls / puts on, but, honestly, haven't done that before, and, there are some other financial considerations I'd have to think about. I know there are other assets/commodities/etc to play out there, but I would love to hear any feedback on which areas of the market to turn to next / opinions on TV/LA learning curve, usage, and all the other things I mentioned in my little post.

Throughout the entire sell-off things have been fairly orderly overall. And that is reflected in the fact that the VIX hasn't really gotten above 22, even recently. The 20 area in the VIX had been where the market had seen buyers step in over the past 9 months or so but not this time. Whether that gets resolved with a VIX spike closer to 30 soon or not remains to be seen but traders should be watching that for any sort or capitulation indication of at least this recent selling causing a little panic selling of stocks. 0DTE and weekly IV is certainly higher now with daily expected moves now regularly over 1%.

I'm seeking your input on some option strategies and which one would be the best use of my money. I currently have $250,000 in cash and am looking to generate a consistent return of over 10%. So far, I've been selling CSP on SPY and have had good results. I would greatly appreciate your advice on the following strategies. Thank you in advance for your input.

2023-10-11,Monte Carlo methods for optimizing covered call strategy,"Monte Carlo methods for optimizing covered call strategy Hey everyone. A little background on me, I do software with some math at my day job, and passively invest. I am an extremely conservative investor, I just buy some VOO every week. 

But occasionally I like to do some ""risky"" trades, in 2021 I wrote a little program to help me backtest blue chip stocks against their historical DCF valuations using old 10-K data, just for fun. Then in 2022 I used it to help pick some blue chip tech stocks. I figured while the tech sector was being beaten down, I would try to see if there were any bargains and I ended up picking up some Google and Apple for a decent discount of like \~30%

Now, obviously I don't expect that to happen again. That was just me experimenting and getting very lucky. But I'd like to be slightly more active now by writing covered calls on SPY. The problem is, I can't find any good sources on using math for optimizing call strategies, specifically for covered calls.

There are lots of good layperson-readable sources for valuation (Aswath Damodaran) and Modern Portfolio Theory, but I can't find anything like that for options. 

I am really looking for something that can be plugged into a Monte Carlo simulation and show me a graph that I can use to figure out the strike price and expiration date that fits within my risk tolerance. 

Basically I'd like to say ""hey I'd like to make 2-3% more per year on top of my buy-and-hold strategy, but only have a 5-10% risk of actually having to sell in a given year"", then consult with the output of some algorithm to see if that's reasonable.",0.0,Neutral,English

**Strategy**

Selling cash secured leap puts as a conservative investment strategy to gain exposure into dividend stocks and still benefit from current high interest rates in money market funds that may fluctuate higher.

**Overview**

The idea for the following strategy is to gain exposure to dividend stock in the event they decline from different sectors, while retaining the benefit of the high interest rates currently in core cash positions that are comparable to dividend payouts. When selling cash secured leap puts, certain brokers let you continue to earn interest on the cash reserved in the money market. This means you will earn interest on cash reserved for the strike and interest from the premium you collected selling the contract.

**Goals**

To determine if selling the following option contracts are worth the downside exposure and upside opportunity cost. This strategy is conservative so we will assume the alternative investment is a money market account earing 4.75% interest.

Using TFC, if we were to sell a cash secured put we would collect $420 and continue to earn interest on the $2,920 ($2500 Strike + $420 Premium) at 4.75% APY, making the best case return $738 ($420 Premium +  $318 interest) for the duration of 838 days. This is a 12.87% yearly return **as long as the option is not exercised early, ends above the $25 Strike, and interests averages 4.75% for the period**. To determine if downside exposure is worth the risk I must first decide what I think the lowest price the stock will end up by end of the option contract. I am thinking $15 so the worst I think I can reasonable lose is $262. This is because the Premium and interest I collected would lower my cost basis from the $25 to $17.62 by the end of the contract. Please note this is not the most I can lose in this transaction because if the stock immediately went to 0 I would lose $2080 (Strike - premium). However, I don't think it is reasonable to assume it will go to 0 by the end of the contract and more likely end around $15. Using the $25 strike delta this would imply we have a 33.15% to lose $262 and a 66.85% to gain the $738. Taking risk into consideration our model returns $407 (.3315\*-$262) + (.6687\*$738), which is higher than our expected alternative benchmark of $272 so the risk is worth it. The potential upside loss is done similarly. I think the highest the stock can potentially end up by the end of the period is $35 and the delta of our breakeven is 58.66%. My breakeven on the upside is $35.99 (Current price + Premium + interest). Since the breakeven is above what I think the stock could reasonable end at for the duration of the contract I don't believe there is a chance of missing out on potential profit had I owned the stock. Now that I have this theory we want to also visualize if I was wrong for both the Downside and Upside.

**Example**

This chart models out the downside exposure in the event I was wrong about the most likely worst case scenario on the downside component. In the TFC example I estimated the reasonable worst case scenario the stock could end up at is $15, which is a decrease in 40% below the strike price I am willing to buy the stock. If the stock was to decrease 50% below my strike and end at $12.50 I would lose $512.

If the stock was to continue to increase and end 50% above the current price, my opportunity cost would be $692 that I missed out from not buying the stock.

2023-09-24,"Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Apple, Costco, Nike, Micron and more.","Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Apple, Costco, Nike, Micron and more. Last week saw a pop in volatility and several down days following the FOMC announcement. SPY finished the week down 2.9%, nearly 3x the move options were pricing. The VIX closed on Thursday Sept 14th below 13, into a Sept 15th triple witching expiry that saw the expiration of alot of gamma that may have been keeping a lid on market volatility while some bad news piled up. Once that gamma got unwound/expired implied vol began ticking up into the FOMC meeting and then even higher with stocks going lower out of the meeting. 

The VIX is now above 17, still slightly below its historical mean but now matching its highest levels since late May. In other words, the low vol, slow grind higher we saw over the entire summer looks to have come to an end, at least for now, with September expiration. Keep an eye on both weekly IV as well as 30-60 day IV as both got very low into that Sept 15th expiry. Stocks that had seen a slow grind higher all Summer were suddenly making large moves in the span of days or weeks that options weren't pricing to happen in the span of multiple months in the future. 

For traders, it's helpful to look at recent stock moves and compare to the expected move in the future to see instinctually if options are inexpensive out in the future. Just as an example, NVDA has made several 15% moves in the past month, yet options are not pricing that sort of move to happen again until December expiry:

And Apple has made several moves in the 8-10% range recently, yet options aren't pricing a 10% move until well into the beginning of 2024:

There's no guarantee the volatility will continue, it could stop on a dime again. But, options clearly are still in a hangover from the low vol days of Summer and are still playing catch-up. The weeklies have made the biggest spike so far, now pricing in expected moves about 50% higher than just a few weeks ago. Here's this week's look:

Options are pricing about a 4.5% move. That's higher than the past 4 actual earnings moves in the stock which were 0%, -3%, -1% and -1%. One would have to assume that the reason for expectations of a larger move than recent ones center around any AI updates in the numbers and on the call.

UiPath in a very similar situation, slightly higher but off its post-earnings highs outside market hours and now well inside what options were pricing. On the flipside C3.ai Inc (AI)is down about 14%, slightly more than the 12.5% move options were pricing. The big story since late yesterday is AAPL's quick plunge following reports that the Chinese government is extending the prohibition of Apple’s iPhones. Apple is down more than 7% since yesterday afternoon.

To put that move in perspective, Apple options were not pricing a 7%+ move until late November. In fact, the recent chart in Apple looks a bit detached from current low IV in the options in general, with the stock having just made 7%+ moves several times since late July:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2s3cuvpb7umb1.gif

Apple vol is low historically, with 30-day IV about 23, while the past year's realized vol has been 29. The assumption often with a mega-cap stock like AAPL is that while bouts of volatility happen, the stock will reset to a grind higher at some point with low realized and implied vol. But AAPL has been moving for the past month and change in ways that options continue to underprice.

Docusign is the big earnings after the bell. Options are pricing about a 9% move at the moment. Prior earnings have seen moves of -3, -23% +12% and +11%.

Recently, I started another strategy on a few stocks like AMZN, TGT, TSLA, & AAPL, where I bought 100 shares and sold ITM call (Buy write strategy). The small amount is only used for a buy-write strategy, it seems to be generating an income > CSP on SPY. Wondering if there are any well-back-tested option strategies for generating 1% monthly.

If you don't have a convenient broker that shows you how much the market is pricing in implied volatility like thinkorswim. Where you can see how much the underlying might move up or down within an options contract, you might have a ballpark area way. 

I'm going to show a picture of AAPL option chain. looking at the 15 sep 23 expiration where they are pricing about a 6 move up , and down,as you can see on the Top far right. To get the ball park area of about 6 price move you will have to look at the ask on the option chain.  I usually use the put side but the calls side work too.

We look at the ATM ask price, and add the itm ask price then we will get the ballpark number which in real time is a lot better. On the call side we have a 2.52(ATM) and add the 4.05(ITM)(on the ask) then we get a ballpark of what the market is pricing in right now , which is 6.57. this work for all underlyings i find a little more tricky on the 5 point spreads thought. 

More of what the market is pricing in love that number on the top right is a little skewed. Again this is what the buyers are targeting for their profit. Look at this bonus.

I remain bullish on all three in the short term and my expectation is that they will continue to rise as expiration approaches.   On that assumption, how do I determine whether I'm better off holding, or rolling to a longer expiration/higher strike?  I realize that rolling locks in my profits, and that a longer expiration pushes the worst of theta decay into the future.  But is it really that simple?  Is there no scenario where I'm better off, e.g., sitting tight, waiting for my exit return percentage, and cashing out, as opposed to rolling up and out?  Again, assuming the underlying securities still have some room to rise in the near term.  Delta for these options range from .51 to .72, in case that's of interest.  Thanks in advance!

2023-08-18,Early assignment of the short leg of my Bull Put Credit Spread. Looking for advice.,"Early assignment of the short leg of my Bull Put Credit Spread. Looking for advice. Hi everyone,

I've just got an assignment notification from my brokerage that the short leg of my Bull Put Credit Spread (**AAPL Sep01'23 185 Put)** has been assigned. It is a long position with a quantity of 300 AAPL shares at an average price of $185. 

I currently am unable to hold the shares as my account isn't big enough to do so.

What should I do? I read that I should create a Covered Stock Option and sell my 300 shares and close my long leg (**AAPL Sep01'23 180 Put)** and get back some extrinsic value.

On the other hand, as AAPL's last traded price is at $174.70, should I just exercise my long leg (AAPL Sep01'23 180 Put) and cancel out my long position of 300 shares? What is the benefit of doing so and is it worth considering?

I am new to options trading and I'm surprised that early assignment has happened so quickly to me.

Thanks for your input, it's greatly appreciated.",0.0,Neutral,English

Are there any instruments that are smaller denomination than this? Or are there other ways to take a similar trade with less capital at risk?  
One idea I had was to take a trade on an SP500 component that has high correlation to SPX, say for example ATM puts on AAPL are roughly half the price, is this recommended?

Another idea is buying OTM puts, but I'm concerned this is the type of strategy where I can still lose the trade even if I'm directionally correct.

Anyone got tips for improving trade executions for CBOE indices like SPX or VIX on TOS? You can route to ""BEST"" or ""CBOE,"" but what's the fastest way? Also, curious where GOOD TIL CANCEL orders are sitting after hours – on the CBOE exchange or TOS servers? if the GTC orders are on TOS servers, they may be resubmitted every day when the market opens. With each resubmission, your order essentially goes to the back of the line.

Lastly, what's the deal with OCO orders? Say you've got a 10-lot OCO for AAPL, and 1 leg fills 5 lots. The other resubmits for 5 lots, making you lose your place in the queue. Why can't they just cancel without resubmitting? Feels like this leads to slower, poorer executions. Anyone else experienced this or have insights? 🤔  


i.e: BUY 10 AAPL STRIKE A & B . 5 lot STRIKE A got filled. Strike B canceled everything and resubmitted a buy order for 5. so stupid. why cant they just cancel 5 lot for strike B ?

My strategy is usually about a week before to enter a position of Call +1/ Put -2, which usually evens out the pricing between the legs. Of those: 2 were breakeven, 18 were winners, and 17 were losers.

2023-08-03,"Earnings expected moves, Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Draftkings and more.","Earnings expected moves, Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Draftkings and more. A couple of giants report after the close, amidst a heavy earnings calendar. On the economic front, we get the NFP jobs number tomorrow morning.

Here's a preview of Amazon and the options setup, which can be a good sense of the overall set-up into an earnings event. The expected move is about 6%. That compares to the most recent earnings moves of -4%, -8%, -7% and +10%. So today's expected move is just shy of the mid of the past 4 earnings moves with the most recent earnings having moved less (-4%). 

The IV of the weeklies is about 100. That compares to the 30 day IV of about 43. Of course, the weekly options expire tomorrow, so really they should be thought of as an expected move, and less so as vega. That 30 day IV (44), which is a purer representation of vega, is higher than the 30 day realized vol (how the stock has actually moved over the past 30 days) of just 27. Amazon's realized vol over the past month is quite quiet compared to how its moved over the past year, with its yearly realized vol being 39. 

That paints a picture of very high IV compared to the stock's very recent history, but options priced for earnings that are leaning towards a move slightly less than the stock has moved over the past year on earnings. This comes in an overall lower IV and realized vol environment over the past few months.

An Iron Condor, set at the expected move, and $1 wide on the wings, would need AMZN to stay within about 120.50 and 136.50. The bullish expected move lines up very near to the highs of 2023 in the stock, which happened within the past month. Here's how that looks on the chart.

Apple's expected move of 3% compares to earnings moves over the past year of +5%, +3%, +8% and +3%. Again, low IV compared to earnings over the past year, but AAPL's realized vol over the past month is just 13! Options buyers have not been doing well in those conditions and the low IV into earnings is a reflection of that suffering. 3% is about $6 in either direction.

Here's some other highlights today:

2023-08-02,A Time Traveler's Strategy (Part 2) QQQ 1DTE ATM Problem.,"A Time Traveler's Strategy (Part 2) QQQ 1DTE ATM Problem. Part 1 is available at the link.[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/15byldr/a\_time\_travelers\_strategy\_long\_read\_followed\_by/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/15byldr/a_time_travelers_strategy_long_read_followed_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)I want to apologize for the very long text, but I didn't want to break this post into parts, as I consider the information it contains to be an inseparable whole.

**QQQ 1DTE ATM problem.**Probably the reason why I decided to start trading QQQ 1DTE requires some explanation.

It so happened that, with my background in trading, I have very little experience in trading on my own account. I had an open IBKR account, where I tried to conduct my experiments with options, in a quiet environment, and without unnecessary observers. The minimum amount of 25K was enough for me for these tasks, and I did not want to pump my personal account with large sums of money for investments. I reasoned that if something does not work on one lot, it is unlikely that it will work on 1000 lots. In general, I did not want to deposit more funds into the account than the amount I had initially allocated.As it became apparent to me that if you plan to steadily increase a small account, the main problem is the dispersion of the result. My initial strategy at that time was based on trading on my forecasts for short and medium term trends in stocks. And accordingly the dispersion reduction had to be done through diversification or, in other words, I had to simultaneously bet on a lot of securities in different directions and at the same time equalize the amount relative to the most expensive purchase. To put it mildly, the account amount of 25 000 dollars is not enough for such a game.

So I figured that with my small account it would be better for me to control the dispersion through a large number of consecutive attempts for a small amount of entry.It is quite natural that I came to the necessity to try to trade options on QQQ, because in this instrument the expiry occurs every working day, and at the same time each of my entries is easily equalized by the amount of the bet.

In the long run I could get the opportunity to make 200+ trades per year. That suited and inspired me.

So I started researching.

**The trading algorithm.**To begin with, I made a simple trading algorithm, which could be tested on past data and which could be easily reproduced in real trades.

Its essence is as follows.

At the close of the current trading day T0 in QQQ, I decide to buy a CALL or PUT option with expiration on the next day T1 or 1DTE ATM.

In the tests I take the calculated strike which is equal to the closing price of T0 (it is not difficult to transfer it to trades using the real closest to the calculated strike ATM).

The next day I have to place an order, which is in the system for the whole trading day T1.

I control the fact of order execution by internal cost.

With this approach I have only 3 options to close my open trade.

\-The order is executed at the price I set and I make a profit.

\- My order is not executed and the value of the option at the end of the trading day becomes equal to 0 and I get a loss = option premium paid by me.

\-The order is not executed but the value of the option at the close of trading is different from zero and I get some money back. At the same time, I do not know whether I close the trade in plus or minus, because it will depend on the point at which tomorrow's market closes on day T1.I checked the reproducibility of the test algorithm in real trades while I had such an opportunity.

And thus I need to find the answer to two questions

1-Call or PUT

2- At what price to place a Take-profit order.

**Direction Indicator.**For tests, I made an indicator, the direction of which I was going to predict. Of course, I could try to guess the direction of the closing price on the day T1, but I wanted to leave myself some room to optimize the Take-profit order in advance.

I called this indicator Vol+-, which is equal to the largest absolute value of the extremum of the current trading day, from the closing price of the previous day, expressed as a percentage and taken with its own + or - sign. According to the value of this indicator I can determine the maximum possible profit for 1 day on the purchased option.

here's the formula.Vol + - \_t1 = IF abs (High\_t1 - Close\_t0)> abs(Low\_t1- Close\_t0) then (High\_t1 - Close\_t0)/ Close\_t0\*100 else (Low\_t1- Close\_t0)/Close\_to\* 100.

**Calculating 1DTE ATM option price**

Also for the tests I need to know the price of the QQQ option 1DTE ATM for the calculated strike.

Here I made a rough assumption.

if the price as a percentage of the value of the underlying asset for the central Call SPY 1DTE ATM = Vix\*vega

Then for QQQ I have experimentally found that Call QQQ 1DTE ATM = 1.5 \* Vix \* vega or 1.5 \*0.0209 \* Vix and this as a percentage of the underlying asset price.

*Again. I realize that the statement that Central IV QQQ = 1.5\*Vix is a very rough assumption, but it is not a fatal error affecting the results of my research.*

**A period of collecting statistics and waiting for revenue.**

I took the time period from January 2, 2020 to February 2, 2023 to research and gather statistics. There are a total of 778 trading days.

The VIX range for this period was from 12.2 to 82.7.

I immediately looked at what would happen in the case of 100% guessing the direction of my indicator.

The result, is given as a fraction of the option value. The graph of profit with the cumulative total of 778 points for me turned out as follows.

https://preview.redd.it/2beo0gyy7qfb1.jpg?width=879&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bfb856330b7dd60e0bfb45583cc35789f57f270

The Vol +- result is the absolute maximum, the Close result implies that there is no Take-profit order in the trades, and all I get is the result at the closing price on the day T1.

From these positions I was satisfied with everything. Even at the Close price the result was quite acceptable, and there was still a good window for Take-profit optimization.

So I started searching for a way to predict the priority direction of tomorrow.

**Direction Prediction.**

There is a stable opinion that daily deviations on the market are distributed randomly.

During the test period of 778 trading days the number of closures greater than 0 amounted to 430 or 55.3%.  348 days or 47.7% closed in the red zone.

I have decided right away that I will look for a solution only in the market statistics. It is unlikely that trend analysis, technical or fundamental analysis will help me in predicting 1 day ahead.

In order to narrow down the infinite range of market data, I first thought about what tomorrow's priority direction is. And I really liked the analogy that I would have to predict the MOOD of tomorrow's market at the close of today's trading day.

And somehow right away I decided on my search categories.

1- Seasonality. Mood obviously depends on the day of the week, and the mood on Wednesday will of course be significantly different from the mood on Friday. I collected statistics depending on the day of the week (at some point in my research, I also used the quarter number as seasonality).

2- Past. Well just like seasonality obviously mood is influenced by the not-too-distant past. Which means I need to consider the statistics of the previous few days of trading for the underlying asset.

3-External news background or external information at the close of the current day. Here I am a supporter of the postulate of technical analysis that all news background is embedded in prices. This means that I need to include in the analysis several instruments traded on the market (it is not clear yet which ones) that provide information about the market background.

4-Information that comes to the market from the closing of the current day to the opening of the next day. It is a random value and it is absolutely impossible to predict it.

Thus, I have formed an image of the desired search result.

If we take into account that the first three points 100% determine the market mood, and the 4th point is overlaid with an additional layer has 50% probability to confirm or deny the forecast, and closes no more than 50% of all trading days. For me, it means that a well-tuned system should give at least 75% of hits, otherwise I will always doubt it.

**Predicting a ""Random"" Value.**

Since I was only interested in direction, I converted the entire parameter array at closing time T0 and the predicted output parameter Vol+ -\_T1 into the format +1 and -1, where

\+1 upward movement

\-1 downward movement.

I took the day of the week as a sequence from 1 to 5 (Monday through Friday),

Quarter, respectively, from 1 to 4.

Collecting statistics for the 778 points was also easy, I simply counted the number of +1 and -1 for the output parameter for different combinations of input parameters.

Initially I worked with a 778\*34 massif, and tried to set the influence of each input parameter separately.

And of course I got nothing. That is, as described above, I was unable to find any statistically significant patterns. In this data representation everything really looks like a random sequence.

It probably doesn't matter now how exactly I came to this decision and how long it took.

But it was physics and playing roulette in a casino that put me on the right track).

Physics helped me in that I realized that sometimes non-random quantities can masquerade as random quantities.

A prime example is the establishment of the wave nature of the electron (Thompson's 1927 experiment). Diffraction of an electron beam on a suitable lattice.

After all, if you shoot bullets from a machine gun onto a lattice with one slit and shoot a beam of electrons, the distribution behind the slit will be Gaussian and the same for both experiments.

But if we add a second slit, then only the machine gun will keep the Gaussian distribution behind the lattice, and the electron will show its wave nature.

All that remains is to attach the second slit to the +1 and -1 directions for QQQ.)))

This is where the casino came to my rescue, namely a roulette game with Red and Black bets.

Technically, coming to the casino, you can make such a bet not in two ways - red or black, but in four ways Red, Black, Same as last time, Opposite of what happened last time. In the case of the casino, our probability is not changed by such manipulations. The question is, what changes for QQQ?

I've moved on from the data presentation format

\+1 up

\-1 down

to a format

\+1 up after down

\+2 up after up

\-2 down after up

\-1 down after down

Since when processing statistics I count the number of outcomes, the indexing can be any, including letter indexes, I did it the way it was convenient for me.

The result exceeded all my expectations. If earlier in the period of statistics processing of 778 trading days absolutely nothing worked for me, now absolutely everything worked for me))). For the sake of experiment I even checked the influence of solar activity and also got some regularities in the period of statistics collection.

At that moment I tried to determine the influence of each parameter separately on the QQQ direction and used double seasonality - day of the week and number of the quarter.

I checked the collected statistics on a test period starting from the trading date of February 3, 2023.

And then I made two conclusions. (identified two problems)

1-I get a lot of false patterns (the incoming parameter, which in the period of statistics collection gives me the required 75% probability, in the test period turns into 50/50).

2- even those patterns that I can identify as true do not give me a continuous forecasting process. That is, I get a very discrete set of predictions, and I cannot make a prediction for every day.

How I solved these problems is quite difficult to put into words.

First, I will share my preliminary thoughts, and then I will tell you exactly what I did.

So, when deciding to enter a trade, we all look at a monitor that shows us the same numbers and values, but each of us only sees a unique combination of those numbers. The answer to the question of where the market will go depends on the superposition of all the views of the participants. Accordingly, in order to make a forecast, I must understand how this superposition is distributed, and making my own prediction is unnecessary and even harmful. That is, I must make a forecast without making a prediction.

In a competition between farmers to determine the weight of a steer at a glance, the same person invariably won. And the winner was not the most experienced farmer, but the secretary of the competition, who simply bookmarked the predictions of all the participants and calculated the average value. It is possible that this person could not distinguish a bull from a cow, but his forecast was always the most accurate, and he invariably won the contest.

*The way I see it, this is what Nassim Nicholas Taleb is talking about in his lengthy arguments about just buying options, and if you find a reason to buy an option, the result is instantly spoiled.*

**A Machine Learning algorithm based on statistical data, with two-stage validation and feature engineering.**Well yes that is exactly the correct name for what I ended up doing.

I put together a data set of 13 incoming parameters that are categorized:

https://preview.redd.it/3uq2s7f28qfb1.jpg?width=793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be6359e0beaaf3021d1c7998ad7f43150706d1ef

all data are in the format +1\_+2\_-2\_-1

Total of 13 input parameters, from which I have collected a matrix of combinations by the degree of parameter use. Accordingly, in the beginning I took a combination when none of the parameters is used and ended with a combination when I use all the parameters. *In other words, I am not trying to establish exactly how UST5 affects the direction of QQQ, but I am investigating the effect of all combinations that contain UST5, and of course the effect of those combinations that do not contain UST5.*

It is not difficult to calculate that I got 8192 unique combinations.

https://preview.redd.it/4y6hrkwk8qfb1.jpg?width=766&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16096436b60af748c458bb30c56b1fec23de82c6

in the table the sign 0 - if the parameter is used, 1 - if the parameter is not used

Then everything is simple, (especially if you invented it yourself).

For the first time validation period for each trading day, all 8192 combinations are run, each of which separately forms a signal based on the period of collecting statistics on 778 trading days (learning period), in the learning period for each unique combination forms a final signal based on 75% probability. This run took me 6.5 hours of machine time.

And every time I thank myself that I did not decide to analyze the influence of S&P 500 components and limited myself to only 13 input parameters, because each new added input parameter increases all previously spent calculation time on the first validation period exactly in 2 times)). Keep this in mind when conducting your own tests on your home laptop.

Having obtained statistics for each of the 8192 combinations at the first validation period, I performed some clever manipulations (I left those combinations that gave a result for the first validation period greater than 75% and threw out those that gave exactly 100%). Here I had to eliminate false patterns. These logical manipulations in a language I don't speak are properly called feature engineering. In the end, I was left with 358 combinations, which I checked simultaneously on the first and second validation period. The final signal was formed as a superposition of signals for each trading day from the 358 combinations I found, which individually form a signal according to the same 778 points of statistics collection with the same criterion of 75%. As a result of all the actions performed, the probabilities of hitting on two validation periods coincided.

And voila I have a predictive system that gives a hit probability of predicting the direction of tomorrow no worse than 75%.

Well, now it is clear where AI creators for the stock market should dig and what kind of shovel they should choose.

Without thinking much about optimization I made a trading pencil test where the starting account was 10,000, limit per trade $1000. And the account profile for 120 trading days looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/3u29w9vg8qfb1.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c691d8fbe75a54d9ea20e61eb27800231a6ed52

and this despite the fact that in these calculations I closed my open deals at the worst variant - at the closing price of the next day.

I have always been of the opinion that if you start to invent something, you should immediately try to make money in real trading. It is possible to learn all the secrets of the universe in parallel with the fascinating process of making profit.

If I had not been disconnected from options trading at the time of my discovery, I would have indulged in pleasant thoughts about the advantages and disadvantages of buying a vertical spread before buying a simple ATM option, followed by a Take-profit order. And then I would briefly ponder, at what point I realize that my system has failed and it's time for me to return some of the money spent on the option premium through a Stop-Loss order.In any case, I liked this chart very much.

It's no problem for me to write a technical task, order a trading robot, so that sitting in the evenings in a beach bar, once a month to check the status of your option account in a mobile phone application, realizing that you have organized a decent pension and passive income for only $10,000 at the risk of losing only $1,000 a day. And i do all this while the rest of us continue to watch the trades in real time.

I probably wouldn't even be writing these posts.

But life has taken a different course. Bidding on my own account was closed to me. So I took the first step.

I ran my model through Kelly Criterion.

I can't even imagine what kind of games John Larry Kelly Jr. played. So that the mathematical expectation is positive, and the probability is known, and the exact payoff in case of success is known.

But I got one thing right.

Kelly criterion allows you to determine how well your game strategy is assembled. To do this, you need to assume that you bet a percentage of your own account every time.

If everything is OK, your income profile starts to resemble a geometric progression function (many people call it an exponent).

I didn't get trifled with and in the test calculations I left the starting amount of $10,000, removed the limit on one bet, and set the bet level as a percentage of the account at 25% of the account.

Result:

https://preview.redd.it/vtpuw3s48qfb1.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d63a911b2bdf85e89649d2e9ee1d6a41804c859

Well, this chart does not look like an ""exponential"". This means that it is time for me to comprehend the mysteries of the universe and finally solve the riddle of the time traveler's trading strategy from 1997.

2023-07-29,programmable system to trade options(all failed ideas),"programmable system to trade options(all failed ideas) I am a 48 years old programmer, I have been learning and buying options and stocks. most options are OTM calls, as I learned the non-linear payoff is the key for retailer. I am trying to establish a programmable system to trade options so that I can live on the cash I have . I have tested out IBKR api to monitor data and send orders.

&#x200B;

given the maturity of the market, I am going through lots of ideas. I have not found one that seems to convince me it will work. as I am full believer of Taleb philosophy, We can only falsify and proof by negate, if there is such idea that can succeed, more than likely I have not tried hard enough to falsify it.

I hope to gain some idea from you guys. I am not selling volatility ever.

1. volatility surface calibration, get tick price from IBKR, based on bid size and ask size, to get reasonable price and using STI model to calibrate volatility surface. then buy options with low volatility. reason fail, volatility of underlying may change rapidly and also some major event may be in the near future, not sure why the academic is obsessed with volatility surface calibration. do you see a way to success? last price of option may not be accurate, give the size of trade, and also MM may be overrun by insiders.
2. I see lots of trade flow monitor site, I believe institutional traders can use program to divide large block into small size. or insider( some executive from biotech company) may place large size bet on options, but is this going to be reliable? some site even promote large block size on AAPL,  AAPL is so liquid that I don't think anyone has any insider information, within last 5 years, AAPL has never made some jumps based on nonpublic information, and they may using calls as a hedge.  so this flow alone can not be reliable.
3. one more thing to try based on 1 and 2, detect large size trade with higher volatility trade , then buying other further out calls with lower strike.
4. maintain a book , with options and stocks, calculate all the greeks, based on volatility surface calibration, not based simply on BS formula. I see Taleb book on dynamic hedging, it involves 7th derivatives, I think that can only be calculated using real data. using programming skills, it is easy to see it is delta neutral, maybe 2nd  or 3rd derivative neutral, maybe this is why the volatility surface is so important, given current surface, the risk of the portfolio is know more  accurately.
5. another way is to play the distribution, i.e, extrapolate the prob. dist. of underlying over 2sd, and using power law to calibrate prob. out of 2 sd, then recalculate option price. one to see it is to use the DTE as one unit of time, say you have 300 day dte, just treat that as one unit of time and estimate the prob. of change of underlying to fit the option price, with computer age, with a prob. dist. of different unit time, option price is easy to calc.
6. market dynamics is not something we play as retailer, and I don't want to speculate, like NVDA gained 25% post earning.

I understand building such a system without any speculation view of the market is extremely hard for retailer,   the process of thinking about and falsifying ideas has somehow made me better understand market risks.

2023-07-22,TQQQ wheeled to success! (Finally),"TQQQ wheeled to success! (Finally) I had the idea to run a wheel strategy on TQQQ ETF which had mixed feedback from the reddit community. I'm back over a year later to share my story. 

TL/DR. Made 40% realized gains after suffering for over a year holding a bag. 

The strategy:

Sell OTM puts until I get assigned then sell calls on assigned shares until called away. Also buy back contract's after 50% profit and re sell again.



1/24/22: Sold first put contract on TQQQ which at the time was trading around 50-55 dollars a share that day. 2 contracts at a 30 strike with 60 DTE. 







Premium collected $275.


I continued to successfully sell put contracts for 4 months without facing assignment.



5/23/22: I got assigned on two of my 40 strike put contacts, giving me 200 shares of TQQQ worth $8000. (Fun and games are over, it's about to get real.)









Premium collected so far: $1557.27

3/20022-1/2023 TQQQ got absolutely annihilated with tech stocks crashing hard. The leveraged ETF got battered down as low as $16 a share. I refused to sell call contracts lower than my assignment price so I finally understood what it was meant to be ""holding the bag"". 








I was at a $4800 unrealized loss on the position at one point.

I was able to sell some calls as the price fluctuated, and against my better judgement I sold some more puts at 15-20 strike prices occasionally,










Premium collected so far: 2214.61

7/21/23 TQQQ 42 call contracts expired in the money, calling away my 200 shares. $8400 put back into my account. The wheel has finally come full circle over a year later...









Final premium collected: $2769.49 Premium plus stock value increase gain:




$3169.49









Wow what a wild ride that was. I never watched my money drop so quickly and it took all my self control not to bail out on the position early, or sell calls way under my assignment price. Will I continue to sell puts now and keep the wheel rolling? I don't know if it's worth it. Anyway hope you guys enjoy. Shout out to r/thetagang",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-07-20,"Expected moves, Tesla, Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, Capital One and more.","Expected moves, Tesla, Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, Capital One and more. * Futures lower. 
* QQQ -0.70%, SPY -0.25% 
* Tesla and Netflix are both lower, but both within the expected move (thus far)

One of the things to look for as earnings season heats up is whether companies that miss see buyers below. We're about to get a test of underlying strength in the market with both Netflix and Tesla are lower on earnings. The two companies were the first mega-cap tech stocks to report this cycle. And most mega-cap stocks rallied into earnings season. If these companies miss, and find buyers below, the stocks will stay above their expected move levels, indicating an underlying bid in these stocks, folks that may have missed some of this rally, and now see a chance to get in. Obviously support levels are interesting spots to watch, but the options market provides another consistent one, the expected move. If the stocks continue lower, and close the day below their expected move (into earnings) it may indicate some buyer exhaustion, with buyers unwilling to step in or defend levels that were expected on a miss.

Often, expected moves line up with recent resistance and support. Here's an example in ISRG, reporting today, and an Iron Condor based on Friday's expected move that leans on a very recent low in the stock:

2023-07-18,"Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.","Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more. The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM. JPM has also performed the best from the bank stocks that reported last week, initially giving up its earnings move gains but recovering much of them with a strong up day yesterday. Goldman reports tomorrow and then the focus shifts quickly to mega-cap tech after the bell tomorrow with Netflix and Tesla kicking things off. On the economic data front advance retail sales missed estimates this morning.

**Chart of the Day:** Netflix options are pricing about a 7.6% move, a move larger than 4 out of its last 8 earnings moves (2 moves were 20%+). A $5 wide Iron condor expiring Friday, set at the expected move would need the stock to stay between about $413 and $487 to see profits. That $413 level is pretty much the low end of the range NFLX has traded in the past month.

SPY was higher by 2.5% last week. A much larger move than options were pricing. Vol remains low across the board. To start this week the futures are pulling back a bit and with that, the VIX is starting the week off around 14 (the historical mean is around 19). This is the first full week of earnings season. Tomorrow we get a second round of big bank reports when we hear from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (Goldman is a day later) as well as a look into online brokerage with Schwab and Interactive Brokers. On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.

A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week.

2023-07-14,"Expected moves, JP Morgan Citi, Wells Fargo, and a look ahead to Tesla","Expected moves, JP Morgan Citi, Wells Fargo, and a look ahead to Tesla In what is the first important look at a sector of the market during the fresh earnings season, the big bank trio of JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi are all higher after reporting this morning. Blackrock is slightly lower. The other big name to report this morning, United Health is higher. As options traders, we're of course looking at more than direction. The magnitude of these moves is equally if not more important. As mentioned over the past week, we enter earnings season with some of the lowest IV we've seen in years, and expected moves for earnings the smallest we've seen in over a decade. JP Morgan options were pricing a 2.4% move, the stock is higher by 2.7% or so pre-market. Wells Fargo options were pricing about a 3% move, the stock is higher by about 3.1%. Citi options were pricing in about a 3% move and the stock is higher by about 1.6%. So options had the moves more or less correct on average, with JPM beating the expected move and Citi inside the move. As a rule of thumb about 70% of the time stocks should be at or inside the expected move on earnings. And of course, that stat is marked to the end of the day for stocks that report before the bell so the jury is still out on today. But it is something to keep a mental note of, whether we begin to see moves beyond the expected move or if options have it right, even at this low level of vol. As it could inform trade decisions, including holding positions into earnings as the vol collapse is quite different than it normally is.

Additionally, and especially as we start to hear from some tech stocks that have had a really good couple of months, are the moves to the upside the ones we see stocks beat, and are moves to the downside safer because there's an underlying bid in large parts of the market? Something to keep an eye on.

Stocks finished lower last week, with the SPY down about 1%, just slightly more than with options were pricing for the holiday-shortened week. The bigger story for options was that implied vol did begin to pick up a bit. The VIX finished the week at about 15.50. That's up from the multi-year lows in the VIX the last week fo June that saw the index below 13. SPY weekly vol also saw a pick-up with the weeklies now 11-12 vol, up from 9-10 we saw with vol at its lows. Coming out of the holiday things stay interesting with economic data while earnings make a return to the scene. On the economic data front, things are a bit quiet the first two days of the week with a few FOMC member speeches on the docket. On Wednesday things pick up with the CPI release, followed on Thursday by the PPI, giving us a good update on inflation. Then on Friday we get a check on the consumer with the UoM consumer sentiment number. Also on Thursday into Friday the story quickly shifts to earnings as a couple of big reports kick off the new season. On Thursday we hear from Pepsi and Delta Airlines, but that's just the warm-up to Friday morning with reports from JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Blackrock and more.

I wonder how useful these Bid-Ask values are for backtesting. I believe they are giving me only **end of day** bid-ask values. I would guess bid-ask at end of day are substantially wider than during the trading day (when I will actually be making my trades in real trading). In this case, the daily options data seems of limited use.

For instance, even with ITM strikes I'm seeing AAPL options with bid-ask spreads at 3% or even more. This seems crazy high.

2023-07-09,List of Platforms (Not Brokers) for advanced option trading,"List of Platforms (Not Brokers) for advanced option trading Quite often is see people asking about option trading platforms and brokers as they are the same thing.  But there are a number of broker neutral platforms out there which offer much more flexibility for advanced traders.  Many retail brokers will force you to use their execution platform, but some allow you to pick your own, such as LightSpeed and DashPrime.  

These platforms will come at an extra cost, maybe only a couple of hundred dollars more a month, some are much more, but they can offer quite a bit of information and ability to do many different types of trades.

For example, I can see advanced Time and Sales information such as what type of trade took place, what exchange, whether it was hedged with stock or options, etc.  I can see all orders in an exchanges COB (complex order book) arranged by edge, and can easily trade with each order.  I can direct route orders to any of the 16 options exchanges or use several different types of smart routes. I can see end of the day order imbalances. I can easily create multi legged order and save order boxes for them.  I can automatically trade options in different stocks together or stocks themselves.  I can trade based on vol.  I can hedge with stock automatically when I make a trade.  If there is any problem with a trade, I can reach someone on the phone in 2 rings.  My system is extremely stable as well and never goes down.

Other possibilities with some of these platforms is the ability to easy write your own algos and advanced scripting.  Advanced risk management and option analysis.  Also easy API connectivity with help setting up. These are just some of the features.  

Here are a list of different platforms if you want to check them out yourself.  Some are more for institutional, but some will work well for an advanced retail trader.  I'm sure there are more out there, but looking at these will give you an idea what is possible.

The company has now received the first set of confirmatory data which demonstrates that T cells which express the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct targeting CD19 and expressing siRNA for NR2F6 were  successfully created. In addition, the siRNA that is designed into the CAR T-cell was very highly expressed.  Subsequent studies will determine if the expression of NR2F6 mRNA is suppressed or enhanced as a result of the high expression of siRNA.

""This is a major accomplishment in moving this model forward into therapies because in order to test whether we can genetically manipulate NR2F6 levels, we have to be able to produce a CAR T-cell where we demonstrate expression of this siRNA,"" says Dr. Harry Lander, Chief Scientific Consultant to the company. ""We are excited to see the results on NR2F6 expression.  If it is inhibited, we will focus on using these DuraCAR cells as originally envisioned - to attack solid tumors.  If it is enhanced, we will begin re-tooling these cells to treat autoimmune disorders.""

""We are delighted to get our first dataset from an independent CRO which shows that the CAR T-cells are doing what we expect and look forward to the next set of data which will inform us about the disease areas, whether autoimmunity or cancer, we will focus on,"" says Dr. David Koos, Chairman and CEO of the company.

 Toronto, Ontario, and New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - September 20, 2023) - Sekur Private Data Ltd. (CSE: SKUR) (OTCQX: SWISF) (FSE: GDT0) (""Sekur"" or the ""Company""), a leading Swiss hosted secure and private communications platform, is pleased to announce that new subscriber signups for its Swiss hosted privacy VPN, [SekurVPN,](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/LGWwRUYbrx) has increased by over 100% month-over-month.

Sekur is registering a surge in signups for its VPN solution, as cyberattacks become more and more commonplace and digital identity theft is rampant. The Company expects exponential growth in the coming months and years for its SekurVPN solution and is adding enterprise features and other upgrades such as IPv6, the next generation Internet Protocol (IP) standard intended to eventually replace IPv4, the protocol many Internet services still use today. Sekur plans to launch a full-scale campaign for its VPN solution sometime in late October or early November as it is preparing the final touches on its digital ads. There are other plans as well with resellers to launch SekurVPN later this year.

Additionally, Sekur is pleased to report that website traffic for [Sekur.com](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/oLorOuwrnD) has increased by approximately 100% in the last month and by 650% in the last two weeks, and is registering a conversion rate of 5% on its organic search site visits. The Company believes that in the coming 12 months, its web traffic will be such that its customer acquisition cost could drop down dramatically as the organic search increases exponentially. As Sekur increases SMB marketing to businesses, spending per customer is expected to increase as SMBs have multiple users in their business. Spending per user is also expected to increase as the Company launches its SekurVoice voice calls encrypted solutions and SekurPRO, its video conferencing and complete private and secure communications suite, in Q1 2024.

Alain Ghiai, CEO of Sekur Private Data, said: ""We are very pleased with the surge in SekurVPN signups in the last month. Sales have surpassed our expectations by far and we are now expecting exponential growth for [SekurVPN.](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/O32YEfYmNP) The results also do not reflect yet the full scale launch as we have just completed a prelaunch and are testing the waters. We expect this to be a big success once we launch it on social media and digital paid media. Our prime directive is to provide private and secure communications for everyone, and as we are not connected to any Big Tech platform we offer a truly independent, private and secure means of communications, without any data mining, through our proprietary technology and our secure servers based in Switzerland. We look forward to continuing to offer true data privacy to all individuals and their businesses, and to protect their intellectual property and privacy from data miners and malicious hackers.""

Since the Company has added SekurVPN and customized ""à la carte"" bundles for consumers and businesses, approximately 50% of all customers have been buying bundles with 32% of customers purchasing SekurVPN in the bundle or on its own.

On April 7, 2023, the Company launched SekurVPN, its privacy VPN solution available through [Sekur.com](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/PLw0guXx2g), and began commercial sales of its highly anticipated privacy and security VPN solution. The solution is also offered for sale in USD, CAD, NZD, AUD, SGD, CHF, EUR and GPB. Sekur plans to do a full scale launch before year-end 2023 with several videos on social media promoting SekurVPN to select targeted audiences in the U.S. Ghiai discusses the advantages of having a privacy VPN, and other preventive measures to minimize cyberattacks for consumers and businesses, on [Sekur Hack of the Week Episode](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/wW1QVIQw2r), a nationwide TV show broadcast on NewsmaxTV, Fox Business and on streaming media.

SekurVPN is especially meant for privacy enthusiasts and users wanting to protect their identity from hackers. An example would be users going to their e-banking or shopping online, using their emails, using messaging applications and wanting to have full privacy and protection from hackers hijacking their IP location and signal. The service guarantees not to use Big Tech or hyperscalers for its functioning or hosting, and it guarantees that there are no third party bundles sold with it so no data is leaked or sold to third parties. It guarantees no traffic pulling or monitoring and no phone number is required to register to the service.

According to a [Forbes article](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/gOPgBFmGYj), 66% of surveyed internet users within the U.S. use a VPN to help protect personal data, 80% use a VPN for increased security and 33% use a VPN to mask their internet activity. More statistics can be found on this [VPN Statistics And Trends In 2023](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/pEoVOfjALn) article.

**Private:**

[SekurVPN](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/Gmw5GSRwkm) uses its own proprietary infrastructure and does not use any hyperscaler or Big Tech hosting providers, unlike most other VPNs. SekurVPN offers Swiss IPs only. This guarantees that it is using only SekurVPN's own servers and routing. Other VPNs offer hundreds of locations and are using Big Tech providers, compromising users' privacy. SekurVPN never monitors users' activity and never shares any data with third party service providers. By being a pure VPN, without bundled outside services such as antivirus and ad blockers, SekurVPN keeps users' information private without sharing their data with third party service providers. With SekurVPN, users do not register their phone number on the app or the web, rendering users invisible from hackers or snoopers. No phone number to register, anonymous Swiss IPs only, no data mining or traffic sharing with anyone.

**Secure:**

SekurVPN's secure VPN routes all your internet traffic through SekurVPN's privately owned servers, in multiple locations in Switzerland only, using the highest encryption industry standards combined with its proprietary HeliX technology for added security. Encryption keys are not stored on devices and are unique at every connection. Users' passwords, confidential data and internet surfing stay encrypted even over public untrusted internet connections.

**Easy to use:**

SekurVPN is extremely easy to setup and deploy. There is no country list and our interface is simplified; just tap or click the connection button. SekurVPN's no-frills but highly secure and private service gives users peace of mind without thinking about geolocations.

Currently SekurVPN is available to use with MacOS, iOS and Android devices. Versions for Windows 64, Windows 32 and Linux are planned to be launched in the coming weeks.

In addition to [SekurVPN](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/QOwRgFDnMQ), the company offers a bundled Sekur plan, which includes [SekurMessenger](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/m3LXOfN8J2) and[ SekurMail](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/kOmREFzm2w) as a bundle of email, messaging and file transfer into one application, and includes the Company's latest SekurMail technology, which includes a proprietary anti-phishing and privacy feature called SekurSend**®.** SekurSend**®** lets a user send an email to any other recipient, whether they have [Sekur](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/BpMGntJg7n) or not, in full privacy and security as the email never leaves [Sekur](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/55mAJTVMaL)'s encrypted email servers based in Switzerland. The recipient can then click on the notification and reply in the same manner using SekurReply**®**, without the recipient having to register for a [Sekur](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/LGWwRUYbre) account. The sender can also decide to protect any email sent by adding a password to open it, a read-limit and a self-destruct timer as well. Sending an email with the SekurSend**®** feature allows the senders and recipients to add limitless size attachments to the emails without crowding the recipients' email box. This also eliminates BEC attacks for businesses and email phishing attacks. Additionally, SekurMail includes full control of email delivery, automatic data export for large enterprises and an automatic Data Loss Prevention technology (""DLP"") with real time continuous archiving.

Recent data breaches in messaging applications have created a certain urgency for businesses and data privacy advocates to protect their communications from cyberattacks and identity theft via mobile and desktop devices.

[SekurMessenger](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/oLorOuwrnk) comes with a proprietary feature and technology called ""Chat-By-Invite."" This feature allows a [SekurMessenger](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/O32YEfYmNW) user (""SM user"") to invite via email or SMS a non-SM user, or a group of non-SM users, to chat in a fully private and secure way without the recipient ever having to register to [SekurMessenger](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/PLw0guXx21) or download the app. At the end of the chat, the initiator of the conversation can remotely terminate the conversation and all traces of the conversation are deleted from all users, including the recipient. This unique feature is now fully deployed and functional on all iOS and Android devices and web platforms. The target sectors are numerous, including but not limited to real estate, legal, finance, insurance, medical, government, energy, manufacturing, trade and pharmaceutical sectors.

[SekurMessenger](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/wW1QVIQw2z) also eliminates many of the privacy and security risks by not requiring a phone number, which would divulge a user's phone device ID, but also by not social engineering a user's phone or computer contact list and infecting the contacts by default as well, eliminating a huge loophole in security and privacy. [SekurMessenger](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/gOPgBFmGYX) issues each user a username and a Sekur number. The Sekur number is the contact ID a user would disclose in order for other Sekur users to be added. The service comes with a self-destruct timer and other features as well, including Sekur's proprietary VirtualVaults and HeliX technologies with all data stored in Swiss hosted encrypted servers.

Sekur's Data privacy solutions are all hosted in Switzerland, protecting users' data from any outside data intrusion requests. In Switzerland, the right to privacy is guaranteed in article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The Federal Act on Data Protection (""FADP"") of 19 June 1992 (in force since 1993) has set up a strict protection of privacy by prohibiting virtually any processing of personal data which is not expressly authorized by the data subjects. The protection is subject to the authority of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.

Under Swiss federal law, it is a crime to publish information based on leaked ""secret official discussions."" In 2010, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland found that IP addresses are personal information and that under Swiss privacy laws they may not be used to track internet usage without the knowledge of the individuals involved.

2023-09-08,Pennies with Potential: 3 must-watch stocks under $1 for a portfolio,"Pennies with Potential: 3 must-watch stocks under $1 for a portfolio Penny stocks, which are frequently priced around $5 and have the potential for rapid gains and market-beating returns, are popular among day traders. They may provide as a platform for emerging or failing firms to make a profit. They do, however, come with a lot of volatility and speculation, which can lead to big gains. For example, after Liberty Safe was chastised for FBI-related behavior, American Rebel's safe subsidiary Champion Safe was chastised. AREB shares rose from less than a dollar on Wednesday to $1.99 on Thursday morning. Other low-cost stocks, such as Kaixin Auto, have experienced significant price fluctuations in the absence of news or business communications. Investors should be aware of the catalysts driving these stocks' prices, as well as any upcoming events that may affect their prices, in order to make an informed decision on whether to acquire or avoid these stocks.

While penny stocks might be lucrative, they are not for the faint of heart. Investors should conduct due investigation, understand the dangers involved, and be prepared to lose their entire investment.

* Patent Filed on Artificial Intelligence Smart Battery Technology for ZenaDrone 1000 and Electric Airplanes

**On June 13th EPAZ announced the company's subsidiary, Galaxy Batteries, Inc., has filed its first patent on artificial intelligence smart battery technology.**

AI smart battery technology gathers data from the environment including wind speed, humidity, temperance, and pressure to predict the best output for the system to perform to maximum flight time in the case of the EPAZ ZenaDrone 1000 and maximum battery duration or battery life for other devices.

As the EPAZ ZenaDrone 1000 flies long distances, the weather and environment will change; the system monitoring the conditions will automatically make the necessary changes. The AI smart battery can change output and voltage. It will also monitor the battery temperature and battery health. It will maintain a history of each battery pack. However, the data will be uploaded to the cloud. As the EPAZ ZenaDrone and other devices enter the market, the AI smart battery will use the data from all flights to maximum flight time.

**EPAZ has formed a subsidiary Galaxy Batteries, Inc. to house its intellectual properties for battery technology. EPAZ has been working on special battery technologies for high-powered devices and aircraft. EPAZ is in the process of filing patents for its battery technology and believes in the future Galaxy Batteries can become an independent company.**

* ZenaDrone Inc. 1000's AI Prediction Has Gained Interest from Native American Tribes After the RES 2023 in Las Vegas 

**On May 16th EPAZ announced its ZenaDrone 1000 has gained the interest of Native American tribes after the RES 2023 held in Las Vegas. EPAZ attended the trade show to share how the ZenaDrone 1000 can provide services for search and rescue, firefighting, cargo delivery, and land surveys.**

EPAZ is currently scheduling demos for the U.S. Military, NATO partners, Irish farmers, the German police force, the German rail, and Native American tribes. ZenaDrone's expanded facility will have the capacity to manufacture over 30 drones per month once the facility is fully in production. 

* EPAZ Filing a Series of AI Patents for Its Drone and Battery Technology

**On May 9th EPAZ announced that the company is in the process of filing a series of artificial intelligence (AI) patents for its drone technology. EPAZ has already received two patents for its drone technology, and two other patents are under review with the US Patent Office. EPAZ has also filed for international patents.**

EPAZ has developed a new process for increasing the flight time of its holdings, ZenaDrone 1000, which innovatively provides an opportunity to file for new patents. Furthermore, the process requires a custom battery management system that uses AI to monitor and analyze the fight characteristics of the ZenaDrone 1000.

ZenaDrone 1000 is a heavy lift drone requiring special configuration. EPAZ uses AI to track current flights and analyze previous flights to understand how to improve the drone's flight times.

The EPAZ ZenaDrone 1000 team will use predictive AI analytics and predictive modeling -- a type of analysis that employs methods and resources -- to create predictive models and forecast future outcomes based on acquired data. Predictive analytics refers to a method rather than a specific technology, and it uses techniques including machine learning algorithms, sophisticated mathematics, statistical modeling, descriptive analytics, and data mining. EPAZ will prioritize upgrading the ZenaDrone 1000's AI technology to increase its global reach across industries.

* Low-Cost Augmented Reality Glasses for On-Site Remote Assist Product

**On May 4th EPAZ announced that the company has developed low-cost Augmented Reality Smart Glasses call Stacklens. EPAZ Stacklens are durable and comfortable augmented reality glasses as well as smart glasses for its holdings in Tillerstack’s onsite remote-assisted product.**

Stacklens will be under $400 per pair of glasses, while other competitors are selling their glasses for over $2,000 per pair. EPAZ decided to develop its own glasses because it caused sticker shock for customers and potential customers in Europe who wanted to use the technology and because the glasses sold by a third party cost too much. Now, with EPAZ Stacklens, these organizations will be able to use innovative technology at a low cost, allowing the company to win more deals.

On-site remote-assisted glasses can be used by technicians in the field to fix complex machines, such as HVAC, industrial machines, and water and waste pipes. Additionally, we have seen interest in using the technology for aircraft maintenance. EPAZ plans to continue to improve the technology for use with ZenaDrone 1000, a First-Person View Smart Glasses product with augmented reality technology.

EPAZ has submitted a proposal to the armed forces to use the technology in the field. The company has received feedback from the United States military about using First Person View Smart Glasses with ZenaDrone 1000.

* Negotiating With Non-Dilutive Financer for Drone as a Service Operations for up to 100 Drones; Irish Government Minister Visited ZenaDrone’s Ireland Office

**On May 2nd EPAZ announced that Ossian Smyth, minister of state at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of Ireland, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, visited the EPAZ ZenaDrone offices in Dublin, Irelan. Also, EPAZ is negotiating with a financing institution for a deal to purchase up to 100 ZenaDrone 1000s for drone as-service operations in Ireland.**

The non-dilutive financing terms would receive a purchase order for up to 100 drones. These EPAZ drones will be used in Ireland for establishing drones as a service operation.  ZenaDrone will manage and service these drones for Irish farmers, businesses and government agencies.

Minister Smyth had the opportunity to see a ZenaDrone 1000 and meet EPAZ Irish team to discuss how ZenaDrone can greatly affect the lives of Irish farmers, businesses and government agencies. If ZenaDrone closes on the financing deal, Irish farmers will have access to advanced precision agriculture drones for monitoring plant health and spraying weeds.

* EPAZ ZenaDrone 1000 Displayed at 2023 AERO in Germany Leads to Multiple Demonstrations with NATO Partner Countries Defense and German Law Enforcement and Rail Line

**On April 26th EPAZ announced that the ZenaDrone 1000 was showcased at the AERO General Aviation Convention in Friedrichshafen, Germany, on April 19-22nd. This showcase has led to multiple demonstrations scheduled with NATO partner countries, multiple law enforcement departments, and a large rail line in Germany.**

The EPAZ team at ZenaDrone Germany had a successful debut at Aero, meeting with top organizations to discuss how ZenaDrone 1000 technology can solve their problems with inspections of railways, reducing the use of helicopters and providing critical support to NATO troops. ZenaDrone met with German UAV regulators about setting up beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations in Germany. EPAZ ZenaDrone is already ahead of the game by applying beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations in Ireland, which uses the standards of the European Union via the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. Once EPAZ ZenaDrone receives final approval for beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations in Ireland, ZenaDrone will receive approval in Germany within 10 business days. In the meantime, flight demonstrations will be held in Northern Germany to allow personnel to fly the drone themselves and understand how it fits within their operations.

2023-06-14,Mullen Automotive adds 297 million shares in a day,"Mullen Automotive adds 297 million shares in a day  

On Monday, **Mullen Automotive** announced it had reached a deal with its creditors to amend its Series D Preferred Stock Agreement. Under the new terms, the EV startup would provide its backers with 296.9 million of common stock and pre-funded warrants for a $45 million capital injection. This replaces an agreement that offers Series D Preferred Stock and regular warrants for the money.

Together, this means shareholders face immediate dilution. Once the funding deal is complete, Mullen’s share count will rise from 172.5 million — based on its May 10-Q filing — to approximately 548 million if investors include a separate $20 million deal from last week. That math works out to:

* **172.5 million** shares from its May 12, 2023 10-Q filing
* **19.5 million** shares of common stock for Acuitas Capital (June 5)
* Pre-funded warrants exercisable for **8 million** shares of common stock for Acuitas (June 5)
* Warrants exercisable for **51 million** shares of common stock for Acuitas (June 5)
* **54.7 million** shares of common stock (June 12)
* Pre-funded warrants exercisable for **49.5 million** shares of common stock (June 12)
* Warrants exercisable for **192.7 million** shares of common stock (June 12)

Put another way, Mullen’s shareholders have seen shares outstanding rise 3.2X in less than five weeks.

The firm followed up on Tuesday with a plan to increase its 2022 Equity Incentive Stock Plan by 52 million shares at its August annual meeting. It will also attempt to approve up to a 1-for-10 reverse stock split and move its charter to Maryland to give the board “the power to amend the charter of the corporation, without a stockholder vote, to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares.”

That bodes poorly for those who remain invested in MULN stock. The company only has until September 2023 to regain compliance with the **Nasdaq’s** required minimum $1 bid price, and these significant dilutions (and the potential future ability to create more) suggest the company has little chance of making that happen.

Mullen was always running on borrowed time. And the realities of its “death spiral financing” are finally catching up. 

#  Mullen Stock: Selling $1 Bills for 43 Cents

 Mullen’s June 12 financing deal highlights its reliance on a toxic method of fundraising — the use of convertible instruments to raise cash. I outline here how this form of financing creates a “death spiral” since these dilutive issuances create a negative feedback loop for share prices. 

The EV firm’s most recent deal accelerates this trend. As late as last week, Mullen raised $20 million in exchange for 77.6 million new stock and equivalents. That was 25.8 cents of cash raised for every Mullen share issued.

The latest deal now requires the firm to hand over 296.9 million shares for a $45 million cash injection, a far worse valuation. Mullen’s stock now only generates 15.2 cents per share in this latest deal.

From a cynical perspective, that means Mullen is “selling” $1 bills for 43 cents. Every 15.2 cents of stock and warrants bought by creditors can get immediately turned around for Mullen’s current market value of 35 cents, or a 0.43-to-1 profit ratio. The dilution caused by these issuances will only worsen future funding rounds.

#  When Will Mullen Reverse Split Its Shares?

 Mullen must trade above $1 for at least 10 consecutive days by Sept. 5, 202,3 to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Exchange’s minimum bid price rules. A brief period of above-$1 prices last month has proved insufficient to remove Mullen from the Nasdaq’s list of non-compliant companies.

That means Mullen’s management must reverse-split shares again to avoid a delisting.

In an alternate reality, they would have *already* performed a reverse split. Mullen’s stock currently trades at 35 cents, so dividing shares outstanding by 10 would theoretically send prices to $3.50 — well above the $1 minimum bid price. (Nasdaq rules prohibit cumulative reverse splits of more than 1-for-250 over two years, and Mullen’s recent 1-for-25 split means it can only reverse split another 1-for-10).

But in practice, the company is limited by Delaware’s corporate governance rules. The state typically requires the majority of outstanding shares to approve a reverse split and Mullen’s meme status makes it difficult to reach a quorum. That means Mullen must wait until its annual meeting to approve conversion to a Maryland corporation if it plans to enact a split unilaterally.

By then, it could be too late. The company already faces delisting from the **Russell 3000** and **Russell 2000** indices later this month, and the selling pressure by funds that hold Mullen could send shares to the point where a 1-for-10 reverse split won’t achieve a $1 share price.

Mullen’s lack of meaningful revenue will also add to the concern. Though the firm expects some cash inflow from a 1,000-vehicle deal in August, the funding will likely prove insufficient to balance its budget.

#  What Should Investors Do?

Profit-seeking speculators can still gain through buying puts on the company’s stock. 50-cent puts expiring next month are available for as little as 23 cents, meaning that investors will profit if the stock drops below 27 cents.

Even longer-dated puts have a high chance of paying out. Mullen’s 50-cent puts expiring in October sell for 35 cents, putting their breakeven price at 15 cents. Mullen’s stock could easily hit this level if the firm fails to meet Nasdaq listing rules.

Of course, investors should be wary of betting too much on Mullen’s demise. Its meme potential means even the slightest bit of positive news from its upcoming Randy Marion deliveries this August could send shares skyrocketing. The high implied volatility of Mullen’s shares also means bearish options buyers face exceptionally high theta decay. But if you still hold onto MULN stock, it’s probably best to sell while you still can. According to data from Fintel.io, retail investors have already cut their positions by a third since late May. And you don’t want to be the one holding the bag in any firm going through a financing death spiral.",0.7024295926094055,Positive,English

Since writing a DD for this stock on Reddit, it has nearly tripled**.** Volume has increased heavily since**.** Here is why I am EVEN MORE bullish now:

*Original DD 2 months ago:* “[https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/12awmzw/verses\_ai\_has\_great\_catalysts\_that\_can\_help\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/12awmzw/verses_ai_has_great_catalysts_that_can_help_it/)”

**TLDR/ Investment Thesis:**

VERSES AI is a cognitive computing company that is developing a new type of AI that is designed to mimic human understanding. Verses AI is called GIA, has developed an advanced AI platform called KOSM which powers it. KOSM can connect data, rules, simulations, and processes to help businesses make better decisions. It also has a broad range of applications in industries such as smart cities, smart grids, and smart homes, to name a few. 

Contrary to existing Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s BARD, and Meta’s LLAMA, which generate content based on inferred patterns but lack deep comprehension, VERSES is striving for a more human-like understanding. They aim for their AI not merely to mimic but to truly understand, incorporating new information post-training and applying nuance, similar to a human brain.

Today (6/5), the largest law firm in the world, Dentons, has co-authored a 50-page whitepaper with VERSES on how to govern AI, titled “A Path to Global AI Governance”. The report by VERSES and Dentons is a valuable contribution to the debate about the governance of AI, as it is a set of protocols, believed to become the backbone of AI governance. The report’s recommendations are comprehensive and well-argued, and they offer a roadmap for how to ensure that AI is used safely and responsibly.

Verses AI has a strong team of experienced AI professionals, and it has raised over $20 million in funding (this funding will help the company to grow its business and develop its AI platform). The company is already working with Fortune 500 companies, and it has the potential to be a major player in the AI industry.

VERSES’s leadership and technology AI team is led by Dr. Karl Friston (Dr. Karl Friston is a prominent British neuroscientist and theoretical neurobiologist, widely recognized for his work on brain imaging, neural networks, and computational models of brain function) and others who have a lot of experience in AI, IoT, Robotics, VR/AR, Enterprise Software, and Global Sales.

If GIA is successful, it could revolutionize the field of AI. Here are some of the benefits of VERSES’s AI:

* It could be more accurate and less biased than current AI models.
* It could be able to learn and adapt more easily.
* It could be able to interact with the physical world in a more natural way.

Looking at the AI industry’s prospective growth, it’s slated to become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030, with a CAGR of over 40%. The AI market is growing rapidly. The global AI market is expected to reach $422.37 billion by 2028.

VERSES offers an AI ecosystem for a variety of global solutions to B2B, B2G and B2C businesses in across all major industries. Their business model includes various revenue streams such as licensing, Joint Ventures, KOSM fees, compute fees, transaction fees, and marketplace fees.

Verses AI’s focus on diversifying revenue streams and strategic collaborations offers a strong and sustainable business model. The AI industry’s exponential growth, plus Verses AI’s strong foundation and partnerships are very attractive.

VERSES’s AI could have a major impact on a variety of industries, including:

* Manufacturing: GIA could be used to automate tasks, improve quality control, and reduce costs.
* Logistics: GIA could be used to optimize transportation routes, track inventory, and manage supply chains.
* Healthcare: GIA could be used to diagnose diseases, provide personalized care, and develop new treatments.
* Education: GIA could be used to personalize learning, provide feedback, and create engaging educational experiences.

VRSSF has good upside potential, a strong business model with multiple revenue streams, significant revenue potential, near-term growth catalysts, a strong cash position as well and has intentions to uplist onto NASDAQ

Verses AI is up while C3.ai $AI is down. The trading volume of VRSSF has increased a lot. The average volume stands at 369,753, but the most recent volume was nearly three times that at 1,092,582. This increased activity shows heightened investor interest and could signify a positive momentum shift.

 Overall, the technical analysis data for Verses AI is positive. The stock is trading above its moving averages, the RSI is above 50 and rising, and volume is increasing. These are all bullish signs that suggest that the stock could continue to rise in the future.

&#x200B;

* **Earnings**: Earnings per share (EPS) has been negative in recent quarters, but it is trending upwards. This shows that the company is on the path to profitability.
* One critical takeaway from the financials is the company’s ability to control its operating expenses, which dropped significantly from $16.91 million to $4.27 million. This is a strong indication that management is focused on efficiency and cost control, which is an excellent sign for future profitability.
* Many young companies, especially in technology, often operate at a loss in their early years as they invest heavily in research, development, and market penetration. The fact that VRSSF has seen such rapid sales growth and improvement in gross income suggests they are on a great path.
* **Cash flow**: Cash flow from operations has been positive in recent quarters, which means that the company is generating enough cash to cover its operating expenses.
* **Debt**: Debt is relatively low, which means that the company does not have a lot of financial obligations.

&#x200B;

This increased activity shows heightened investor interest and could signify a positive momentum shift.

* **Moving averages:** The 50-day moving average is rising, which is a bullish sign. The 200-day moving average is also rising, which is a sign of a long-term uptrend.

* **Bollinger bands:** The Bollinger bands are widening, which is a sign of increasing volatility. However, the bands are still relatively narrow, which is a sign of a healthy market.
* **Volume:** Volume is increasing, which is a bullish sign. Increasing volume shows that more people are buying the stock, which is a sign of increasing demand.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** Overall, Verses AI is a company with a lot of potential. It has a strong team, a solid financial foundation, and a number of innovative products and services. Verses AI can revolutionize the field of AI by being more accurate and less biased than current models while being able to learn and adapt more easily. I believe that Verses AI has the potential to be a major player in the AI industry, and I am bullish on the company.

2023-03-14,MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital Lead Bounce for Crypto-Related Stocks,"MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital Lead Bounce for Crypto-Related Stocks The government's weekend backstop of depositors at failed lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank sent bitcoin above $22,000.

Crypto-related stocks are mostly posting modest gains alongside the price of bitcoin (BTC) in premarket action on Monday following government moves on Sunday to stem what was shaping up to be a banking crisis.

The price of bitcoin had plunged to below $20,000 late last week following the failures of crypto-focused Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, a bank with many ties to the crypto industry. Silvergate was a relatively small lender, but the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank – the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history – had many going into the weekend worried about systemic contagion.

A number of government agencies Sunday evening teamed up to protect all depositors at Silicon Valley Bank. At the same time, New York regulators shut down Signature Bank (SBNY) as the federal government promised to protect all depositors. The actions sent U.S. stock index futures higher by more than 1%, though that rally lost steam shortly before the open. At press time, only Nasdaq 100 futures remain in the green, up 0.2%.

On Sunday, bitcoin bounced as high as $22,600. It was recently trading at $22,100. Among crypto-related stock movers Monday morning, MicroStrategy (MSTR), a software company that holds a large amount of bitcoin, rose 5.6%, and bitcoin miners Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) were up 5.5% and 2.6%, respectively.

While things have settled down a bit, there are still plenty of potential catalysts ahead this week. Many of those events center around central banker speaking engagements.

 The fact remains that news can act as a direct catalyst no matter what the price of a stock is. This article looks at a handful of companies that have reported new updates and milestones that ignited interest in the stock market this week. We look into what’s going on, and what the updates are and see if any future events may be worth noting in the near term that may be of interest. 

 

**Penny Stocks To Watch**

## Creative Medical Technology Holdings Inc. (CELZ)

[Biotechnology penny stocks](https://pennystocks.com/category/penny-stock-sectors/biotech-stocks/) have gotten plenty of attention in the stock market over the last few weeks. Since the beginning of the year, low-priced, highly speculative companies have been gaining momentum. Creative Medical Technology is the latest to hit the radar after releasing its latest update. Creative focuses on regenerative therapeutic platforms, including immunotherapy, urology, orthopedics, neurology, and endocrinology.

 

### CELZ Stock News

This week CELZ stock spiked after announcing receipt of approval from the Institutional Review Board to move forward with its Clinical Trial for treating Type 1 Diabetes with its CELZ-201.

“The purpose of IRB review and approval is to assure that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of patients participating as subjects in the research and is an important milestone in proceeding with a clinical trial. We are pleased with achieving IRB approval expeditiously and look forward to moving forward with our Phase 1/2 clinical trial,” said CEO Timothy

 

## Zhongchao Inc. (ZCMD)

Tech stocks have also gotten some renewed interest thanks to a surge of attention on artificial intelligence and things like ChatGPT. Zhongchao offers services to oncology patients. This year has been an active one for the company after reaching several significant milestones, including introducing anti-influenza drugs in China and launching medication management platforms to facilitate cancer treatment. However, this week’s update seems to have struck a chord with the market more than previous announcements have.

 

### ZCMD Stock News

This week, Zhongchao announced the application of ChatGPT to enhance patient management service offerings and patient experiences. Weiguang Yang, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Zhongchao, commented, “We believe that the Company’s application of ChatGPT to patient education and management will greatly enhance patient service experience and open up new avenues for growth in the patient-related business. Moving forward, we will continue to explore the full potential of ChatGPT and evaluate other emerging technologies to providing advanced solutions to enhance patient experience.”

 

## Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT)

Earlier this week, the company also announced the launch of a new subsidiary. The new business aims to deliver products for government and defense sector clients, which has played a role in the stock market today.

 

### QUBT Stock News

This week Quantum announced a subcontract award supporting NASA to test quantum sensing solutions to monitor climate change. Sean Gabeler, President of QiSolutions, said, “This is a major step for QCI in demonstrating the application of its technology. QiSolutions was established specifically for this type of effort, and we are ready to execute to ensure success for this project.”

 

## GeoVax Inc. (GOVX)

Since the start of 2023, GeoVax has steadily climbed higher thanks to a mix of retail speculation and company updates. Its focus has been developing immunotherapies and vaccines to fight cancers and infectious diseases. Believe it or not, one of the most significant catalysts this quarter was related to a Zika vaccine patent. While COVID and RSV seem to have captivated headlines, the Zika patent news sparked a strong bullish signal to the market. But that isn’t why GOVX is in the spotlight right now.

 

### GOVX Stock News

This week, GeoVax made several updates, including expanding its Gedeptin clinical research in advanced head and neck cancers. Its phase 1/2 trial is now active at Stanford, Emory, and Thomas Jefferson Universities.

## NeuroSense (NRSN)

Shares of NeuroSense have been in the spotlight for the last few weeks. Much of the focus came after the company reported final data on its Alzheimer’s biomarker study. Initial results from the study demonstrated that Alzheimer’s patients showed higher levels of specific proteins (TDP-43) and validated earlier finding, with the biomarker being found in 57% of patients. While shares of NRSN stock have dipped since the news came out, the market has maintained some attention on the company, and recent news reignited bullishness in the stock market today.

 

### NRSN Stock News

It is considered to be number one stock in total asset category among related companies fabricating about  12,173,661  of Total Asset per Shares Owned by Institutions. . Comparative valuation analysis is a catch-all model that can be used if you cannot value OLB by discounting back its dividends or cash flows. This model doesn't attempt to find an intrinsic value for OLB's Stock . Still, instead, it compares the stock's price multiples to a benchmark or nearest competition to determine if the stock is relatively undervalued or overvalued. The reason why the comparable model can be used in almost all circumstances is due to the vast number of multiples that can be utilized, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-book (P/B), price-to-sales (P/S), price-to-cash flow (P/CF), and many others. The P/E ratio is the most commonly used of these ratios because it focuses on the OLB's earnings, one of the primary drivers of an investment's value.",0.0,Neutral,English

 **2.Boxlight Corp. (BOXL)** Shares of Boxlight Corp. have finished out their trading days green more times than red. The latest string of bullishness in education technology stocks. If you recall, in several articles, we discussed companies like Genius Group GNS, which hit the ground running at the end of January. Not only has Genius news focused on companies “fighting against illegal trading activity,” it may have also rubbed off on some of the EdTech stocks in the market recently.

With earnings season heating up, BOXL stock could be on the radar to see if it continued growing while also meeting analyst expectations. Despite the third quarter being the “strongest to date,” according to CEO Michael Pope, the numbers missed sales expectations. Boxlight expects Q4 revenue to come in at $48 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Full-year revenue is pegged at $227 million with an adjusted EBITDA of $18 million.

**3. Troika Media (TRKA)** 

Troika Media has been one of the cheap penny stocks to watch this year. TRKA stock started the year trading around 11 cents. Since then, it has climbed as high as $0.21. The most significant focus for traders right now is on Troika’s situation with Blue Torch Finance.

Last month, the two companies entered a further limited waiver of certain events of default under an original March 2022 finance agreement. There are currently “good faith” negotiations between the companies to amend the deal and mitigate events of default. According to the amended filing, the Limited Waiver expires this month if it isn’t terminated sooner by Blue Torch.

**4. Iveda Solutions Inc. (IVDA)**  

Even though technology stocks, in general, have faced an uphill battle recently, that doesn’t mean all of tech should be ignored in the short term. Iveda Solutions stock has bounced back from recent lows with increasing volume this week. The AI video and sensor tech company continues trading higher weeks after its recently $1.5 million project.

I was introduced to it by a coworker who found a ""company"" that basically sells trading signals for 10% of your profit on a trade.  My coworker put several thousand dollars via a [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) account into a sketchy looking broker who claims to be a partner of IC Markets.  This website was registered less than a year ago, has a phone number which isn't connected, and a support email to a domain that isn't registered.  My coworker is super freaked out now that I have showed this to him.

In his sketchy (probably fake) broker account he as supposedly makes 20K + in one month trading, and has been at this for a few months now.  From there he moves some profits back to his crypto account to pay the trading signal supplier - which is several thousand dollars.  He also said he took some profits to cover his initial investment, so if the whole thing is a scam, he isn't out any real money.

I'm just trying to figure out what the scam is here.  Are these profits he is making real money that can be moved into actual fiat somehow?  Is this a market mover using 1,000 guys like my coworker to manipulate markets?  Perhaps this is money laundering scheme?  Is my coworker going to prison for some kinda super sketchy illegal financial fraud?  Do they have some kinda access to his crypto account and can drain it one day?  Maybe this is some cartel shit?

Currency Strength - I check for real-time currency strength on Marketmilk.com for day trading or TradingEconomic.com(For performing my Fundamental analysis) for swing trading. I focus on the weakest versus strongest currencies pairs. I also check news channels for any geopolitical event(Not necessary!)

Time Frame Analysis - I identify the High Time Frame trend using the 200/50 Moving Average (EMA) cross. I also confirm sentiment misalignment on fxbook/sentiment.com and I mainly use the 1-hour, 5-minute, and 1-second timeframes for analysis :)

Detailed Examination - I just scale down to the 5-minute timeframe for a closer look, no biggie

Trend Alignment - I wait for an alignment of the Low Time Frame trend with the High Time Frame trend.

Execution - Enter trades on the first stage wave Buy/Sell signal on the Low Time Frame trend means I find entries as soon as the trend starts.

Profit Targets - Just set my profit targets at High Time Frame support and resistance levels but my default R-R is 1-3.

High impact News - Check for high-impact news and bank holidays.

Trading Sessions - Trade only during New York/London sessions for tighter spreads but other session have wider spreads 10-12 GMT

Order Splitting - I split my entry into two orders for two take profits, with a minimum and maximum of 3-6. Set a break-even for the latter. Risk at 0.5% per order but I sometimes use 2%, it depends.

2023-07-29,Swap Fee/Rate and Spreads?,"Swap Fee/Rate and Spreads? Hello,

I’m from UK and my broker is Pepperstone also based in the UK I believe and I deposited £gbp sterling pounds capital into my brokerage account.

I use MT4 phone app to mostly swing trade. On my open positions/closed trades I see the word ‘Swap’ with the - or no symbol before that word.

Does - in front of Swap means I’m liable to pay the overnight swap fees rate and if so when do I pay the swap, is it when I close exit my position trade or is it automatically deducted daily from my liquid balance at my broker when the position is still open no matter how long the position is open for?

Lastly which trading quote pairs that pepperstone offers, whether its indices, forex, commodities or whatever has the most lowest spreads and also they pay me the swap rate fee, not that I pay them the swap fees for swing trading?

What determines whether I pay the swap fee or they pay me the swap fee? And does this matter whether I go long or short?

Lastly when it comes to spreads, yesterday I opened a market order trade on the orange juice commodity market that had a spread of 174 and I can straight away see my position at a loss in the red of -174, then a minute later the spread dropped to 34 so my loss is reduced to -34 then I see spread went up to 174 range again and my loss increased. Question, is the spread trading fee fixed when I enter open the trade at whatever the spread was at the time or am I liable to variable spreads during how long I keep my position trade open? Does limit/stop orders have cheaper spreads than market orders?

Finally does increase lots sizes multiplies spread fees and swap fees?

Just thinking is it possible to blow up an account on swing trades just from spread and swap fees alone eating away at your liquid capital balance on a lets say for example plenty of lots open on a non-volatile market?

A little context: I am a programmer (got laid off last year) and then I decided to get into forex full-time. I blew several demo accounts while learning and then when I started to get a whiff of profitability some weeks ago I threw in my last $100 which was obliterated by some bugs in my own EA. 

I'm basically using a trend following strategy, which closes positions on overbought/oversold levels. However my EA would instead close a position and then immediately open another, since the trend is not over, and then close it immediately, since OS/OB levels are still on. Thus my account ended at around $2 before I was margin called.

I don't know what to do. My plan was to grow the account in order to afford a prop firm challenge, I am currently unemployed and this being a third world country jobs aren't easy to get. Not to mention the rising political tensions which could see the local currency deteriorate. 

However I have painfully learnt to backtest often, and now I've got a much improved EA using a modification of the strategy.

I am awfully confused at how I trade to make profit. As observed in the picture above, I sold at the arrow and cashed out there expecting to make profit, yet I made a loss because I actually sold at a different price to what I was observing on the candles.

2023-04-21,Daily Accountability - Day 5 - 21.04.23,"Daily Accountability - Day 5 - 21.04.23 Hi All,

Brief but positive update today. Finished 2% up today, but a bit of a weird one. As I said in the previous post I was quite busy today so took one trade on EURGBP. As I was busy I took the trade on my phone and accidentally put the SL to close, so traded a higher lot size than usual. Fortunately, the trade worked out. 

I am still going to be switching to only the EURUSD from next week as I think that will definitely improve my consistency. Today backs that up even further, I took the least trades today but made the most profit. 

So, from Monday I will only trade EURUSD and give my full attention to that and see how it goes. It may be frustrating at first because I will know that there are other moves I could get in on, on other pairs, but I will overcome that. Simply put, trading so many pairs just makes it so that when I do win, I cant make up for the losses, and I miss out on many good moves cause my attention is split. Hopefully trading one pair fixes this. I have a few other ideas that I could implement to improve the strategy, but I will implement those if the results on EURUSD aren't positive.

Maybe I will do a post over the weekend, or maybe not.

Happy trading all!",0.916240394115448,Positive,English

Again finished the day in the red, around -3% today unfortunately.

A couple trades went against me quickly which meant SL want trailed closer so took a full loss of 1%.  First trade of the day was a nice 1% profit which took the account back to breakeven, maybe could’ve stopped trading there, but other opportunities came up.

In hindsight, maybe I was taking trades just to get back losses, they all fit my criteria though, but it is something I will keep an eye on. Hopefully tomorrow is a green day!",-0.7807071208953857,Negative,English

Fundamental:

\-  The pair is stuck in a range while the banking crisis was unfolding in the US and Europe over the past 2-3 weeks.  **There was a big drop in AUDUSD on March 7, but that was before the worst of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) unfolded.**  

\-  **Central banks and Government authorities reacted quickly and managed the SVB and Credit Suisse collapses** without allowing contagion to spread to other troubled banks so far.  

\-  Nonetheless, the situation remains fragile. Whenever a bank fails, markets remain on edge. This sense of cautiousness will linger among traders and investors. 

\-> Consequently, **any further worsening of the situation for banks, could quickly develop in a larger risk aversion sell-off. Currencies like the Aussie will be vulnerable in such a situation. Hence a bearish break in AUDUSD would be the likely outcome.** 

&#x200B;

Technical:

\-  The top side of the flag pattern is currently located **between the 100-day (orange) and 200-day (red) moving average at the 0.6750 - 0.6800 zone.** 

\-  T**he bear flag pattern will only be triggered on a breakout below the lower line**, currently located around 0.6630.  **A daily close below this zone would send the breakout signal.** 

\-  **AUDUSD is then likely to continue the downtrend, and we can use the 0.65, 0.64, and 0.63 zones as TP targets on short trades.**

Fundamentals:

\-  **The Silicon Valley Bank failure in the US and today’s troubles of Credit Suisse in the Eurozone have investors cut their bets for more rate hikes from either the ECB or the Fed.**

\-  T**he euro is in central focus with that ECB meeting tomorrow. Volatility is guaranteed, with the current situation around Credit Suisse** making their decision that much more difficult.

\-  **With Swiss bank Credit Suisse’s troubles mounting and its stock price plunging by 30% today, expectations for ECB rate hikes have shrunk accordingly.**

\-  **If the ECB caves in under pressure and hikes only by 25bp (or doesn't hike at all), this will be bearish news for the euro currency, and EURUSD will likely drop below 1.0550.**

&#x200B;

Technical:

\-  **Today’s sharp drop quickly took EURUSD to this 1.0550 neckline support, and only a small further push lower is needed for a break to be confirmed.**

\-  The neckline connects and is located right in this area also coincides with the **100-day moving average (orange line).** **A technical break below this zone, with a completed daily close below the neckline and 100 DMA, would be a huge bearish signal for EURUSD.**

\-  **This 1.0500 - 1.0550 zone that is now being tested is likely the key to this bullish/bearish sentiment turning point. A bearish break here should lead to the capitulation of many EURUSD bulls.**

&#x200B;

Trade plan:

Entry:

* **Wait for a bearish break of the neckline;**
* **Look for a short entry once the trigger signal is completed** 

**Stop:**

* **Place decently above the neckline;**
* **The stop can be placed at least above 1.06 - 1.0650, and even above 1.07 would be a very reasonable location to place the stop**

**TP:**

* **1st - 1.03 - moderate support zone (take some profits here)**
* **2nd - 1.00 - main target, this is the head projection of the H&S pattern**

2023-12-31,"Year 4 of Spreadsheets and Sankeys (70% savings rate, graphs, reflections)","Year 4 of Spreadsheets and Sankeys (70% savings rate, graphs, reflections) Happy new year, everyone! I'm a big fan of tracking my finances and enabling others to do the same, and a few years ago I created a [FIRE spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/rwq9qw/i_made_a_new_and_improved_advanced/) for our community. Alongside my spreadsheet, I also track my finances using annual Sankey diagrams, which depict the flow of my income, expenses, and savings. I've made one for myself each year for the last four years. I'd like to share this resource with the community in case you're looking for fun new ways to track your finances, and I'd also like to share my progress year-over-year towards FIRE, visualized with Sankeymatic:

and for fun, [here's my end of year 2023 spreadsheet dashboard update](https://i.imgur.com/fpLwDCc.png).

# Summary 2023:

* Income: I work in technology consulting. My salary was $150.7k and my bonus was $5k. I also made $7k off of credit card churning by using points to cover travel expenses.
* Expenses: My expenses totaled \~$42.5k, with \~$35k paid out of pocket, net of work reimbursements and credit card points. My biggest expenses were rent (\~$14k), travel (\~$10k), restaurants (\~$4k), personal training (\~$3k), and groceries (\~$2k). I mostly work from home, don't own a car, have no children, have no debt, and rent an apartment with my partner in a MCOL city. Our finances are separate. We split rent and I cover the rest of our joint expenses. I track taxes separate of expenses, which totaled about $39k.
* Savings: As I do every year since 2020, I maxed my 401(k), IRA, and HSA. My taxable brokerage contributions this year were almost as much as I was making gross in 2020.
* Room for error: My Sankey was off by $224 this year, reflected in ""Misc Income."" With over $186k to track, I'm very pleased with how close I was this year thanks to meticulous spreadsheet tracking. I record my income/savings monthly and my expenses daily using a Google Form bookmarked on my phone. Overall, I spend <30min/mo in my spreadsheet.

# Observations YoY:

* I made less money: my 2022 salary + bonus was $144k + $17k = $161k. This year I made $155.7k. In total, I made \~$5k less than last year. The technology consulting industry has been going through a lot of layoffs. The decrease was expected, but even so I'm aiming for a new job in 2024. My goal is to get a promotion and $190k total compensation.
* I spent more money: my expenses increased by \~$5k out of pocket, with the biggest increases in spend attributed to a personal trainer ($660/mo), a housecleaner ($110 every 2 weeks), and travel. I don't regret any of those purchases and expect them to continue in 2024.
* I pulled from savings: by the end of 2022, I had $30k in savings. I feel comfortable with $10-15k as an emergency fund, so I decided to rebalance the majority of this into my taxable brokerage account.
* I saved less: My savings in the 2023 Sankey reflected +$10k from 2022, but $20k was pulled from my HYSA this year, so my overall savings is down by $10k YoY, as a result of -$5k income and +$5k expenses. My savings rate calculation is: (all savings and investments, pre- or post-tax + employer contribution) / (gross income - taxes + employer contribution). This encompasses everything you save over everything it is possible for you to save. My savings rate this year was 70%. Last year's was 74%. I'd be able to hit 75% next year if I can keep my spend around the same ($35k) and increase my gross income by \~$30k.
* My net worth increased by \~$155k: You'll have to check my spreadsheet for this one. My EOY net worth in 2022 was $256k. I'm ending 2023 at $411k. I'm really feeling the power of compounding gains and am so thankful I found this community very early in my career. Thanks, everyone, for the motivation and education.

2023-12-31,80% Savings Rate in HCOL -- Spending Breakdown,"80% Savings Rate in HCOL -- Spending Breakdown Technically 79.4%, but I'm giving myself the win.

**TLDR**; 26M. Make a lot, spend a little, ensure the ways you're spending a little align with your desires and values. See Sankey diagram below for where my money comes from and goes. Want to spend more in 2024 on vacations and entertainment, but also expect income to increase significantly so savings rate should stay flat or even increase.

[2023 Sankey](https://imgur.com/a/UwCJHYV) (I think numbers make it too crowded, top-level numbers can be found throughout the post)

Happy New Years everyone! Assuming everyone else enjoys seeing spending breakdowns as much as I do, I thought I would share my 2023 spending and give some details on how I saved 80% of my take-home pay in a HCOL (COL index of 140-150) and some changes I expect to make in 2024.

**Savings Rate**

First to get the savings rate debate out of the way, I calculate as 1- \[expenses / {take home pay + 401k + HSA + 401k match}\]. If you're looking at my 2023 Sankey it's (Savings/\[Savings+Expenses\]) or in plain English ""how much of the money that enters my accounts I keep"".

**Income**

Gross income was $145K for the year, putting me in the [97th percentile in the US for my age](https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-by-age-calculator/). I have worked hard to get to this point, though I am fully aware that I would be in a much different spot without two critical lucky breaks.

Other income for the year is negligible but includes a WFH stipend and dog sitting.

Income could have been higher this year but as some of you may recall [I was furloughed early this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/11a5m4q/furloughed_job_hop_or_travel_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Furlough was supposed to last four months, I was offered my job back after 10 days. I was very seriously considering deferring the offer to take the 'round the world trip all of you were supporting, but it was clear to me that I wanted to return to my job. There will be other times for globetrotting. Ended up getting promoted 3 months later so it's worked out.

I recognize that an 80% savings rate doesn't happen without outsized income. There is only so much you can cut.

**Expenses**

Expenses totaled $24,250 in 2023. Nearly 50% of this was housing (rent, utilities, and internet) and another 20% was food (groceries, restaurants, and alcohol & bars). Misc. is nearly all phone bill and gifts, just wanted to limit categories.

Housing costs are reduced by splitting a 3bd between 4 people (and are even inflated this year as I paid double rent for a month when I moved). I clip coupons shopping for groceries (electronically, takes 5 minutes before heading out to save 15-40%), shop deals, and cook 90% of my own meals. I rarely drink alcohol (health reasons) and very rarely do it at a bar, most of my alcohol spending is buying way more than I'll drink to bring to a friend's house party. Most of my entertainment is free through the library and public parks.

Debt repayment is a combination of private and federal student loans. Private loans make up 95%+ of that expense and will be done 12/2024 so that is a short term ""savings"" bucket that I recognize could be categorized as an expense if somebody chose to organize their budget differently.

One glaring difference from a typical budget is likely my transportation costs. Since I work from home I do not own a car and am able to get where I need to go 90% of the time on foot or on bike. Another 9% of the time public transit can get me there. The final 1% I'll borrow a roommate's car and fill up the tank (can think of 4 times this year that I borrowed a car).

**Reflections**

Saving 80%+ is a lot. Helps to make above average income. Then have below average spending. The key to doing this to a relatively extreme level of 80% AND being happy is that a lot of the reduced spending ""decisions"" actually align incredibly well with my values and what I would be choosing to do regardless of the money.

I live with 3 of my best friends. I love to bike and walk. There are environmental reasons to go without a car if I can. Very little non-food shopping also aligns with my environmental and sustainability initiatives. My inexpensive entertainment is truly all I need with lots of camping, hiking, playing sports in public parks, using my public library. There are many things that I would never choose to change about my current lifestyle and circumstances regardless of the money.

In reality though if I were making minimum wage in my area the above would just be called *surviving* and I'd have 1-2K saved at the end of the year to show for it, so I don't think I'm really doing anything that radical. I just happen to make a good amount of money and don't spend like it.

**Changes for 2024**

There are some changes in both income and expenses coming in 2024.

Budget line items I would like to increase are Vacation and Entertainment. I want to visit more new places with amazing people this year and there are concerts and other experiences that I can take greater advantage of with friends. Trying to focus on embracing doing more with the people I love this year and not giving a second thought to the financial aspect of it.

Budget line items that I may be forced to increase are Housing and Transportation. Current lease is up this summer and I don't know what my next move will be, so that could certainly have a substantial impact on the year's expenses, though I'll do my best to keep it approximately the same. Transportation may 20x if I decide to buy a car for the convenience. High cost for few use cases (though I imagine I'll use it more if it's there), but it would be nice to have when I need it and a $10-15K vehicle really won't change my financial picture.

Income will be increasing significantly this year to $250K gross with a job change, so even with increased spending I'll very likely increase my savings rate in 2024. Make that 3 critical lucky breaks so far.

Really appreciate having these communities to interact with and learn from, hope everybody has an incredible 2024!

Edit since apparently my dating life is an important topic of discussion: I will not go into detail but have happily been with a partner for several years. Thanks to all those who were concerned. ",0.6104537844657898,Positive,English
2023-12-30,Reflecting on 25 Year FI Journey -- $0 to $4.6 Million,"Reflecting on 25 Year FI Journey -- $0 to $4.6 Million I made some graphs showing my net worth and asset changes during the \~25 years I have been working.  My gross employer earnings were slightly above $100k during the vast majority of this period.  The graphs are inflation adjusted, and expressed in constant 2023 $.  For a graph to increase, the asset value needs to increase faster than inflation.  Links are below.

* **Linear** \-- [https://imgur.com/SP6E3g0](https://imgur.com/SP6E3g0)
* **Logarithmic** \-- [https://imgur.com/78bydI9](https://imgur.com/78bydI9)

The dashed black line shows the curve formed by the equation $43,500 \* 1.43\^year, which explains 99% of variance in my net worth (r\^2 = 0.99).   For example:

* **Year 10** \-- Equation predicts net worth of $43,500 \* 10\^1.43 = $1.2M, Actual was $1.2M
* **Year 20** \-- Equation predicts net worth of $43,500 \* 20\^1.43 = $3.2M, Actual was $3.3M
* **Current** \-- Equation predicts net worth of $43,500 \* 25.5\^1.43 = $4.5M, Actual was $4.6M

The other curves show assets that are sub-components of net worth.   A brief summary is below:

* **Black  = Net worth**;  Peak inflation adjusted value occurred in early 2022
* **Red = Primary home**;  Peak inflation adjusted value occurred in early 2022
* **Blue = Investments**; Peak inflation adjusted value occurred near start of 2022 for retirement and occurred this week for brokerage (had a lot of after tax investments this year).
* **Green = Short Term**;  I keep short-term in whatever gets me the highest return, which can include non-traditional investments.  My short term is currently mostly in bank bonuses.  When between bank bonuses, I've been putting it mostly in t-bills.  I averaged a \~8% effective APY in 2023.

The curves are by no means smooth and steady lines. Instead they show a lot of deviations and in some cases sharp changes.   A brief summary of some periods are below:

* **Year 0-1:  Motivated to Pursue FIRE** \-- After graduating college, I was hoping to be retired before age 40 and enthusiastic about investing to pursue this goal, rather than enthusiastic about working.   By year 1, 93% of my net worth was in stocks, with a heavy weight on tech stocks, including via ESPP.   (Year 1 NW = $65k)
* **Year 2-4:  Dot Com Crash** \--  The company I was working for liquidated, making employer stocks worthless.  After being disappointed with losing returns year after year and losing such a large portion of my investments, I stopped investing in after tax brokerage (still maxed out 401k) and instead turned to real estate.  Note that net worth is well below equation expectations by year 4. (Year 4 NW = $200k)
* **Year 4-9:  2000s Housing Bubble** \-- I bought a condo in year 4.  It was about the cheapest non-mobile home available in my HCOL area, which was all I could afford at the time. Value shot up rapidly during the housing bubble (red line).   By year 8-9, 60% of net worth was in home.  By year 9, net worth was well above equation expectations. (Year 9 NW = $1.25M)
* **Year 10-11: Great Recession, Housing Bubble Bursts** \--  When the housing bubble burst, my home lost \~40% of its value.   My investments lost a little over half their value dropping from a peak of $280k to a min of $140k.  I also unknowingly sold the index funds I had purchased in early years, when the brokerage liquidated funds and stopped offering the funds.  I didn't become aware that they had been effectively sold at bottom of crash until years later.     I had significant side income during this period, and made some gains purchasing a home at the newly discounted prices (see below).  Nevertheless, my net worth dropped significantly, moving to well below equation expectations again. (Year 11 NW = $1.15M)
* **Year 11 -- Bought Home** \-- With housing prices back to the historical trend line, lots of good deals with the countless short sales and foreclosures in my area, I thought this would be a good time to buy a home that truly met my needs and desires well.  My earlier cheap condo did not.  I live in a VHCOL area, so I needed to accumulate a good amount of cash (green line) and take a 401k loan to afford the home I wanted to buy.   We closed on the last day before a short-sale became a foreclosure, which contributed to getting an exceptional deal on the home.  The previous owner owed several hundred thousand more than value of his mortgage.  After year 11, 80% of my net worth was in my primary home.  I still live in the home today. It truly has improved my life and meets my needs well.
* **Year 12-21 -- Decade of Prosperity** \-- Both real estate and stock investments were increasing in value well.   I finally got over my cold feet about non-retirement investing in year 15 and started investing in an after-tax brokerage again, which relates to why the green short-term line levels off.   Brokerage investment (purple dashed line) increased by factor of 10 from $34k to $350k.   Retirement investment increased from $220k to $800k.  Home value increased from $1.1M to $1.7M   My net worth follows the trend line well during this period. (Year 21 NW = $3.4M)
* **Year 22-Present -- COVID Instability** \-- Home value increased by 50% to $2.5M in a span of 2 years, then had a sharp drop, then had a sharp increase again.  Home unaffordability is at record levels, which would normal push prices down, but few want to sell and lose their 2-3% mortgage, which seemingly is keeping prices from dropping off.    Investments increased by 75% to $1.7M over a span of \~2 years.  The market dropped shortly after COVID, than had a rapid increase to start of 22 when peak inflation adjusted market indexes occurred, then had a sharp drop in 2022, then had a sharp increase in 2023. (Current NW = $4.6M)

I mentioned that when I was in college, I had hoped to retire before 40.  I believe I have reached financial independence now and could stop working.  However, I choose not to at this time.  My employer salary progression has only slightly surpassed inflation since I started working, which largely relates to not job hopping or focusing on increasing salary.  Instead I've focused more on making work a more pleasant experience for me, which I have had some success at.  I currently work fully from home in a flexible hours, low stress job that I usually enjoy; so I am not in a big rush to quit.   If this changes or I develop a big passion that requires a large portion of my time, then I may choose to retire.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-12-28,2 Year Update - Boring Middle Commences,"2 Year Update - Boring Middle Commences *\[ VHCOL, Tech, 28M \]*

So it is around the 2 year mark of learning about FIRE. I haven't really posted a 1 year update, but I guess I will start just for archival purposes and maybe it might be good content for the sub/anyone getting inspo.

**The Story**

I live in a VHCOL city and did a tech bootcamp to switch careers in 2021. I was mostly inspired because my new girlfriend at the time was a data scientist and made more than twice I did, and she was low key a coach and was super supportive. I came to it naturally and got an awesome job, admittedly at an incredibly opportune time at the end of the 2021 bull run. I was not laid off, and currently accruing experience!

**The Numbers**

|Year|Total Comp|Net Worth|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2021|$45k|$40k|
|2022|$150k|$75k|

   * These break down some of my most popular spending categories but it is not comprehensive. I left out smaller ticket categories.

   * Taxable - $65k
   * Emergency Fund (HYSA) - $24k
   * Checkings - $8k
   * Roth - $7k
   * Crypto - $7k

**Strategy**

I am basically trying to save half of my income. This year, I was around 40%. I am able to do this by several key strategies:

1. Living modestly. I share a 500 square foot apartment with my girlfriend. A little snug but it works for us, and we pay a ton less than median for our neighborhood. I also don't own a car, public transportation works great where I live.
2. Pretax helps lower tax burden. 401k + Roth IRA. I learned about HSAs this year, so I signed up for that during open enrollment.
3. I know that my net worth jump is crazy this year, a $115k difference while only saving \~$67k. This year my investments nearly doubled in value because I took a pretty aggressive approach with leveraged ETFs, mega-cap tech stocks, and crypto. I generally try to follow the Bogle idea but while I'm young I think it is still okay to take some calculated risk.
4. Similarly, my 401k grew so much so fast because I am utilizing the Mega backdoor Roth 401k strategy. Not entirely but a bit.
5. I dabbled with some churning on credit card rewards, gambling sites that matched deposits and hedged to guarantee returns, etc. Got about $2.5k from that, which was nice but not game-changing. Idk if it was really worth the effort
6. I haven't spent $7k because I will use it to fund my backdoor Roth IRA in January.

2023-12-26,Fire in Uzbekistan,"Fire in Uzbekistan Hello Everyone, I have been following this group for almost 5+ years now. Thanks for all the great content.

I am inspired by the other post about Firing in Argentine and wanted to share my story here.  I really wish we see more posts from Central Asian countries.

I am in my 30s, originally from Uzbekistan and living in the US now.

I started my fire journey 6 years ago with 30k student loan.

**Networth:  \~$1 mln as of this month, split as follows:**

* 60% - Sp500 and Bonds
* 10% - Cash
* 10% - Equity in my house
* 20% - Individual tech stocks

Iam planning to retire with my family in Uzbekistan later in my 40s. Even though I like high quality healthcare,  less corruption and great perks/services (food and travelling) in the US, I miss my close friends and relatives, social gatherings with them.

Cost of Living in Uzbekistan is very little outside of capital city Tashkent.  $2k is more than enough in many regions there for rent, childcare and food.  The only problem is poor healthcare, in both private and public sector.

4% rule says I can retire today and go back but I want to work little bit more since I am making good earnings now and besides I enjoy my work.

Another motivation to keep working is that I would like to experience comfort life where I drive nice car and buy cool gifts for my family and close friends :). Ideally I would stop working once I have $4-5 mln, but that may never happen.

2023-12-18,$100k - An Immigrant's Journey,"$100k - An Immigrant's Journey After years of reading other people's posts, I can finally make my own. Shout out to u/negativemoney for the great structure and formatting that I'm following. Hopefully, this post can encourage people who earn a modest income. You don't have to make 6 figures like a lot of posts you see to make progress towards financial independence! (although that would be much faster lol). Long post incoming!

  
**Summary**  
Reached $100k net worth in about 6.5 years since I started tracking my finances at 22. Truly wish I started earlier but better late than never. Started at -$8k and very slowly, painfully, made my way to the most difficult milestone (after passing the $0 mark), despite what I would consider quite a low-ish income. My goal was to reach $100k by 30 so I'm pleased that I'm about a year early in reaching that. Income around $20k-$50k.

  
**Background**  
Currently 29 years old, single (not for long), and living in a LCOL city in the southern part of the US. Came as an international student a decade ago and I have just been trying to do my best despite all the challenges every immigrant is familiar with. I was always told that if you do well in school, you'll get a good job and life will be great. Nope. Biggest life lesson so far is that you can do everything ""right"" in life and still not get where you expect to be due to many factors. I don't ""deserve"" anything and I have to fight to move forward in everything. Life is complicated and unpredictable. All we can do is just to keep going and try to improve ourselves and our situation every day. 

  
All that to say, I know I could've done more to improve my situation back then. I'm not blaming anyone (including myself) nor do I have any bitterness. I made decisions that I thought was best at the time and learnt immensely from all the mistakes I made along the way. I just wanted to share what objectively happened and maybe the reasons why I made certain choices.

  
**Process**  
**2016:** Graduated undergrad with a finance degree from a small private university. I did very well in school, graduating with a 3.98 GPA and multiple academic awards. In my mind, that should get me a decent job at a bank or an investment firm somewhere. I was able to get into interviews no problem because of that; however, things always stop as soon as I mentioned I needed a visa sponsorship. Nobody is willing to hire even for the first year of which I don't even need a sponsorship. I also don't have any real world experience because we're not allowed to work off campus so I can't do what most finance students do like interning, working part-time at banks and firms, etc. I was also in a toxic relationship that I should've ended a long time ago but didn't have the backbone to do so, so it was quite a stressful time. To somewhat understand my future decisions, we have to also talk about the immigration process post-graduation. 

  
For those who are unfamiliar with this process, international students get between 1-2.5 years of temporary work permit. After that, you'll have to be sponsored for a work visa, which is extremely difficult to get. If you work for a normal company, you'll have to go through a grueling lottery process and there's a huge chance that you won't even get it. This is the reason most companies are unwilling to spend the time, labor and costs to hire an international student. You can skip this lottery process if you work for a non-profit educational institution like a university which leads me to my first job working at one doing a business reporting/admissions job at $29k/year. Not exactly where I expected to be but at least I don't have any student debt (the negative net worth will be explained in 2017). I was also running out of time to keep myself in good status immigration wise so I didn't really have much choice but to take the job. 

  
I've always been a saver but not an investor yet. All my positive net worth is just sitting in a savings account. I do have a tiny bit of 403b (401k for non-profits) money from my time working full-time but it's barely $2k iirc.

  
**2017**: 8 months in, I did well at my job and was promised to be sponsored for a work visa. However, things fell through at the last minute and they decided not to sponsor. Because I was told about this really late, I didn't have a backup plan which is kind of my fault. It was too late to apply to most graduate schools and I didn't want to go home. I ended up enrolling for an MBA program at the same university and resigned my job to be a student worker (international students can only work 20 hours/week during the semester). The cost for this program is where the negative net worth came from. Not a loan or anything, I just included the entire balance as a negative item in my net worth. My new boss was kind enough to pay me a higher salary than most student workers ($15/hr instead of $7.25/hr) but because of the limited hours my income this year was only around $15k. I kept building my savings.

  
**2018:** Not much changed. Still working the same student worker job while doing my MBA. Getting worried about graduation and going through the stress of not finding a job all over again. Income only around $13k. Still saving what I can.

  
**2019:** Graduated with my MBA top of my class with a 4.0 GPA and ran into exactly the same problem. The MBA didn't help one bit as long as I still have this sponsorship thing blocking my way. At this point, I was considering changing my career trajectory, at least temporarily, because I didn't see any entry path for me in the finance world. I was always good with numbers, Excel, etc. so I asked our Director of Analytics if I could come learn in the office and pick up some more skills, which is more computer science related. This ended up being a job offer but at the most inopportune time. Our institution was going through significant budget cuts and so the offered salary was much, much lower than what the previous person was making. Ran out of time with no other choice so I took it. Income is now $20k. Started contributing again to the 403b just to get the employer-match at 3% and a small amount to HSA.  I also ended my toxic relationship which was incredibly freeing!

  
**2020:** Decided to take advantage of the free tuition benefit while working this job. Started a 2nd Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Math minor for a solid foundation in case I want to go into quantitative fields in the future like Data Science, AI, ML, etc. OPT (temporary work permit) also ended but my workplace decided to sponsor me for the work visa this time which is huge. Hoping to get a significant bump in pay but only got $33k so that's my new salary. Started buying stocks at the bottom of the market in March and increased HSA contribution to $100/month.

  
**2021:** Direct supervisor left. One of the best supervisors I've had. Taught me everything I know and is the one who kept pushing for higher salary and sponsorships for me (unfortunately not up to my supervisor). I picked up the huge workload left behind and basically worked both positions. I was waiting about any news of a raise/salary adjustment but didn't hear anything about it so I went in to ask for the raise and got $37k. Unfortunately, this means that after working for 2 years, and now working basically 2 positions, I still don't even make what the person I replaced in 2019 made. Why don't I just leave you ask? It's not that simple for internationals because our options are really limited by immigration laws. Also, I see this as the most probable route to a green card which I'm hoping will pay off in the long run. I did get a couple of stimulus checks which I put straight into YOLO and meme stocks (i know.. what a donut move lol). It did really well in 2021 obviously but due to my inexperience, I didn't sell any of it. An expensive financial lesson about to hit me in the face next year.

  
**2022:** Not much changed work wise. Someone was hired to help me but the previous department had nobody that can replace this person so I'm slowly training them but still doing most things myself. High point of the year is starting a relationship with someone I knew from back home, although they are currently outside the country. Complete 180 from my previous toxic relationship. Incredibly fulfilling, full of acceptance, truly makes me incredibly happy and hopeful. There was also an institution-wide 2% raise. Income now at $38k. Personal stock portfolio is in the toilet due to incredibly risky stocks that plummeted in 2022. I also had $2k tied in BlockFi who went bankrupt. Hopefully I recover some from that but I've considered it gone. Thankfully a majority of my investments are diversified index funds so my incredibly stupid decisions hurt but are not catastrophic by any means. Got my WSB fun run, but never again. Learnt a ton about stocks and the effects of macroeconomics, geopolitics, etc. on the market.

  
**2023:** First work visa is expiring in July. Talked about the visa renewal as well as the possibility of a green card sponsorship. They decided that they're going to do it which is a HUGE first step towards having equal footing in life. Coworker almost left to another institution because he was offered much more than what he's making here but eventually got hired by another department that matched that so I'm alone again. Again asked for a raise and was given $50k which is still $10k less than what my previous supervisor was making 4 years ago with 2 more people on staff. Getting married soon so I'm expecting quite a bit of expenses in terms of moving, lawyer fees, etc. as well as additional life expenses because my spouse can't work until we get our green cards. Thankfully, my future spouse is incredibly reasonable and we both compromised greatly from our idea of an ""ideal"" wedding. We're spending about $3k in total. Also got a 5% institution-wide bonus midway through the year which came to around $1.7k. Reached $100k in December after the November rally! Increased my contributions for various things.

$50 - Internet  
$25 - Cell Phone  
$200 - Groceries & Eating Out  
\~$850 left over

  
There's no secret tips/tricks to this. I cook my own food, rarely eat out, live very close to work, drive a 15 year old Corolla, don't buy random stuff, and just generally frugal. I also make a couple hundred every year from credit card cashback. I know most people don't recommend using credit cards but I've never been a spender and never paid a single cent in interest so credit card cashback have actually made me quite a bit of money over the years lol. My destress methods include working out, playing video games, watching shows and reading books. As you can see I still have some room in my current budget which covers miscellaneous expenses if they pop up; otherwise, I've recently put them into buying all those T-Bills or covering the wedding expenses. Almost all my money is working for me, either in tax advantaged accounts, HYSA, or temporarily sitting in money market.

  
**Savings/Investing (S/I) and Spending Rate:**  
I also started tracking my savings and spending rate in 2021 and here's the breakdown. These are all compared to gross income.

  
**2021:**  
S/I Rate: 48%  
Spend Rate: 28%  
Avg S/I/Month: $1,775  
Avg Spend/Month: $1,065

  
**2022:**  
S/I Rate: 41%  
Spend Rate: 39%  
Avg S/I/Month: $1,303  
Avg Spend/Month: $1,237

  
**2023:**  
S/I Rate: 42%  
Spend Rate: 40%  
Avg S/I/Month: $1,600  
Avg Spend/Month: $1,561

  
I find it helpful to see this trend. I'm aware the ratio is worsening lol but also 2023 was an anomaly because I spent quite a bit on traveling with my future spouse and the wedding of course. This will hopefully improve next year. 

  
**Future Plans/Goals:**  
\- Increase my income. I'll have more leverage and options to do this once I get my green card. For now, I just have to stay the course.  
\- Keep maxing out my HSA and IRA, increase until max my 403b contribution and hopefully all my spouse's tax advantaged accounts as well (401k, IRA, HSA).  
\- Finish my 3rd degree. Working and studying at the same time is really tough but I knew I had to make the best of my time and resources while I can. This should help me be more well-rounded in terms of skills and open a lot of doors in the future.  
\- Reach $250k NW before 35. Thought that's an optimistic yet reasonable goal assuming everything stays the same.  
\- Buying a house when it makes sense for us. With my current income, the current interest rate, housing market, my spouse moving, immigration situation, etc. it doesn't seem like it makes sense to buy a house anytime soon but it's definitely something we're thinking to get one day.  
\- $2M is the current FIRE goal. $80k/year will be heavenly and will allow me to quit working completely. I know I'm only 5% there... idk if I'll ever reach it but moving towards a goal is better than standing still.  
\- Kids are someting we talked about extensively. For me, having kids is a function of money. I personally don't want one but if we have enough for both of us to retire, then I'm open to having kids. I'm perfectly happy to spend on us and never having any kids. My future spouse feels the same way for now but this might change in the future? We'll have to see.  
\- Enjoy life and the process along the way. I'm an overplanner so it's very easy for me to look too far ahead and obsess over every dollar. My spouse is definitely more an ""enjoy the present"" kind of person but also understands my goals and fully supports it. Really helps me smell the roses along the way so to speak, which I greatly appreciate.

  
Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Hopefully it encourages you since my income is much closer to the average American. Discipline and self-control are incredibly critical at our level of income because we don't have much wiggle room. Anyway, see you all at $250k!",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-12-15,Big NW milestone for an expat in Asia - Budget and NW development breakdown,"Big NW milestone for an expat in Asia - Budget and NW development breakdown I am a 36yo German who has been working and living in Taiwan for a little over 5 years. I have been seriously focusing on saving and investing for the last 6 years. Before that I was playing around with stocks but didn't have a consistent plan or that much extra income to invest. With the latest market surge I have now reached the milestone of $500k in liquid investments (plus a stake in a startup) and thought it would be a good occasion to summarize the journey so far. This text is probably mostly for myself to gain some perspective in the process of putting everything together.

My wife and I have separate assets but I cover most of our expenses. We also have one child. She contributes \~$930/month (my wife not the kid) and saves a good amount of her salary (which I am not counting here). Our shared costs are \~$4,690 and my personal expenses are \~$550. So I spend around \~$4,310 per month which comes up to $51,720 while making \~$122,000/year (net/post tax/including all bonuses) plus \~$4,000 in live poker earnings (average over the last three years). So I can invest \~$74,280 a year. When I was living alone I could save up to $90,000/year but I hope increase my salary further to get back into that ballpark.

My employer also pays $3500/year into the national pension fund for me. I will get access to that money if I leave TW or turn 60 years old. The fund has returned around 4% over the last 10 years. I could match that amount pre-tax but I prefer to take the tax hit and invest the money myself instead and hopefully get higher returns. I am not counting the money in that account for now. I also have a small claim on a pension/social security from working in Germany and Switzerland. I will liquidate the Swiss portion soon (can't do that in Germany).

I am not spending money unnecessarily but also don't live overly frugally. Living expenses here are very manageable - especially restaurants and all kinds of services are very affordable. So meeting up with friends is not too expensive and there are a ton of great outdoor activities available which are basically free. The car is an old Mitsubishi beater that my wife took over from her parents but parking, insurance, tax etc. still cost money. We have a nice apartment on a really good deal (in return we pay for upgrades ourselves). Also, kids are expensive and visiting Europe once a year as a family is not as cheap as doing it alone.

The budget below was done in the local currency and then transferred into $USD, so the numbers are all uneven.

**NW development by age:**

**18:** 		\~$2,500 from birthday money and math tutoring. (2005)

**19-23:** 	\~$17,000 from playing online poker while finishing a master's degree in economics. Parents supported a cheap student lifestyle while in uni. Education is free in Germany. (2006-2010)

**24-27:** 	\~$25,000 Saving some money while working in politics but no more poker. (2011-2014)

**28-29:**	  \~$15,000 Doing another master's degree in Finance & Controlling because I wanted to work in a field where I can utilize my biggest strength (data affinity) the most. Living off of savings and a side job in accounting. (2015-2016)

**30-31:** 	\~$60,000 Working for a Big4 company in Switzerland while seriously saving. Net salary after health insurance and food allowance (significant in consulting/audit) was around was around $68k. (2017-2018)

**32-33:** 	\~$175,000 Getting the opportunity to go to TW for a Global company and earning a management promotion within roughly a year. Starting salary still around $68k net (but cheaper CoL), the management position bumped that to \~$85k. I was not fully invested in the market during the Covid crash and DCA'd back in after (too slow in hindsight - now I always do lump sum). Started an advisory role in a startup (in exchange for stock options) as a side-project and gave $25k seed money as well. (2019-2020)

**34-35:** 	\~$325,000 Market goes mostly well (2022 hurt a bit). I get another promotion to a Director role after 3 years in TW (salary + bonuses varies a bit but last year was $122k net total). I am getting married and have a kid. I can't live as frugally anymore but the higher salary obviously helps. (2021-2022)

**36:** 		\~$500,000 Another good market year. Multi-year bets on Alphabet and Microsoft are paying off but I move most of my portfolio (75%) into market ETFs. (2023)

I have no real estate and no debt. The startup I am consulting and invested in is doing pretty well by now and the expected Series A valuation puts my stake at roughly \~$250k (seed stake + stock options) but I won't be able to get any money out for a few more years and would probably owe some tax on any potential gains (depending on holding period) so I am not counting it into liquid assets at the moment.

**Current Portfolio Allocation**

FTSE All World / VWCE - 54.6%

S&P 500 / SXR8 - 17.7%

MICROSOFT - 8.5%

PALANTIR - 4.3%

COCA-COLA - 2.0%

RESTAURANT BRANDS INTL - 1.4%

&#x200B;

Ethereum - 1.5%

Bitcoin - 1.3%

&#x200B;

Physical Gold - 3.6%

Pensions & Life Insurance (both about to be liquidated) - 3.4%

Cash & Equivalents - 1.7%

My plan is to retire (or just work on my own projects) at around 45 yo with a 3% SWR. I only expect minimal public pension payments. If the startup investment turns out somewhat okay and the market doesn't take a nosedive, \~$2.0M-$2.5M should be a realistic number by then, especially if I can increase my salary/bonuses further or maybe can get another consulting gig going.

Combined Salary: $240K (Big Tech (M), and Market Research(F))

* Traditional IRA: $245K
* Roth IRA: $193K
* Taxable brokerage: $140K
* HSA: $23K
* Cash: 54K

Total Net Worth: $655K

Net Worth does not include Real Estate:

* Condo bought in 2016 for $135K with interest rate of 3.875%, $98K left on the loan. Current market value $195K. have been renting out for the past 3 years, with cash flow of \~$350 per month. \~$100K in equity
* Townhouse bought in 2020 for $450K with interest rate of 2.625%, $390K left on the loan. Recently got the house appraised at $525K to remove the PMI and reduce monthly payments. $135K in equity.

Also not including $14K in Crypto

We are currently maxing out out 401K IRA, Roth IRA, and HSA. Investing \~$105K in to the market annually. Most of this is in index funds such as VOO and VTSAX. Got lucky with some stock picking early on in TSLA, AMD, NFLX, and other tech stocks. 20% of portfolio in company stock (ESPP/RSUs) which is big tech and expect this stock to do well the 5-10 ten years (there is exposure in this but plan to de-risk as we get closer to reaching FIRE).

We would ideally like to FIRE in 2032 with $2M with a SWR of 3% which would be $60K annually. With current rate of investment of $105K annually and annual growth rate of 7%, I believe we should get there. Our expenses are relatively low with all in cost of $2.2K per month for housing (including cash flow from condo) $2.8K monthly groceries/gas/eating out and saving for travel (we try to travel 4/5 times out the year to new countries). We share a car and have no car payments.

We are open to do Barista FIRE if needed (pick up side jobs/ pursue passion projects) and have also considered living over seas (Thailand) and move back and forth. The wildcard would be health care and have not looked too much into this.

Is this a feasible/realistic plan based on our timeline?

**What went well**

- Lucky to be born in Bay Area, California. Had nutritious food only by the grace of the free school lunch program for many years.
- Started reading /r/personalfinance and /r/financialindependence before entering university.

- Getting 0% loans, grants, and scholarships to pay for all my schooling.
- Pivoting to Computer Science for high pay.

- Lots of health issues due to my upbringing/nutritional deficiencies/etc. Have a heart rhythm disorder. As well as (in diagnostic order from real psychiatrists): depression, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, PMDD. Most of these have gotten better with a lot of work and money. Lifelong conditions. Work exacerbates them. Hence, wanting to retire early.
- Took too long to realize I needed workplace accommodations. 

**What I wish I did instead if I had a crystal ball**

- Would have preferred buying a house solo in 2021.
- Sold company stock when it was at an all-time high at the pandemic, and buy it back when it crashed shortly after.

**Overall conclusion**

Doing really well for the hand I was dealt. On track for early retirement in 6-7 years. Thanks everyone for the advice over the years.

2023-12-02,"(m21)I feel content at ~24k a year, why all the pressure to make more money?","(m21)I feel content at ~24k a year, why all the pressure to make more money? Hello financial people, bear with me🐻, it sounds like something that should be on r/simpleliving, but I wanted to share an interesting perspective. I’d say I am pretty lucky and privileged given my circumstances. 
I feel pretty financially independent in my life already as I have all of my needs met and most of my wants met, with TONS of free time. And I try to understand why go through all the hassle for MORE? 

Wondering if some of you have felt the same way and what changed your mind to acquire more wealth? 

And Would YOU say that I am already financially independent given my goals and contentment?

Here’s some stats…

-I live in Chico California, in a semi modern 2 bedroom apartment with one Roomate(great location right near downtown)-$600/mo

-my income is just doordash 4-5 hours a day

-phone paid $30/mo(cell service)

-car paid for and runs great(vintage 4x4);)

-my e-moped loan is $100/mo
(I use this for doordash) 

-my insurance is $60/mo

-student loans $50/mo

-I GET NO FINANCIAL HELP FROM FAMILY
(Other than small presents for the holidays)

- $1400 emergency fund in a high yield savings account. (Not great Ik but I add 3-400 to it every month)

-trade school at cc(free tuition)

LONG TERM MONEY GOALS:
-some sort of retirement
-move to denmark(my long term gf is a citizen)
-continue doing the hobbies I enjoy!

I am able to afford a lot of things I enjoy too, I go on surf trips every month and visit family, go on dates with my girlfriend and sometimes eat out. I’m really into watercoloring rn. And I get plenty of exercise running,hiking or yoga/weight lifting at home. 

So the consensus is I feel like I am at the perfect balance of work/life. But my parents/media urge me to have a high salary career, degree, house, children, ect. For what!? Don’t feel very hungry for those goals, lots of commitment/responsibility in a career sounds dreadful, I enjoy apartment living/roomates and the thought of kids scare me and my girlfriend anyways, I can barely take care of my plants (also having children is one of worst things you could do to the environment). So I feel like going to school is setting me up for “golden shackles”. Im seeing a pattern that the standard of living keeps getting higher, and it’s like “you have to be a bodybuilder now in order to be considered healthy” 

Anyways LIFES DUCKING GREAT! The only things that could make me feel insecure about my income are health insurance(when 25) ,retirement, a medical emergency and a recession. Which the last 2 I feel like could frick anyone up regardless. 
I think if I made over 50k, I’d have so much excess I wouldn’t know what to do with it( I’d be working way more with no time to do anything fun too).

2023-11-28,Advice for early retirement to take care of sick partner,"Advice for early retirement to take care of sick partner Hi All,

I am a newbie here looking for financial advice to retire early and take care of my partner, who is sick. I believe this is the right place to ask this question, but if not, I would appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction.

Let me provide a bit of background first. I am 41 years old, long-term committed to a partner with no kids. My partner was diagnosed with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) with chronic schizophrenia, depression, and other mental health issues. She has been diagnosed for several years, and given this, she needs full-time care. She is currently staying with her parents, who are taking care of her while I have a job to pay the bills and try to save as much as I can. My partner’s parents are getting older, and I want to quit my job in the next 1-3 years so that my partner can stay with me. I want to take care of her full-time.

I realize it might be difficult for me to retire this early in the next couple of years, but I am trying to save for the future as much as I can, and I am open to any advice you can offer, whether it is investing in different stocks, reducing expenses, or anything at all.

Here is my financial info:

Emergency funds: $15k in bank, cover 3-6 months expense

Debt: Mortgage, $65k (outstanding balance). 2.75% fixed interest rate. Minimal credit card debt.

Tax Filing Status: Single (partner’s parents have legal guardianship for her and they are filing on their behalf)

Tax Rate: 24% Federal, 2.5% State

Age:41

Asset allocation: 100% stocks (I realize this might be aggressive but thought this might be needed in the short-term and then can allocate more to non-stocks once I retire)

Portfolio size: $860,000

Taxable investment:

34% Carnival Corp (CCL)

11% Apple Inc (AAPL)

6% T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) (0.67%)

401k:

29.5% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Institutional Shares (VITSX) (0.030%)

Rollover IRA:

18% Tesla Inc (TSLA)

0.6% T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) (0.67%)

Roth IRA:

0.9% Microsoft (MSFT)

Annual Contributions

$10,000 employer match for 401k at Vanguard

Key Points

My partner does not have any income. She is disabled full-time. She receives about $500 in Social Security disability monthly and about $300 in food stamp to pay for her own expenses.

My annual income right now is about $110,000 and expense is about $36,000 and I expect to reduce expense to about $24,000 after I retire (assuming mortgage is paid off and having to purchase my own medical insurance.

I think I covered key points but feel free to ask if you need more information.

Question:

Based on my situation, is it possible for me to retire in the next 1-3 years? If so, could you provide guidance on how I can do so?

I am thinking to have stable income of at least 25,000 annually (maybe a little more for emergency) after retirement to pay for the bills and I plan to live minimalist as much as possible. To do this, I am wondering if I should invest in CD or money market account to have 4-5% interest rate in retirement. Right now, I have about $430,000 in taxable investment so do I have to grow this to at least $800,000 and invest this in CD or money market account to have steady retirement interest income with about $25,000 annually? I don’t know if I can double my investment in the next couple of years so this is kind of a long shot and main reason I am investing everything in stocks with couple of maybe risky equities.

Any adjustment I should make to my portfolio or any other suggestions? I am open to any feedback that can help me to retire early and to be with my partner and take care of her. Achieving financial freedom is important for me and well-being of my partner and any advice you can provide is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time to read about my situation.

2023-11-17,What would you do in my situation as a 22 year old?,"What would you do in my situation as a 22 year old? What are you doing in my situation?

What are you doing in my situation?

So I just recently turned 22 in September. I currently have my own business selling product online and wholesale to different stores across the US. Right now, I’m currently sitting on $21.5k in ROTH IRA, $77k in a taxable investment account, $2.5K in crypto, and $53k in 5.05% HYSA. Aside from that, I have about $95K in business inventory and $50K in Business Checking. I also have a small collection of watches worth about $35K, a paid off Tesla Model 3, and I still live with my parents rent-free.

Here is my investment portfolio breakdown:
170.7 Shares of AAPL (Weekly Recurring $225 Buy)
62 Shares of VOO (Weekly Recurring $225 Buy)
76 Shares of QQQ (Weekly Recurring $225 Buy)
40.5 Shares of TSLA (No Recurring Buy)
5 Shares of PYPL (Randomly bought this, down 70%)
$1.5K cash sitting in ROTH
$2.5K split between BTC and ETH

I’m wondering if I am being too conservative, i.e. should I empty the HYSA and buy more into the market? Maybe I use that bit of cash to reinvest into my business? Or even consider purchasing another business (Ideally like a small boba tea or food shop)? Do I open a SEP-IRA and do a backdoor now? Consider buying a house? Really not sure if I’m in a position to make a big move, or if I just continue working and investing as I’ve been.

For reference: My taxes this year will probably be $170K-220K AGI, so probably $60-80K in tax liability.

Any thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-11-11,Thank you!!!,"Thank you!!! I wanted to celebrate a pretty significant win on our family’s journey and thank the community.  We are a married couple with two kids, each work for the same employer with six figure incomes but nothing close to faang compensations.  If all goes well we will be able to walk away at 55; full but not fat FIRE.  

Since discovering FIRE, I’ve read about the Mega Back Door ROTH IRA rollover but  never been able to make it work for us.  I took a deep dive with our provider about 7 years ago only to find a dead end.  

Last year our company switched investment providers who recently announced new options for 2024 including a Roth 401k.  This announcement caused my partner to probe me and ask if this would change anything for us (I do all the detailed reading, learning, and investing), which led me to do some research.  After an hour reading the plan literature, poking around the website, and walking through the withdrawal process forms (without completing the transaction) I couldn’t find anything enabling a roll over to a Roth IRA. However, I was able to see that I could withdrawal exclusively after tax funds, which was not available with the previous provider.  That little crumb caused me to call and speak with a representative, as many on here have suggested.  Then after calling three times, I found the right person.  20 minutes later we had rolled all of our after tax funds to our Roth IRAs with the earnings going to our traditional IRAs!  We did it!  We just pulled off the mega back door, what a day!  

This came ten years after first reading about the MBD, So I just wanted to drop in and express my gratitude while encouraging others to never give up!  Calling to speak with a rep was crucial as they told me they had to fill out a manual form and this would not be possible via the website.  I also needed to find someone who knew what I was asking for, hence the three calls.  Lastly, having a supportive, committed partner proved critical.  I wouldn’t have looked so closely had she not nudged me. 

Now to my spreadsheet to see the long term implications😎.  Modeling scenarios with a spreadsheet is definitely one of my favorite parts of FIRE, and since we are squarely in the Boring middle I haven’t had much to “work out” there in years…fun, fun, fun!! 

Thank You r/financialindependence!  I hope this inspires one of you to take a closer look and hit the jackpot like we did.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-11-10,"""I resign. This is effective immediately""","""I resign. This is effective immediately"" About 1.5 years ago I joined a FAANG corp. Within two months I hated it. The team I worked with was fine, but my manager was, and forever will be, an uninspiring corporate tool. The predictable lingo, the unimaginative goals, the bureaucratic and impersonal 1-on-1s, the lack of empathy and support, just an all-around waste of carbon. I put up with it for a year because the money was pretty good, but when he started to push the Return To Office crap I couldn't anymore. One day I got an email from him about an RTO date with HR on the thread, so I responded with the above, closed my laptop, and never looked back. Took a couple of vacations before starting my job hunt and in 3 weeks found a new one earning a little less but way better in every other measure. 

I was only able to do this because for the last 10 years we've built a safety net giving my wife and I the financial freedom to walk away from a shitty situation on a dime.

2023-10-23,Newbie on FI/FIRE. Any suggestion is welcomed.,"Newbie on FI/FIRE. Any suggestion is welcomed. Hi, I’m a 33 yo FM living in HCOL in MD. I recently moved out from my family and started paying more attention to FIRE. The majority of posts here are from people making $100K+, so I really hope to find someone in similar situation with me and learn.

Background: My family are immigrants and have been working minimum wage jobs so that my brother and I could focus on school. I switched majors when moving here, because of that, I started working late, but thankfully I saved up and cut many expenses by living with my parents. Also, I was lucky to have landed a govie job, making \~ $ 80K. I pay my family’s phone bill, parents’ health insurance, and when we dine out most of the time. 

  
Now I rent an apartment myself and realize that my financial literacy is poor. I do spend money when needed and for socializing and vacation, but without a detailed plan in mind before since I’ve been saving up a lot. I was either frugal or wasted money because something was on sale or because I liked the item although it was unnecessary (under $100 though). So now I try to be more responsible/reasonable. Here is the breakdown of my worth:

  
•	Net income: \~ $ 3700/mo  
•	Checking: $ 3500  
•	HSA: $ 28K (4.3% APY) and $ 52K (4.5% APY)  
•	$ 10K in CD (3.9% APY, 11mo term)  
•	$ 10K in CD (3.9% APY, 6mo term)  
•	401k: $ 39K  
•	Brokerage acc: $ 5K  
•	Roth IRA: $ 6K

  
My expenses:  
•	Rent + utilities + wifi: \~ $ 1650/mo   
•	Car fuel: \~ $ 86 - $ 120/mo  
•	Mom\_hospital bill: $ 42/mo   
•	Mom\_insurance: $ 514/mo  
•	Food\_max allowed for myself:  \~ $ 150/mo  
•	Gym: $10/mo

  
I always pay my credit card in full and on-time  . Own an old car, no debt. My emergency fund is mainly my HSA. I know my investment decision is not the best as I’m afraid of negative return in my brokerage acc despite knowing I should look into it for long term gain. My future goals are to buy a new car, give the current one to my brother, have a pet, or find a bit nicer place to rent, and continue supporting my parents, but I’m not sure if I can do all of that soon. Btw, I always have the anxiety that I don't save/ am prepared enough. My friends, who are immigrants, can afford paying for theirs and their parents' rent and take them on vacation. 

  
Is there anything I can improve? I’m not looking for a roommate though. Please excuse me if my post is too vague or too detailed. Thanks!  
  Edit: I mean HYSA, not HSA. Sorry!

2023-10-17,What software or system do you use to budget for FIRE?,"What software or system do you use to budget for FIRE? I'm a recent college graduate and I'm fortunate enough to have paid off my tuition with part-time work + my parents' help. Right now I'm living with my parents to save up for a downpayment so I can move out into my own apartment.

I don't have much in the way of expenses at the moment, maybe $100 a month on my phone bill, gas, and the occasional coffee, and put the rest in a HYSA and Roth, so I haven't had much of a budget. In the near future though, I'll need to be a lot more attentive about my cashflow so I'm wondering how everyone else manages it. What software do you use?

2023-10-15,"Seeking advice, thoughts: I think we've FIRE'd?","Seeking advice, thoughts: I think we've FIRE'd? **Life Situation:**

* Married 38F to 38M
* both live and work in the SF Bay Area (yes, in tech)
* no kids, no plans for any
* still currently working
* my husband wants to retire in March 2024
* I want to retire May 2024

**FIRE Progress:**

* I think we've FIREd. I guess I'm looking for a gut/sanity check from you guys.
* I've always been interested in FIRE, but I was never very ""proactive"" about it. I basically just kept thinking, ""Well, we make a lot of money, so I'll just plan to really dig into the numbers later and tentatively plan for us to retire at age 45.""
* Recently, due to both my husband and I being very stressed at work and dissatisfied with working in general, we thought, ""What if we take a year or two off of work?"" For me that became, ""Why don't we really sit down and look through the numbers to see if we can just retire now?""
* We went through all the numbers (below) and now we're like, ""Uh, I guess we can retire now?"" so now we want to retire next spring after we get our bonuses and (for me) after a batch of RSUs vest.

**Gross Salary/Wages:** It's probably the most helpful to know Total Compensation rather than our salaries because we both get bonuses and RSUs. Here's our combined W-2 box 1 for the last 4 years:

* 2022: $799k
* 2021: $918k
* 2020: $756k
* 2019: $609k

**Savings/Assets:**

* Tax-advantaged accounts (401ks, IRAs, HSA) total: $1.3M
* After-tax accounts (various index funds, other mutual funds - both stocks and bonds, company stocks, other stocks, normal checking and savings accounts) total: $3.3M
* Other (CDs, ibonds) total: $115k
* Primary Residence (condo): Worth about $1.2M. Mortgage has $410k left.

**Expenses:**

We typically spend about $100k/year. I don't really have more detailed breakdown than this:

* Mortgage P+I for our condo: $1727/mo
* Condo insurance: $472/yr
* HOA (includes trash/water): $354/mo
* Property tax: $9k/yr
* Other personal property insurance: $489/yr
* Auto insurance: $2500/yr for 2 cars
* Vehicle reg: $1100/yr
* Gas/electricity: avg $250/mo
* Internet: $134/mo
* Security: $100/yr
* Cell phone: $283/mo
* Gym: $45/mo
* Food: $15k/yr (I love eating so I intentionally spend a lot here)
* The remaining is just spent on random shopping and stuff.

**Expected Expenses in Retirement:**

We plan on traveling a lot more, so I would ballpark our possible expenses reaching $150k/yr at the most, but mostly staying at around $100k/yr and of course being flexible to spend less when we need to.

**Liabilities:**

Mortgage has $410k left. We refi'ed in Dec 2020 at 2.5%. I think we'll eventually sell and move somewhere lower COL, buying something outright. Haven't really decided yet.

**One thing we haven't figured out yet:**

How much medical will cost after retirement. I assume it will be a lot but I put a bunch of padding for this in newretirement.com.

**Post-Retirement plans:**

We'll probably just spend a couple of months just getting used to not working every day, I guess? I want to go to Europe on vacation summer of 2024 for our 15th wedding anniversary. At some point maybe next year or 2025, we want to buy an RV and travel around the US to try to find a new forever home. Other than those bigger things, we have plenty of smaller things we want to do more of when we're not exhausted from work: play video games, read books, go on tons of hikes, going camping, etc.

**Specific Question(s):**

I guess just what are you guys' thoughts? What would you do if you were us? Any red flags? Other considerations I'm not thinking of? Such a big life change as retiring is still scary for me to think of. Like, wait, are we really doing this? But I really want to get away from working this job I hate even though it pays a lot. I keep reminding myself that earning money just for the sake of it is pointless. I ran all our numbers through cfiresim, firecalc, newretirement.com, etc, and I think we're already ""made it"".

I’ve recently started making great income (about $500k/yr and growing) for my business and I have a pathway to double that income next year. All as a solopreneur and taxable as an LLC. 

I’ve been able to load a Marcus HYSA with $100k after starting in January - though I will owe most to the IRS in taxes unless I find the right investments or legal avenues. 

I’m exploring moving my LLC to an S Corp and doing a mega backdoor IRA, but I’m not sure about the tax implications. I’m also uneasy about the stock market or real estate in this everything bubble. Though I am considering putting 15% per month into VOO, VUG, and SCHD at some smart diversification. 

Alternatively, I am considering legal fees for a RLT and set up dual LLCs for operating and assets (trifecta) and organize accordingly. Legal fees and a tax advisor + accountant would be a big write off. And I could invest another $50k into the business for PR and improved operations for scaling a licensed model.

2023-09-20,[5 year update] 38/m/single. $2.3 million. Submitted my resignation letter today. Thank you guys for the encouragement all these years.,"[5 year update] 38/m/single. $2.3 million. Submitted my resignation letter today. Thank you guys for the encouragement all these years. Hi, Reddit. I posted about reaching FIRE in 2018 when I was 38 - am 43 now. Had a general plan at the time to go travel the country and world after having my nose to the grindstone since my 20s living frugally and saving and not doing much else. Retired at $2.3 million with a paid off single family home and no debt, with expectation to help care for my elderly immigrant parents who have little/no retirement savings. I'm from the southern US.

**Day 1**

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8pv2yd/38msingle_23_million_submitted_my_resignation/

>I have had this job for over a decade out of grad school. Pay is solid, hours are great and I didn't hate the work, but my heart has been out of it for awhile. 

>Salary varied anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 during those 14 years or so. I live in a state with low cost of living and no state income tax, so I knew when I started that I could save a majority of my income if I stayed frugal and resisted lifestyle inflation. I live in the same starter home I bought around 2010 and drive an old Camry. I did a bunch of set-it-and-forget-it buying of large cap US index funds and Berkshire Hathaway and I did some individual buying of large cap bank and technology names before and after the Great Recession

**Year 1 update - I volunteered in southeast Asia as a teacher in Bangkok.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bk1rco/1_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

>I moved to Thailand to volunteer at a non-profit teaching English to former prostitutes and low-level criminals for tourism industry jobs.

>I knew the cost of living in Bangkok would be substantially cheaper than what I am used to paying, but I was not prepared as to how much cheaper. My apartment and utilities were provided for free by the non-profit and I lived with my fellow expat volunteers. Some were older couples who wanted their privacy, so they booked their own apartments. Costs ranged from as low as $200 a month for a cheap, non-furnished studio apartment to $375 a month for a furnished studio in a newer building near a Skytrain station in the center of town with security. I was pleasantly surprised that because I was in the country on a sponsored work visa, I was eligible to buy health insurance there as a local. It came out to about $150 a month. Getting international expat health insurance here in America would have cost me up to $500 a month, so a huge savings. I also rarely ate at home and never cooked, since Bangkok is one of the great street food capitals of the world. All kinds of Thai, Chinese, Malay, Indian and Arab food served on the street for about 35 to 70 baht each entree (~1 to 2 bucks USD). I ended up not getting a local cell phone or local cell plan, my Sprint plan included international roaming and the 2G data was okay for Google Maps and web/email use when I was away from wifi, which was rare. So monthly fixed expenses came out to [...] $850/month total. Let's say I had to get my own furnished apartment and pay for my utilities, add another $500 a month. $1,350 a month total is pretty good considering I lived like a king and didn't budget myself at all. I could get that below $1,000 a month if I was more frugal.

>Also - about three or four months after I moved to Thailand, my former boss called me to see how I was and offered me an online-only job, where I would spend about an hour to 90 minutes a day remotely reviewing other people's work, answering internal emails and listening to ideas he would bounce off of me. I wasn't interested, but he insisted it would not be my old job, that I would still be a digital nomad and never come into the office and I would be eligible for 401k matching and the company's health insurance when I came home. So I said yes and I've been doing the job for about half a year. It's been as advertised, I set aside an hour or so a night on my laptop in front of the TV and it hasn't grown into anything bigger yet. The salary is a small, small fraction of what I used to make but it's worth my time. We'll see how things stand after another year.

**Year 2 update - I was stuck at home during COVID lockdown.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gwhxgh/2_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

>My net worth skyrocketed to over $3 million thanks to the post-China trade deal rally and the market assuming COVID-19 is contained. The abrupt, panicked selloff as the world went into lockdown knocked me back down to $2.1 million. Painful, but I rode the Great Recession all the way down and back ten years ago, so I had that experience to rely on to resist panic selling. I've since rode the April/May rally back up to $2.6 million. https://i.imgur.com/Wg7c74L.jpg

**Year 3 update - I didn't post an update because we were still in lockdown. Couldn't fly anywhere.**

>I did a lot of camping trips at state parks in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas. It was nice. Lots of exploring in towns like Taos and Durant and Turkey. Spent a lot of time with family.

**Year 4 update - Lockdown over. I accepted a volunteer position in New York City.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ydg6b5/4_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

>I went to a friend's wedding in New York City and I had such a great time that I later signed on as an unpaid volunteer with NY Cares. I'm currently based in Queens and I'll be here into December helping high schoolers and their Mandarin or Spanish-speaking families fill out their FAFSA applications. Enjoying myself very much. I'm basically a tourist all day and night.

>My net worth ... I've been on a wild ass ride since 2018 that has been bewildering and head-spinning. $2.3 million at retirement, rallied to above $3 million at the pre-COVID peak. The lockdown selloff was brutal, I was back to $2.1 million pretty quickly by summer 2020. I then put my hoarded cash to work in more big bank, tech names and leveraged ETF plays hoping to claw back to over $3 million within three years. I was floored that it ballooned to over $10 million on the backs of those leveraged bank and tech plays going parabolic and leading the market as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero (thanks ""transient inflation"") and QE going for substantially longer than anyone expected.
>https://i.imgur.com/eJbG1Vx.jpeg

>Well, that's all crashed and burned in 2022. The steady 75-basis point interest hikes beginning in the spring by the Fed to kill the +8% inflation we are enduring have torpedoed the bank and tech names in my portfolio. I'm currently at about $6.1 million, a $4 million loss from the peak. Yes, it has been exceptionally painful. I've done some selling on the rallies and other selling on stop-loss orders being triggered.
>https://i.imgur.com/EjmMPz9.jpg

>But, whatever. I knew these trades I entered into in 2020 were high risk, high reward. And I'm up over 100% on my net worth since I retired four years ago. If you would have told me then that my nest egg would balloon to over $6 million within five years, I would have done backflips.

**Today. Year 5 update - I spent the summer in China, very recently came home.**

So I was in Beijing for a wedding and then wandered the countryside for a bit with my expat friends in the country. It was lovely. Favorite place was the city of Harbin in the Heilongjiang province in the far northeast corner of China. If you superimposed a map of China onto the US, Harbin would roughly be where Vermont is. So it's cold and close to the Russian border. Lots of Russian looking Chinese people there and lots of families observing both cultures, it was cool and interesting. Lots of expat Russians there hiding from the Ukraine war. Cool locals. Spectacular cold weather food, lots of great pork stews and orange chicken. I think I ate pork belly braised in soy sauce served over white rice at least 20 times. Highly recommend Heilongjiang, it's not nearly as touristy as other places in China.

I don't think I'm ever going back to China, however. As much as I enjoyed going and as much as I enjoy Chinese culture. The surveillance state there was more unnerving than ever, everything is electronic, on video and traceable. You can't even feed yourself in many places if there is a flag that prevents you from using your phone or card. The dependence on the state for access to literally anything in day-to-day life was a constant reminder for me.

The rest of the year for me has been a bit aimless, I think I'm running out of ideas for things to do. I spent a month living in an Airbnb near Big Bend National Park. Didn't meet too many people since it's an empty desert there but the people I did meet were lovely and I got time to just relax with myself. I spent a few weeks with an ex-girlfriend, who I was with before COVID before we split up so she could take a really high paying travelling veterinarian job during lockdown. It was nice, but the spark wasn't there anymore. I'm not actively looking for anyone since I'm an introvert by nature, but I'm not against enjoying a new person's company.

I'm not bored or stressed, but I am feeling like ""what's next."" I will always keep travelling and trying to experience new places and things, but I'm pondering connecting myself to more tasks and hobbies here at home. Like I started playing disc golf the other week LOL. Have been very introspective lately and generally working on myself, more so than usual anyway.

**Net worth today** - I'm at $6.9 million as of 9/20/23. So about a 13% gain since last year's update.
https://i.imgur.com/vImOLpx.jpg

That's underperforming SPY by a bit for the past year, but I'm nonetheless pleased. Because outside of my core index fund and Berkshire Hathaway holdings, I'm heavy on the Big Six banks. And JPM/BAC/GS/etc. have taken a beating since Silicon Valley Bank failed in the spring. So all things considered, I think I've had a solid year. 

**My moves going forward** - The overwhelming majority of my wealth is tied into the stock market, so I'm pretty leery against putting new cash into stocks. First, I'm not adding any new money into my non-retirement stock holdings so I'm only making the annual max contributions into my 401(k) and HSA and putting that into the same old index funds. Slow and steady.

Second, if you have over $1 million in assets not counting your house then you qualify as an accredited investor under SEC regulations. Which then allows you to invest in stuff like private equity, commercial real estate deals and hedge funds. This stuff is all illiquid and opaque, hence the risk being elevated and the SEC not wanting everyday retail investors in them. I'm not interest right now in anything private equity or CRE due largely to interest rates being high, but I am interested in supply chain finance facilities that some hedge funds are managing that are paying 10-13 percent a year every year. So I've put some cash into that alongside my treasury buys. We'll see how that pans out.

Am thinking about my next long trip being to Mexico City, haven't been back since COVID. I miss the street tacos and ceviche. I was recently back in NYC to see friends and was shocked at how expensive hotels are now. Because of the new near-total ban on Airbnb and the city taking over hotels for migrant housing. The Hotel Indigo I usually stay at in Queens was $200 to $250 a night last year, they were asking for $450 to $500 a night this time around.

2023-09-13,How much redundancy does your savings have?,"How much redundancy does your savings have? Not sure if “redundancy” is the right word. What I mean is: level 1 of savings is to have 1 month of expenses as a basic emergency fund. After time, build that up to 6 months of expenses. This is better than nothing, but ideally this can serve as an “income replacement” fund in the event of losing your job. But if you have car repairs or things like that, it would be preferable to not have to pull from your e fund, so have a car expenses savings category as well. And then maybe a “new phone” category (not a “I want the newest phone as soon as it comes out” fund, but a “in the event that my phone craps out, I want to afford a new one in cash” fund). Same with a car fund. 

This is assuming you also simultaneously are investing and saving for retirement and all of that. 

Do you guys have those levels of redundancy? Or am I overthinking it?

I’m asking about this specifically on the context of financial independence. I feel like having multiple layers of savings can help with all the “unexpected” expenses that pop up, instead of depending on a catch all emergency fund, so you have more wiggle room",0.0,Neutral,English

Hi! My first reddit post.

I think my family is about 3.5 years out from leanish FI. 2 kids, ages 3 yrs and 10 mos, and one middle aged cat.

We're planning to move to a very LCOL area this winter and sell our current home in the spring. We expect to be able to buy a home for less than 100k (cash/loan from 401k which we would pay back as soon as current home sells). We also expect to net about 300k from the sale of current home (so 200k after paying ourselves back).

We expect another cash infusion of about 70k in the next year or two. Current pretax hh income is about 192k (we each make about the same) and we max retirement accounts. We started living very frugally a while back during some financial uncertainty and found we totally didn't mind shopping at aldi, eating lots of lentils, doing free/cheap things like hiking, camping, etc. We use prepaid cell phones, sling tv, use buy nothing, etc. but do like to go to sports events, outings with friends, etc.

2019 car will be paid off in January. We both work remote so income won't change until fall 2025 when I plan to step back from my roll to homeschool the kids (secular; I had a positive experience being homeschooled and graduated college at 19). Husband plans to work at least another 12-18 mos after that. 

We plan to start tracking/categorizing every expense starting tomorrow for at least 3 months to get an exact picture of our spending needs to not feel constrained.

Right now our investments are mostly in retirement account index funds with about 60k in after tax  index funds or roth iras. 

I know I want to read more about bonds and plan to have SOME funds in high yield savings accounts, bonds, etc. not just index funds before we both pull the trigger. We will need to convert 401k to roth and plan to do that while living off home sale gain.

Post FI we expect our pretax income to be in the 40k-60k range so we should qualify for highly subsidized medical insurance.

Both husband and I are open to consulting or other part time work (barista! I know i know) as needed, but we recognize it will likely be substantially harder to grow savings. We do both have some experience consulting.

Our #1 priority is having quality time to spend with our kids while they still like us (our son was born in 2020 so we estimate that window is closing in 2033 😂) and want to hang out with us. We'd rather leave our cushy jobs, have that time, and risk working shit jobs down the road... but of course best case would be the former without the latter. 

We do have about $30k in a 529 plan as well.

What else can/should we do to prepare? What am I forgetting? Tips to make our teens hate us slightly less when their first car is a beat up Honda instead of a tesla? 😉

We are budgeting for kids activities, extra medical costs like orthodontic work, etc.

Summary of nw/expected value for 2026 (optimistic except it assumes both spouses quit earning income cold turkey, which neither really plans to do):

100k - new house (paid in full)

270k - remaining anticipated cash increase from former house + windfall

580k - 2023 retirement account balance 

40k - 2023 post-tax savings + index funds

340k - rough estimate of new savings + investment growth by date both spouses stop working

1.23M investment total--> 50k annual withdrawal at 4%


How do we expect to jump down from 190k? We expect to drop:

50k+ currently routed to retirement/other savings

22k+ currently routed to mortgage 

30k+ currently routed to childcare 

20k+ in tax burden (lower income & tax bracket + lower tax rate in new city)

8k-28k Miscellaneous things like lower utility costs from being in a smaller house, lower cost of living, car payment being completed, spending less money on conveniences due to having more free time, etc.

2023-08-30,Achieved my first milestone: 0.5Cr,"Achieved my first milestone: 0.5Cr Hi,
I have been reading various posts in this sub and finally, a day has come for me to write something that even if inspires one person, I will be happy (PS: Post might be a bit lengthy). I finally hit my 5M(Rupees) net worth target.

I just turned 29 last month. After my Btech, I worked for two years where I didn't know much about investing and tax savings. All I did in those two years was save up money to spend on my master's (mtech) degree fees and expenditure. I graduated in 2020 from a good college and all the hard work to get a good company paid off. While doing my master's I started reading about finance stuff and I developed a huge interest in them. I was waiting for the opportunity to earn. I started my investing journey around 2018 and in two years I had just invested less than 10K in the market and I had 3.1k SIP (Yes, I still have that 100Rs SIP which I call it century fund) running from my mtech stipend. I just wanted to understand the market before investing anything (and ofc I was studying and had a money crunch to invest). With my masters, in parallel, I felt like I did my minors in finance as I was able to understand many stuff.

I restarted my professional life as an intern where I was able to save up to 20K per month. I increased my SIP amount to 8.1K from the previous 3.1K. The rest amount I started putting it in selected large-cap stocks which I felt were good. Although, in covid crash, I wanted to invest more, I again had minimum savings and I put in as much as possible. I started as an FTE in June 2020 after which my savings got increased and resulted in a positive net worth.

I also had a couple of checklists to finish before actively start investing a huge amount. So, I started doing it one by one:
 - Clear off the personal loan taken for the last semester of study (150K)
- Term insurance of 10M
- Medical insurance for my parents (in 2020, the premium paid was 40K which is now 50K for the third renewal)
- Health insurance for myself(still pending, the plan is to start with a very small amount as currently, I have it under employee benefit)
- Open ppf, nps accounts

I also developed a habit of tracking all my expenses and investments. I maintain a ledger to track all my stocks and mutual funds. I also have some targets to achieve considering future expenses (I know I can't predict but whatever I see the near future expense, I consider that).

My current monthly expenses are as follows:

- Rent and other flat (food, fun) expenses: 20K
- Car Loan: 16K
- Home Visit: 4-5K
- Parents: 10K
- Other Misc: 10K

I usually visit my hometown at least once in a month and have gifted Dad our first car in 2022. I know I bought it a little too early but it can never match anything as the memory created by the car in the last 1.5 years can't be expressed as Dad took Mom to various places and all I wanted was to show my mom the world other than my native. My parents' happiness always comes as my first priority in whatever financial planning I do.

My networth graph at the end of each year:

2019: -120K (negative due to personal loan for studies)

2020: 694K

2021: 2.11M

2022: 3.18M

2023 (Aug End): 5M

Major expenses in the year:

2021: Personal Loan taken for studies preclosure (100K+).

2022: Car loan of 800K taken (fixed interest at 7.25 hdfc bank), Home Renovation (500K)

Coming to present-day investing:

- 14.1K SIP in mutual funds (6K ELSS, 2K index, 6.1K in 3 mid/small cap funds)

- Invest anywhere between 0K to 50K in direct stocks(foreign or Indian)

Net worth Breakup:

Asset: 5.72M
Liabilities: 703K

Asset breakup: 

Land: 47% 

Equity Shares: 25% (in which foreign equity is 13%) 

Equity MF: 7.2%

PF/VPF: 8.8%

NPS: 3.4%

Company RSU: 5.3%

Gold: 1%

Crypto: 0.2%

Savings Bank: 0.1%

Liabilities:

Car Loan: 585K

Credit Card EMI: 73K (purchased a long pending MacBook on no cost EMI)

Credit Card others: 45K (usually this is <10K/month but last month I had to purchase a few items for my home)

As I recently purchased land which cost about 275K, I was saving up money for that in the last 1.5 years (we had a buy agreement for 11 months and just registered it last week). So, we see a high % allocation to land and very low cash holdings which is not at all good.

Future investing plan:

- No plans to allocate any more to land and the plan is to bring the percentage down to half in the next two years (yes 10M net worth target)
- Increase the cash holding (either Mom savings bank or debt mutual fund) so that I get the opportunity to invest whenever there is a huge fall and keep as emergency fund.
- Start investing 40-45K in gold starting from November as in Nov'2024 there is a plan to have my marriage which requires me to give at least 600-700K of gold (which should increase my gold holding to good 6-7% in next two years).
- Increase SIP amount from 14.1K to 18.1K as I’m not saving for land purchase anymore.

I was able to achieve this by consistently reading inspirational posts from here/other portals, tracking my expenses and investments, keeping a goal, and doing good in my work (doing a master's helped me a lot with a higher salary).

I plan to achieve the 10M target by the end of 2025 [Have been in the same company for 3.5years exponentially increasing the learning curve but now I think it is time to move closer to my native (Bengaluru) as I still feel underpaid for the experience and core tech Im working on and I plan to settle in Bengaluru](Two big expenses are on the way (mine and my brother marriage) which requires me to save at least 150-200K(excluding gold).

I wish to put my networth graph which is plotted for each month from 2020 but the sub doesn't allow me to post it.

# Net worth & portfolio

Current: 1.2 mln € (1.4 mln - 200k debt)

Progress: [https://imgur.com/a/YJ0TBEI](https://imgur.com/a/YJ0TBEI)

Portfolio split: [https://imgur.com/a/jVgCGIb](https://imgur.com/a/jVgCGIb)

# Context

32, worked since 24 (master) in technology sector. I've moved countries a couple of times which expains large changes in income streams. I didn't receive financial help from family or otherwise (except to study).

I've been pretty fortunate in life to get to this point and took some decisions which later turned out to be really lucrative.

# Income progression

*<year> - (<before taxes income> / <after taxes income>)*

**2013** \- (27000 eu / 20000 eu): graduated, started in my home country at a large consultancy firm. High tax country with 2100 eu/month. Really hated the job and athmosphere and left after 8 months.

**2014** \- (31000 eu / 23000 eu): joined a startup with a lot more ownership. Although the hours were rough (euro/hour worked was lower) it was way more fulfilling.

**2016** \- (64000 eu / 33000 eu): moved abroad to a large corporation abroad. Was lucky to be reached out to through linkedin (otherwise I'd likely have stayed in my home country).

**2018** \- (160.000 $ / 100.000 $): moved to the US for the same company. While I liked the experience the distance from home made it hard.

**2019** \- (160.000 € / 120.000 €): went back closer to home after managing a country which was both close enough and could provide the same or higher standard of living.

**today** \- (420.000 € / 300.000 €): stayed at the same company from 2019 and grew really fast due to a right mix of team and responsibilities.

There is still some upward trajectory possible but probably at the cost of free time. I'm not sure that trade is worth it.

# Target, plans & takeaways

* FIRE target is probably around the **4 mln €** mark which I can hopefully reach by 40 if the market allows it and my career growth continues.
* Always have been fully invested in **broad index fund stocks** with leftover cash. Mostly VTI and VXUS with about 5-10% spread over some bets to keep it interesting (have been investing for over 10 years).
* Bought a house 4 years ago in my home country which is rented out and appreciated by \~25%.
* Kept a lot of the company stock (50% of my stock portfolio) which I know is a risky move but has paid off in the last 4 years (other than 2022).
* Maxing out pension to reduce tax burden (which is anyway already very low at around 30%)
* Since I like what I do I don't plan to make big changes once I hit my target unless my sentiment changes by then.
* Plan to keep agressively investing in stocks given both the house and pension fund are safe(r) investments, my time horizon is long and my earning power is high.
* Diversify out of company stock. Since the value of the stock is also linked to my income the risk is bit too high for my tastes.
* Buy a primary residence with a maximal loan in case a low interest loan is still in the cards anytime soon.
* Realise that the current economy and job market might not be the same within 5 years.
* Maximize use of cheap money. My mortgage was at 1.1% so there is no incentive to pay this off.
* I've strongly prioritized friends and family time in the last couple of years. I'm at the age where time (grand)parents is limited.
* As signified on the chart money compounds pretty significantly. I probably celebrated my half mln mark just 2 years ago (obviously income helps). compounds pretty significantly. I probably celebrated my half mln mark just 2 years ago (obviously income helps).",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-08-03,Higher risk for possibly higher returns,"Higher risk for possibly higher returns If I want to risk it a bit, to be able to retire earlier, what's a good way to do it? 

Let's put the safest route to 60/40 global stocks and bonds. What's a bit riskier and possibly more profitable route? 

Some approaches I can think of:

    1. Lowering the bonds part to like 20 or even 0%
    2. Picking a smaller stock segment that you think might outperform. For example switching to only US stocks, large/small caps, or only emerging/developer markets etc.
    3. Using leverage. HELOC or LETFs.

    5. Going only with tech stocks like QQQ, FAANG or with a single stock that you've researched.

# Historical AGI

2016 - 27k: Internship 1 + being a TA at my university

2017 - 107k: Internship 2 + being a TA again. A lot of this is imputed income from getting corporate housing, which was valued at 6k a month which is insane and also part of my sign on bonus for the company. My offer was 110k base, 10% performance bonus, 160k stock vested over 4 years, and 90k signing bonus, 50k of which was paid up front.

2018 - 136k: Just graduated, started working in May

2019 - 172k: Received a refresher grant from my company for 24k vested over 4 years, base was bumped to 121k at the beginning of the year. Got promoted to E4 in the middle of the year, so my new base was 150k

2020 - 246k: Got a 98k refresher grant vested over 4 years. Base was bumped to 158k

2021 - 383k: Got promoted to E5. New base is 198k with a 15% bonus target. Got a refresher grant worth 190k

2022 - 370k: The reason why this number is down from last year is because of lousy market conditions means a lot of my RSU income went down. Base bumped to 215k with a 285k refresher grant.

2023 - Got a refresher for 329k. Got promoted to E6 so my new base is 248k with a bonus target of 20%. YTD pay is 270k

# Expenses

I don't currently have any debt. I was very fortunate that I was a CA resident so my college tuition was cheap and my family paid for it. My rent is currently 2k a month, and my credit card bill ordinarily hovers around $800-900 per month. I save a lot of money by having free food from my company and taking the shuttle to work. I have a 2008 Toyota Camry but try not to drive when possible. My hobbies are pretty low maintenance, like gaming, tennis, board games, hiking, etc.

# Asset Allocation

I kept it pretty simple. I maxed out my Backdoor Roth IRA and Mega backdoor roth 401k almost every year and max out my traditional 401k.

I am obviously not there yet so I do not have ""F You"" money. You can stop pointing it out.

I'm a 32 year old, single guy living in NYC and working as a software developer. I've realized that I've kinda been doing the bare minimum to keep my job and keep my boss happy. I get very good performance reviews at work, but I know I'm stagnating and coasting. I keep up with the industry somewhat, but mainly through reading silicon valley software dev twitter and stuff like that. I do little coding outside of work, but I'm a lead dev and do very little coding at work also (read a lot, write a little) which is a concern if I were to switch back to a heavy coding role.

It's hard to find the motivation to improve in my career when all I want to do is stop working as soon as possible. But I also know it's going to probably be a while longer before I can do that and continue to live comfortably.

My current financial picture is the following:

* Taxable investment account: $340k
* Tax advantaged retirement accounts: $220k
* Cash: $50k ($30k HYSA, $20k normal savings/checking at BoA)
* Debt: $0
* Income: $190k/year (my only source of income is from my employment)
* Total net worth: \~$600k

I max out my 401k and HSA and contribute an additional $1000/month to my taxable investment account. I also periodically dump extra into the investment account when I build up excess cash savings or get a bonus at work.

Living in Manhattan my expenses are obviously very high (rent alone is $3350/month), but it's the price I pay to live in the city I love...for now. Being single is also a big part of why I live here, if I'm being frank. While I do want to continue living here for a while longer (even if I find a long-term partner) I do see myself moving out of the city in the next \~5ish years and ideally settling down somewhere fairly rural (been really interested in the homesteading idea, maybe not full homestead but I want to live somewhere where I can have a good amount of land and a simple life).

I don't have much direction in life at the moment but I am enjoying myself. I have a fun social life and hobbies and can certainly keep myself entertained without a job. In fact, I tend to slack off a lot of my days and watch Youtube when I should be working.

With a N/W of $600k I feel comfortable, but that comfort is having the detrimental affect of making me not really care about my career.

I guess I'm just looking for any advice. I know I shared a lot here and maybe this is a conversation better suited for a therapy session (I've never been to therapy) but figured I'd see if anyone here could relate or provide some insight since this has been a very helpful community for me in the past.

2023-07-22,Feeling Lost Post-FIRE,"Feeling Lost Post-FIRE I'm living the thing people speculate about.

I've been FIREd for over 5 years now. I got very lucky, and made smart choices, and went from $-40k to $750k from 22 to 29, FIREd, and continued to have good luck/choices that have put me at 1.3MM and growing. During these 5 years I've lived in a van, thru hiked 4000 miles, started a successful small biz that is now 90% passive, made art, partied, dated, gone to lots of therapy, gotten super fit, spent 30+ days in silent meditation retreats, gotten closer to my family... etc. It's been a dream, and also, sometimes, a nightmare.

I don't want kids, I'm averse to going back to work for someone else (esp full time), and my small biz is old news and boring. I've been hitting the mental health/personal development game HARD for 5 years and gotten a lot of progress but fuck, I'm sick of it, working so hard on myself and still struggling, and feeling plateaued with a lot of issues still unresolved (thank you, fucked up childhood). Going on long adventures in my van or backpacking is a super fun diversion, but feels like just that.. escapism, not building community or a future or contributing to anything. I'm too lazy and ADHD to start a homestead and already struggle to keep up the yard and home maintenance on my dope house.

I know how awful the grind is and feel so much compassion for everyone struggling in the system. It's a relief to feel financially secure and I've gained a lot of mental health just from this safety and security and being able to help others with my time and money. Yet, I find myself weirdly envying people who need to work to pay their bills... because they're forced into having purpose. They have to wake up and hustle, they *have* to do that. I don't have to wake up and do shit! And a lot of days, I don't. I spend too much time on my phone, and too much time not knowing what to do with myself. The lack of structure seems to really be getting me down in the last year or so. Instead of making art, renovating my van, or working on my overgrown yard, I lay in bed on Reddit and feel like I'm wasting my life.

Yes I'm in therapy (and more recently, on medication), but they don't really seem to have a toolkit for this. These are the big questions: ""What am I doing with my life?"" and I have yet to find a therapist who knows how to touch that in any meaningful way (finding a really good therapist is the hardest shit, y'all).

I visited with a friend yesterday, who is helping manage the care for her partner's dad, who inherited a bunch of money in his 40s and whose life has completely gone off the rails since then. He doesn't need to work and doesn't know what to do with his life and is one mental health crisis after another (he also came from a traumatic childhood), and has tried every kind of therapy imaginable. I felt this sad sense of empathy for the guy.

This isn't meant to be a cautionary tale, just my story. If you want to give advice or empathy, I'm listening (just don't tell me to go to therapy, ffs). I'm just wondering, at this point, if FIRE is best suited for those with stable mental health and a healthy self-motivation and ability to thrive without structure. At this point, I have no idea how to strive for optimal happiness.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-07-19,$100 to $100k in the US Navy,"$100 to $100k in the US Navy I graduated high school in June of 2018 and shipped off to boot camp that July with nothing but $129.10 in my bank account. I now sit at $107,349.62 invested 5 years later at 23 years old.

* Roth IRA: $19,179.79

* Brokerage: $15,635.83

* I Bonds: $11,565.60

* Crypto: $525.07

**Origin story:**

I never really worried about money for the majority of my life. My parents are both immigrants from a Third World country and they gave me the best life they could while I was growing up. Before I even started kindergarten we moved out of the somewhat dangerous city to a nicer neighborhood in the suburbs. I got everything I needed for school and was never hungry or anything, but I slowly did start to notice that I didn't have nearly as many ""cool"" things as the other kids. It never bothered me, but it was just something I had observed growing up. My summer going into senior year I got my first job at 17 years old. My brother worked at Starbucks and the manager liked him so she asked if he had any siblings. I hated asking my parents for money. But being a 17 year old going into his last year of high school, I absolutely needed money to do shit with my friends and buy computer parts. So I thought to myself, ""why not?"" There wasn't even an interview or anything, I just told my brother yes, the manager texted me to show up one day, and then suddenly I was an employed member of society. So I worked there for the summer and I finally had my own money. I'll never forget getting a check for a couple hundred bucks and thinking to myself, ""holy shit I'm fucking rich now.""

Summer ends and my senior year starts so I shift my hours to weekends only. At this time I am absolutely, 100%, dead set on college. There was never even a question about whether I was going or not my entire career as a student. I've always had good grades and I always knew exactly what I wanted to do. Being a computer geek I knew that computer science would absolutely be the move to make a shit ton of money doing something that I enjoyed. The military never even crossed my mind. That shit is only for idiots who can't get into college and I am way too smart for that. At the time my mother had not been working for a year or two because she had gone through depression. Tragedies within the family occurred and her job was too stressful so she had to quit in order to save herself. My dad had to pick up the slack financially by doing side hustles along with his main job working Monday to Friday (half days on Saturday) AND also trying his absolute hardest to help my mom out of her slump. I honestly can't imagine how tough that time was for him. He’s a fucking hero. I was just a kid at the time and I had honestly no idea what was happening. All I knew was that my mom was sad but other than that, nothing else changed and my future was probably fine. Thankfully my mom beat the depression and she's been okay ever since. She didn't go back to her old job because she was getting old, it was too stressful, and she was still enjoying not working (I now understand). But during that time I slowly started to realize that the financial situation within our household may not be as good I had always thought. My parents have never ever said that they were hurting for money (immigrant parent pride) and even during the dark times of my mom's depression, not once did either of them say a word. My dad quitting his job is what finally convinced me that we were, in fact, kind of poor. I know I say that both my parents quit their jobs, but I just want to point out that they had also been working at their companies for minimum 20 years each. After 5 years in the Navy I completely understand. I also said kind of poor, but I really meant living paycheck to paycheck. So basically early on senior year both my parents were unemployed and my older brother was already attending college on student loans. I started doing the math inside my head, ""okay house mortgage + one college tuition + no jobs = holy shit..... I don't think I can go to college.""

There had to be something else for me to do. My main goal was to completely remove the financial burden of my existence to help them out. After doing research, I discovered that the military is completely free (monetarily speaking, you sell your soul) and they also pay you. It was a win-win in my book. I was 100% set on the Air Force or Navy because there's no way I was going to combat and both branches have jobs for nerds like me. Thankfully, my high school happened to be administering the ASVAB (the standardized test you need to take to enlist into any branch of the military, it's like any standardized test with math, science, English and shit) one Saturday morning so I said fuck it and took it. Before I even saw my own results a Navy recruiter was blowing up my phone wanting to see me because I got a decent enough score. Once he had successfully lied to me about basically everything, I was convinced. Before Christmas of that year I had signed my life away for 6 years to do something that I had virtually no knowledge about. All I knew was that my parents wouldn't have to pay a single dime and I would actually be making money. I rode out the rest of my senior year, enjoyed my one month of summer vacation, and shipped off.

**$100 to $100k:**

My first almost 2 years in the Navy I was basically just putting money away in my savings and not spending that much. The only bills I had were the phone bill and the TV/internet bill for back home. The Navy paid for basically everything for me so pretty much my entire check was pocket money. I've always been pretty frugal so I never bought the Camaro or married a stripper (I fight the urges every day) and decided to just save. I wasn't investing in anything except TSP (military/government 401K) at 5%. The only reason I did that was because I was told if I did anything less than 5%, I would be giving up free money because they’ll match it. I didn’t even really know anything about it or retirement in general, but who would ever give up free money? After about 8 months in the Navy in March 2019 I found Ally Bank and started putting my money there because the interest rate was way higher than a normal savings account, which I guess was my first step to finding FI. After about 1.5 years in February 2020 I discovered this sub and /r/militaryfinance. That's when I started putting the max percentage of my pay (60% of my base pay which was not enough to max it out as a lowly E-4) into TSP. After a little more research, I discovered that the money in my savings account could be put into this thing called a Roth IRA and VTSAX and that Vanguard was the cool site to do it on. So in June 2020 I managed to slip in $6,000 for the 2019 tax year because it had gotten changed so many times due to COVID. This actually enabled me to put in another $6,000 in September for the 2020 tax year. Ever since then I've been slowing contributing.

2020 and 2021 were amazing years and I loved watching the numbers go up quickly and all the green. End of 2021 and almost all 2022, not so much. I remember that’s when I stopped opening up my TSP or Vanguard regularly because I hated seeing all the red, but I still contributed here and there. I also opened up a regular brokerage towards the end of 2021 because I figured that one day I might need money that I can access quickly. I also very recently discovered I Bonds and now plan on putting more money into that and basically using it as my emergency savings account. I have things planned in the next ~3 years when I eventually separate from the Navy where that money might come into play. Anyways, I somehow managed to be at over $100,000 and the funny part is I think I might have passed it maybe a month ago. I just never checked. Actually the only reason I decided to finally add up my numbers was because of the guy who posted yesterday about being 23 years old with $100,000. I thought, “fuck man he’s way ahead of me I need to see how far off I am.” To my greatest surprise, we're both in the same boat (get it?!?!).

**Lost potential:**

The craziest part about all of this is that I could have had even MORE if I kept aggressively investing into my TSP and Roth IRA. I actually dialed back my investments towards the end of 2021 because we were finally not on deployment and COVID restrictions were finally relaxing. I actually could use my money to you know... live. 2020 and 2021 I was on deployment half of those years not spending money and the other half I was stuck inside not spending any money because of COVID restrictions. So I basically had nothing to do but invest my money or else it would have just sat there. From the end of 2021 to the present day I've spent much more time on land than at sea and I've been enjoying my time living in Japan and spending my money. But I'm extremely happy exactly where I'm at right now and the money I have invested into fun was absolutely well spent... for the most part. If I were to nitpick I could definitely have saved some extra money at some points and put it into the market but fuck it, I've got to live at some point in my 20s. 

**Thanks to everyone here:**

I mostly lurk here and never comment or post because I don’t really think I have anything to contribute that hasn’t already been said. But I hope that being an enlisted guy (officers in the military make a bajillion more for virtually no reason except having a degree) that joined with basically nothing at 18 will be interesting to some of y’all. The daily threads get me through deployments and it’s always a pleasure reading about everyone’s financial lives and just regular lives. There’s just barrrrrrrrely enough internet to load old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence. I remember laughing at one of the comments on one of the daily threads while on deployment talking about telling your boss that you aren’t showing up instead of asking. They would legitimately cut my balls off, make me walk the plank, then put me back to work if I didn’t show up without approved PTO. But anyways if y’all have any suggestions for me in the short term or long term feel free to let me know. Also if y’all have any questions about anything feel free to ask.",0.0,Neutral,English

2023-07-11,Options for exiting the rate race,"Options for exiting the rate race I'm 37M living in VHCOL. I've been working basically non-stop since I was 14 years old when not studying. I've always been financially responsible but have really gotten into the FIRE movement ever since the pandemic.

Here is my net worth over time:

https://ibb.co/dkCjM2K

Net worth is around $3M with this breakdown:

$1.4M: Taxable Individual big tech stocks

$800K: Taxable Index funds

$600K: 401K

$200K: Home equity

Current annual expenses is around $100K, but I'm expecting to get married and have a kid in next 4 years. My best guess is I need a $4M portfolio for the future expense. Fortunately, my partner is just starting her career and looking at $200K income if working full time. But I don't want to rely on her income. My current income is $700K. I know many people will read this and roll their eyes, but hear me out.

I've been feeling very burned out and disillusioned with the corporate America culture and rate race. The pandemic and WFH was a significant contributor to this burn out. I've seeked help and read the latest research on the topic of burnout and the consensus is that the only solution is permanently removing yourself from the environment causing burn out. Even after recovering from burn out, my values have fundamentally changed in recent years, and I now value freedom (doing what I want when I want) more than anything else (consumerism, material possession, etc.)

I see a fork in the road:

a) Retire now, move to a lower cost of living location. This would be the Moustachian move.

b) Suck it up for a couple of years more and hit the FIRE number for current location.

c) Quit the current job. Recover from the burnout and look for another job in 6 months to a year. Risk with this option is there's a high chance I will love not working and it'd suck to go back to work once I tasted the freedom.

I'm looking for feedback on the numbers as well as any advice from folks in similar situations.Thanks!",0.0,Neutral,English

2023-06-16,29M in VHCOL with 260k NW as mechanical engineer,"29M in VHCOL with 260k NW as mechanical engineer Long post incoming - wanted to share my journey of a little over 5 years of full time work. I found this community early into my first year of work and its been incredible seeing people's stories and I figured there might be someone who might take something out of my kinda mid career-ish experience as well.

**Background:**

Fortunate to have grown up in a middle class household and wanted to pursue engineering in college. Unlike most people in here who seem into software, I just couldn't get around looking at that much code on-screen and took up mechanical engineering with the expectation that I'd get to work on more tangible stuff. Little did I know I would end up looking at screens for much of the workday anyway (CAD, meetings, slide prep, sigh)!

Was privileged enough that parents paid my way through undergrad (cheaper state school so around $40k for tuition + expenses) but then went on to grad school immediately after. Parents did give me a boost (around $25k) and I paid for some of it through work around campus plus summer internship money, but took on student loans for the rest ($42k - yeah still unsure if the private grad school was worth it but its done with).

Graduated in the fall of 2017 and found a job pretty last minute in Energy (Oil and Gas) in Texas. It paid about $83k/year and so of course I then immediately went and financed a newish car for $23k (atleast it was a Honda that has been a workhorse so far and well into the next decade hopefully). So about $65k in the red to start and it definitely felt a little suffocating. This was about when I discovered MMM and decided to aim to get outta debt by the end of the next year (2019) with no idea if it was realistic. Fortunately for me, Texas was pretty cheap and I was used to multiple roommates in college, so having a 1 bedroom apartment all to myself felt pretty luxurious. Those first couple years I didn't really spend too much, mostly cooked at home, went out on the weekends as I was making new friends and maybe had a couple small vacations (camping, solo travel to Central America with hostels, etc). I probably averaged spending around $28k each year and managed to clear student loans in December 2019 and paid off my car in Feb 2020. Missed my admittedly completely arbitrary goal by a couple months but it sure felt great to not have any debt weighing on me. 
NW EOY 2019 ~ $25k (mostly all 401k)

Started investing in the brokerage early 2020 and had little invested so the March ‘20 dip didn't really put me off too much. I had been investing in the company 401k up to employer match (6%) but now decided to max it out with the additional cashflow available.

Much of 2020 and 2021 was uneventful, spent it mostly getting in and staying out of relationships (not by choice ah...) and feeling thankful that I wasn't involved as the company went through layoffs. Kept spending as I had before, hobbies were usually getting free library books on the kindle, running and playing sports and hanging out with friends. Travel was tough those years but did do trips out to visit friends cross-country for a couple weeks where we would mostly do outdoor stuff like hikes and camping and eat good food. By the end of 2021 NW was about $150k, I was averaging about $50k total in savings those years and got a couple promotions at work so was making about $100k income.

Felt it was time for a change as the market was booming along with the labor market and decided to apply and interview for roles in early 2022. Was fortunate to get a call back from FAANG and decided that this was going to be my all-or-nothing chance (not really, but its good to get hyped up haha) to take a step up. Got through their interviews and finally moved to sunny California for the new job mid-2022. 

Can't say I really miss Texas (apart from my $1k rent and $2/gallon gas that has easily doubled) as there is so much more to do in California - weather is perfect to be outdoors and there is actual geography to traverse. Plus the options to be able to go to the beach or ski or head to major cities within a couple hours drive seems like a great quality of life improvement. I think the step up in income counters the VHCOL as well as the additional state taxes as I'm able to net save more overall. Trying to keep most of my lifestyle unchanged although I did get some new Jordans, re-decorate my apartment rather fancily (thanks r/malelivingspace) and plan to travel more this year (taking the fam to Hawaii lets gooo).

**Income:**

2018: $83k

**Annual Savings ~$80k**

401k: $27k

RSU/ESPP: $22k

Taxable brokerage: $18k

Backdoor Roth: $6.5k

HYSA: $6k

Feeling pretty grateful to be in this position and excited about what comes ahead. Planning to keep chugging along and seeing how life treats me in the next couple years, most of my monthly surplus is just auto-invested in index funds. Long term FIRE goal is to retire with ~$2M in investments by 45 as I’m expecting expenses to double with a family but I’m sure there’s a whole lot of life in the way!

Been thinking about keeping my company stock as is along with all additional RSUs/ESPP as I'm low-key trying to bet on the company doing well in the future. It's still a small % of NW for now - I feel like I have enough of a diversified base and am DCAing enough into index funds that it's worth risking this concentration for potential upside. Definitely don’t have any inside scoop and this may well end up being just lazy and bite me in the rear but I’m okay with the risk. FAANG is definitely a lot more hours and stress and my work life balance is not as good but there is also that potential to really supercharge both your career ambitions and finances if you do well. I figure I'm kinda young and full of energy with limited responsibilities to give the career a good crack over the next few years and see how it turns out. Also been slowly adding to my cash position as a downpayment even though I'm not fully sold on buying a place in this market but who needs to buy a house anyways, thanks California :p.

2023-06-16,"I lived in poverty for 18 years. Finally reached ""Poverty FI"" today.","I lived in poverty for 18 years. Finally reached ""Poverty FI"" today. I grew up in a privileged but dysfunctional family, and left home after high school to seek my own way. I traveled, picking up odd jobs here and there to pay for food and train/bus tickets. Sometimes I'd sleep in hostels, sometimes I'd make friends with new folks who would offer me a place to stay, sometimes I camped, sometimes I lived in group houses rent-free as long as I did all the chores. For many years I worked on farms, which offered me both work and a place to sleep and food to eat. 

In the early years of apprenticeship my stipend was only $400 a month. The most I ever made during those 18 years was $17 an hour. Looking back through tax returns, my AGI varied from about $4000 - $14,000. My expenses also varied but tended to be around $1000-1200 a month during the later years. For reference, the Federal Poverty Limit at that time was around $10-12,000.

Eventually I got to where I was running my own small farm on rented land, but after doing the accounting one winter I realized I was losing money and needed to make a serious life change. It was around then that I discovered this subreddit and it changed my life. It gave me hope for a future where I wouldn't have crippling financial anxiety if I got injured and couldn't work anymore (which happened a couple times).

Up until that point most advice I'd ever heard regarding increasing savings was about reducing expenses. Well, that rings pretty hollow for someone who is growing their own food, has a truck old enough to qualify for a historic vehicle license plate, is using a $13/mo phone plan, and almost never spends a cent on going out/entertainment. Increasing income was the only path forward, and it was clear I'd never be able to do it farming.

I spent that year studying computer programming, using MOOCs and books from the library. I started applying to jobs but had a hard time breaking in, as employers wanted real-world industry experience. Finally with some resume tweaks I got a lucky break. 

After 4 years, I now have enough in my portfolio that, using the 4% rule, it would sustain me if I returned to my previous lifestyle of poverty. This is a huge milestone for me, and I feel an incredible weight lifted off my shoulders. That no matter what happens, financially I will be ""not bankrupt"" going forward, with some life adjustments. Having spent so many years worrying that I might completely run out of money, I can't fully express how significant this feels.

Currently I rent a studio apartment in a HCOL city, so if I were to remain here, I would not be FI for some more years yet. I plan to keep working for at least 5-6 more years, and will reassess then whether to retire. 

But I remember those days 5 years ago when I dreamed of being able to live indefinitely on the money I had, without having to wake up at 3am to harvest lettuce, working myself so hard that my body became as thin as the people you see in pictures from war-torn countries.

That is the power of financial independence.",0.0,Neutral,English

2023-06-06,Figuring out what stocks I own,"Figuring out what stocks I own I almost exclusively invest in mutual funds and ETFs, I own only 2 individual stocks. I have a little extra money and I am struggling to determine where to it. The easy answer has always been to just put it in VTSAX or some S&P500 fund, however I started thinking about how those funds potentially have a lot of overlap in individual stocks, and how I might be over-weight in a small handful of individual companies, i.e. mostly the FAANG stocks. At this point right now I know exactly how much money I have in each mutual fund/ETF across my brokerage account, Roth IRA, HSA, and 401k, but I have no idea how much of each individual stock I own that is buried within those funds and ETFs. 

Do any of you know of a clever way of getting an xls list of each fund/ETF with the individual stocks and percent weight within the fund? Well, other than the obvious brute force method of manually looking each one up and copy/pasting it into a spreadsheet. I realize this is probably a worthless exercise, but I'm a data dork and now I just want to know what I actually own.

2023-06-04,"Journey to FIRE: First year out, laying the foundation for the future! Year 1 UPDATE","Journey to FIRE: First year out, laying the foundation for the future! Year 1 UPDATE Hey everyone, this is an update to my first post that I posted exactly 1 year ago about my plan to achieve FIRE and my financial goals. Any suggestions or criticism is welcome. 

Another year has passed and I am a year older and (hopefully) wiser than my 22yo self. Looking back on the post a lot of the things I said were just not the way to do things, I will go over this later.

[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/v2rska/journey_to_fire_im_going_to_be_a_millionaire_year/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I (M23) can’t believe it’s been a year since I made that and damn have a lot of things happened in just one year. I have not strayed too terribly far off the path I set for myself in last years post, but there have been some major changes. I will go over the previous goals I set for myself vs what actually happened, as well as my goals for next year. Let’s get to it…

In last year’s post I made the following points/goals that I hoped to achieve this past year, these were:

-Split savings between HYSA for downpayment and investment accounts

-Save up downpayment for a house

-Create emergency fund

The House:

So, I actually closed on a house in January 2022 after new years so I guess you could say I successfully saved up a downpayment lol.

I originally planned on staying with my parents for a few years… but it didn’t really work out as I had planned. At the time I was also living there with my girlfriend (F32) but we were quickly outgrowing the small bedroom that we had, as well as having other family issues. This wasn’t a sudden issue but had been brewing for quite some time, nothing bad but it’s just sometimes hard to live with your family in a cramped apartment.

I used an FHA loan to take advantage of the 3.5% downpayment. I was also able to negotiate the price down quite a bit as well as get maximum seller concessions + cash back at closing. Overall after taking cash back into consideration I only needed to bring ~13k to close on it, which felt insane. Could I have put down more than 3.5%? I could have but I didn’t. Would rather keep more cash on hand for the other goals. 

My interest rate is… not good. 6.6% but it was the best that I could get (781 credit score) and now I’m glad I did as rates are now 7%+.

My rationale was, I might as well lock in a rate now. If rates go up, I got a good rate. If rates go down, I can always refinance later. Also, budgeting will be easier year to year as my housing will be (mostly) the same without any dramatic increases like if I were to rent.

I inherited my tenant and moved into the vacant side where I now currently live. He is a long term tenant. The rent is below market value HOWEVER, I seem to have inherited a golden tenant. He always pays on time or early, doesn’t cause any issues or break anything. His unit is also well maintained and in good condition. I don’t plan on raising rent much because of this.

Emergency Fund:

I have successfully managed to save up roughly a years worth of expenses in a high yield savings account @4.55% interest rate. The account totals a bit over 20k. 

This amount will allow me to afford the necessities for a year in an absolute catastrophic scenario that will most likely never happen. Essentially if me and my girlfriend had no job or income for an entire year AND my tenant decided to stop paying rent for a year. All of these will pretty much never happen all at once but it also gives me wiggle room for repairs or anything like that. 

Investments:

I currently have an investment account with a bit over 11k in it. Had to rebuild this from scratch as I had to pull out a lot of it for the purchase of my house (stupid I know) I know now I should not have used an investment account as a savings account for the downpayment.

I am currently invested in a mix of roughly 75% VOO and 25% SCHD to capture growth as well as some dividend growth. 

What I learned: 

I have learned a ton in this past year, not specifically to help with FIRE but life in general as well and how to “adult” lmao.

I have learned how to be a landlord. Only to one tenant but I feel like I have the basics down now. I know how the paperwork for leases work now and how to do general maintenance, and make improvements to a property. I have done painting, basic plumbing, some carpentry, etc. that I otherwise wouldn’t have learned or been exposed to if I didn’t buy a house. YouTube really helps lol.

I have been at my current first job for about a year now and I really enjoy it! I have gotten a raise as well which is nice and I can do my job competently without any issues. Some days are bad but there’s more good days than bad days. I have been taught all the necessary skills that I need to know for my job and to advance my career. I feel that the hardest part is over now that I can do my job without thinking too hard about it often.

Goals for next year:

I need to finish school as fast as possible. I only have my associates degree so I am currently in school for my bachelors, I only have 2 classes left so I should be finishing them soon. I am looking forward to being done with school forever as I will have more free time to pick up extra shifts and make improvements to the house. Because I have been in school since September of last year, I have not been able to pick up many extra shifts to make more money.

I am planning on funneling all of my leftover income into my investment account as I now have a big enough emergency fund that is growing a bit every month. I would love to maybe hit the six figure threshold by this time next year… who knows? It may be possible.

Develop skills and become better at my job to further advance my career and make more. I have only a year experience under my belt and still learn new things everyday. I would like to work maybe another year in my current position before I start looking elsewhere. I have dabbled with the thought of doing some contract work on the side with other companies while still working my current job, but it would be impossible time wise since I’m still in school. Maybe when I finish soon.

This focus on increasing income is necessary as a budget and living frugally can only get me so far so fast. I was chatting with a friend at work one day a couple months ago and we were discussing living frugally to increase savings rate. He told me while it is very helpful to live frugally and save where you can, I’m not going to save my way to FIRE alone, I have to maximize my income in combination with saving to reach it. It may seem obvious but it didn’t really quite hit me until then.

I believe I have a good foundation built now. I have a good job, a house, a car, a loving girlfriend and live within my means. I just need to finish school and earn more this next year. I am in no rush to buy real estate unless the perfect property pops up. Life sucks sometimes but is overall pretty good. 

Any suggestions are welcome! I will update this again in another year!",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-06-01,[Update] $1M the boring way,"[Update] $1M the boring way This is possibly the final update to my series of previous posts, [""$500k the boring way""](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k8it0c/update_500k_the_boring_way/), [“$250k the boring way”](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c4ppcl/update_250k_the_boring_way/), and my original post, [""$100k the boring way""](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6tuhr2/100k_the_boring_way/). Those older posts have all the details but I will attempt to summarize. Also I just wanted to say that I really wanted to make the title ""$1000K the boring way"" but didn't have enough confidence.

#Summary

Reached $1M net worth from a starting point less than -$100k in roughly 11 years, mostly through consistent saving. Net worth chart included below. All salary numbers are gross.

#Quick^(ish) Recap

My wife and I are both 34 and live in the Pacific Northwest. We met when we were 24 and I estimate at the time that we had a combined net worth of close to -$120k. I’m an engineer (EE) and my wife is a public school employee.

On our journey to $500k net worth we:

- Both got graduate degrees.
- Found new jobs and moved from Midwest to PNW to be closer to family.
- Progressed our careers and salaries: $67k to $126k for me and $54k to $90k back down to $70k (part time) for my wife.
- Bought a house and refi'd it twice.
- Received $18k of student loan forgiveness.
- Had two babies.

#Updates

It's been a while since my last post - it was definitely weird going back and reading through these previous snapshots of our life. The $500k update was posted in Dec 2020 and even though the pandy had been going on for a bit, (as we all know) we were in for a much longer ride than anticipated.

&nbsp;

**2021:** I think it's telling that I had a lot of trouble trying to remember things that happened this year. I hate to call it a lost year because I'm extremely grateful for the extra time I got to spend with my young kids - we really just didn't do much due to having said young kids and an abundance of caution. I went through my phone photo highlights from 2021 to try and jog my memory and they all were geotagged at our house or a nearby town. 

I actually found this pretty interesting from a financial perspective - on one hand, sure, there were less opportunities for spending on things like restaurants and social activities, and in the comments of my last update I had noted that our cash had built up really quickly basically on accident. On the other hand, the unknowns and challenges surrounding the pandemic and parenting really shifted my mindset around spending. I found it much easier to justify all types of purchases and spending because ""well, whatever it takes to get us through this"". I wouldn't say we went overboard or anything like that, more like we accepted a healthy amount of lifestyle creep into our lives. We bought the ridiculous inflatable kiddie pool (no it didn't last long), we started adding more ""fun"" stuff to our cart at the grocery, paid for little subscription services here and there, etc. For my own mental health, I basically completely stopped tracking spending, stocks, our accounts, bills, and most things finance-related (including this sub^(I'm so sorry)). Ultimately I think doing less during the pandemic plus our increased spending was more or less a wash financially.

At work, I officially maxed out on my salary band, so effectively I didn't get a raise. I'm pretty sure the COLA was also nonexistent this year which they blamed on Covid. I got to work 100% remote with no pressure to bring people back, which I really appreciated. With working a bunch of on-call nights and weekends I ended up at $136k for the year. My wife completed her first full year of part-time work which dropped her from $90k to $60k

We did end up buying a new car shortly after my last post in Dec 2020. Went with a Subaru Ascent (sorry to all the minivan fans from the previous comment section) and it turned out to be really lucky timing because we got it for insanely cheap and 0% interest and then the car market went crazy. 

Our youngest joined our oldest at daycare in the fall for a total of $2,150/mo. 

&nbsp;

**2022:** At my job, I was feeling kind of stuck. At this point I had found that some side projects that I took on for ""fun"" (I did have a genuine interest/passion) had become basically additional full-time positions. I was getting a ton of recognition and accolades for the work I was doing, but no promotion or raise. The culture at my workplace was to protect/gatekeep the top engineering title at all costs, so my successes were constantly met with ""you're doing great, just be patient"" or ""the optics might not look good to the other engineering departments"" or various other BS. Ultimately, it made me start to resent my job that I really loved. I let my supervisor know early in the year that my patience was running low and eventually I would be forced to look elsewhere, which he understood.

On one frustrating day in the fall I decided to just have a quick look at the other similar companies in my area and happened upon a job posting that was kind of my dream role (essentially getting to do some of the extra work I had taken on as my full time job and drop the day-to-day stuff). It all happened very quickly after that: I got a call the morning after submitting my resume, then a week later I got a job offer 20 minutes after my interview had concluded. I asked for as much time to decide as possible, gave the offer to my current employer, and they made me wait a long time before coming back and saying they wanted to but couldn't match right now. So I left ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ There's a ton more to say on this topic but probably too much for this post as it is so happy to continue down in the comments if people want. The CEO ended up requesting to do a personal exit interview with me, so that was cool.

Otherwise, 2022 was pretty uneventful financially. Obviously the market was down so not a lot of action or visible progress in our net worth journey. Was one of the first ""extended"" downturn-type period of time I've experienced in the market. I didn't change anything.

We took a much needed family vacay south of the border. Daycare raised prices by a reasonable 5% to $2,250/mo.

&nbsp;

**2023:** I started my new job in late Jan, going from $135k total comp to $160k plus a $12k signing bonus and I no longer have to be on-call overnight. I *heavily* engineered my start date to make sure I was still able to receive a one-time payout my old employer did at the beginning of the year to make up for freezing the salary schedule during Covid. I also had something ridiculous like 700 hours of PTO paid out (RIP my taxes this year). 
>Side note: I do not recommend saving up as much PTO as I did, go live your life. I was saving aggressively to prep for us having kids, and then the pandemic happened so barely used any for a couple years. Happy accident that my banked PTO ended up getting much more valueable over the years as my salary was increasing rapidly.

Our house is great but as the kids are growing we are thinking it would be nice to have some extra space. We've talked to our realtor and lender to get the process moving but not in any specific rush. We will have to do some upgrades to the house like exterior paint, possibly the roof, deck upgrade (finished ourselves) but those are needed either way so just going to do them in case we decide to enter the market. The idea of getting a new mortgage right now seems so wild to me, but I know you can't time these things. It definitely would hurt to go from 2.875% to 7%. I'm considering exploring just adding on to our current house, but not sure if that's really feasible at this point.

Daycare is now $2,900/mo lol (this is even with our costs going down slightly as our son has aged into the older classroom). It was actually hilarious to me that they sent out a ""We won best daycare in the region"" announcement followed very shortly by a 30% price increase. It is what it is though - I think this is pretty solidly reasonable for the area.

We took a family trip to Disneyland a couple days before our son turned 3 so that his park entry would still be free. My mindset going into trip planning was ""Disney is expensive, so if you want to go, just accept that"". We used a few different little tips and tricks for saving money here and there but overall tried not to worry too much about complete optimization. With that attitude we had a great trip and to me at least the memories and moments with my kids were totally worth it. Do the princess breakfast.

#Chart

[Here is our entire financial journey summed up in one line.](https://imgur.com/a/2MqEcTG) Apparently they don't do the thing anymore where it changes color when crossing over from negative to positive, that's a bummer (the first line on the y-axis is $0, not the x-axis). I really thought it would look like more of an exponential curve by now. There aren't really inflection points anymore besides the Covid 2020 drop, when the app would get confused, or accounts would stop updating from time to time, so here are the relevant dates in list form:

- 7/2/15 began tracking net worth.
- 3/29/16 crossed $0! We are worthless!
- 5/24/17 crossed $100k net worth.
- 8/10/18 crossed $200k net worth.
- 6/11/19 crossed $300k net worth.
- 1/17/20 crossed $400k net worth.
- 8/25/20 crossed $500k net worth.
- 12/3/20 crossed $600k net worth.
- 4/7/21 crossed $700k net worth.
- 8/27/21 crossed $800k net worth.
- 3/26/22 crossed $900k net worth.
- 5/1/23 crossed **$1M** net worth.

I enjoyed watching the time between milestones get shorter and shorter, and then 2022 happened.

#Current Finances

- $100k in cash as an e-fund/new house downpayment savings, $6k in an HSA.
- $550k of investments, mostly lazy index 3-fund portfolio.
- $370k equity in our home
- -$10k of student loans remaining

Our savings rate was 40% from 45% one baby and 55% no babies. Now? I have absolutely no idea. Past me and part of current me thinks that's both hilarious and terrifying - who even am I?? I believe it's likely around the 40% mark still. I think part of me doesn't want to figure it out because it might be lower than I was hoping for and stress me out unnecessarily. 

#Now what

I told my wife the news that we were officially millionaires (that sounds so stupid typing it out) a few days ago and she asked ""what does that mean"". I said ""literally nothing, lol"". We are definitively in the ""boring middle"" phase of retirement savings, and so I don't expect any substantial changes. 

When is enough, enough? I really don't know. I still want to retire early, but as I've grown into my career (and very much^(mostly) enjoyed the work) I've found myself less eager to leave. I think working from home has had a huge impact on this. It's probably time for a sit down with my wife to talk about our next 5-10 years and maybe map out a number that we would feel comfortable with. 

It's for sure time to update the budget soon and get that back on track. My oldest will attend kindergarten in the fall, so that will be nice to cut our daycare bill in half. We may never see that money if it ends up going towards a larger mortgage, but I need to get an updated picture of our finances before we can figure out exactly what sort of house we want to afford.

Our student loans are what initially set me down this path of aggressively saving and investing. I find it kind of funny that despite all of our financial accomplishments, we still have not officially paid off our student loans. I'm holding out hope for the student loan bill to go through, so until there is interest being charged again, the last $10k will just sit there.

Not that I think anyone would remember this, but if you read the last post you know I was planning on making a will and getting some life insurance. It's been 2.5 years and I've made zero progress on those fronts, which I realize is terrible and I really need to get on that. Likewise, I still don't have a specific plan for the kids' college beyond ""let's just generically save money and we will cash flow college or figure it out"".

For my career, I've got one last level to go as an individual contributor in my field. If I stay at my new company, I'm probably a couple years out from achieving it, but I could probably get it as soon as the end of this year if I go back to my old job. That would allow me to end my career in the $200k range which I think is a solid goal.

#The *End* End

Is this my last update ever? Maybe, who knows. Maybe a retirement update is in order many years down the road, but really I don't expect our path to there have anything new or interesting that I haven't already covered (wasn't that the whole point of this series of updates?). 

Looking back on this, I like to think that I successfully made our journey to being millionaires as boring as possible. I was inspired at a young age to learn that the possibility of retiring early could be simple and didn't take an overwhelming amount of skill or knowledge. You just had to be as consistent as possible. I'm not to retirement yet, but I believe in the path we are on and I'm hoping someone will find similar inspiration by me just showing the receipts. 

Finally, I want to sincerely thank everyone for reading and commenting over the years.

2023-05-19,Our FIRE Journey & The PE Career Path (28M Finance / 28F Tech),"Our FIRE Journey & The PE Career Path (28M Finance / 28F Tech) I wasn't going to post something like this until my ""go f\*\*\* myself"" post in a few years, but I have come to actually enjoy my job the last year, which was something I didn't think was possible after making the decision to work in investment banking / private equity. Now that I am starting to see this more as a journey and not just surviving until the end, I am writing this to take inventory of our progress to date, explain the career path for those interested, and hopefully motivate others pursuing the same path. Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

*Disclaimer upfront that, based on my experience in this community, posts like this tend to draw snarky remarks, but hopefully some will see the value in the thinking / learnings shared. Feel free to skip past the numbers to the end of the post to the (hopefully) helpful / interesting parts. The PE industry is very opaque in terms of pay and career progression.*

&#x200B;

**Background**

I am 28M, and my wife is 28F. DINK. We met in freshmen year of college and got married in 2018. We both come from first-generation, lower-middle class immigrant families who instilled into us the value of hard work and financial stability. For me particularly, I always knew I wanted to pursue FIRE, even in high school -- I just didn't know there was a term for it back then. With support from our families and financial aid, we were both able to graduate debt-free. And I was fortunate to have found a partner who shares the FIRE mindset. Luck played a huge part in this part of our FIRE journey.

&#x200B;

**Our Jobs**

I worked my way up the traditional investment banking (IB) to private equity (PE) route, and am at the upper-middle level at a large PE firm. For those unfamiliar, typically people do two years in IB (advising companies on things like M&A) with the goal of breaking into PE (buying / selling entire companies) or hedge funds (buying / selling shares of companies in the public markets).

My wife is a product manager at a tech firm. She has historically worked at start-ups; I always joked I was the steady income and she was the call option to the upside with her start-up equity. However, none of her start-ups hit. She is now working at one of the more established tech companies with less moonshot equity upside and higher guaranteed pay.

&#x200B;

**PE Pay Description & Our Income Progression**

The majority of IB / PE pay comes in the form of a year-end bonus that is 100-200% of base pay; the payout is usually guaranteed, just the amount might fluctuate slightly. Also, as you move up in PE, you start earning carry. Carry is essentially a share of the fund profits. Funds usually charge 20% carry on excess profits above a 1x returns hurdle, so a $20B PE fund (which typically targets 2x returns) would generate $20B of excess profits, of which 20%, or $4B of carry, is split among the carry pool. If you are allocated 2 points out of the 2,000 point pool (i.e., the 20% in percentage points), you should expect $4MM over the 5-7 year life of the fund if the fund hits target performance, and if your firm is investing out of multiple funds (i.e., fund life overlapping), the $4MM is multiplied by the number of funds you have carry in. Carry is also taxed at capital gains rate (for now).

Hopefully the primer above is useful / interesting to those not in the field. Obviously, huge earnings potential if you work at a large PE firm deploying multiple large funds.

Anyway, our pre-tax income progression below. Note: ""Pay"" includes the year-end bonus, and ""Equity"" and ""Carry"" only reflect the values (at issue) vested in that year.

**Monthly Earnings / Spending**

While we make ~~a decent amount~~ a lot (EDIT: feels weird saying it, but comment section makes a good point), I try to move as much of our earnings as I can automatically to retirements / savings accounts. I find that doing this instills more spending discipline... though we are not immune to lifestyle creep primarily for our home and car. I think we are generally frugal (or at least not extravagant) in most of the other common categories of spend, e.g., 80% of my non-work closet is still free tech swag from college, and we bulk cook and meal prep every week with Costco.

Breakdown of our current monthly after-tax income and spending below. Note that we also try to save all of my year-end bonus mentioned previously ($90K in 2017 up to $525K in 2022, pre-tax), which is not included in the below.

**Overview and Thoughts On IB / PE Career Path**

These next few sections are what I really wanted to write. I went into PE very deliberately. My life philosophy has always been: work hard while you are young, so you don't have to work harder when you are old. I knew this path was going to be hell, but I knew I would push myself to persevere through it. This part is very important, because as you can see in the income progression, the pay increases significantly as you move up, but the pain that drives most people to quit is in the first 2-4 years. As a result, if you decide to go down the IB / PE path, make sure you have the grit to stick around -- otherwise you are bearing most of the pain without participating in most of the financial upside.

The IB / PE career path is not for everyone, and it is far from ""easy money"". The work-life balance is better for those starting out now, but when I started as an Analyst (and this was worse before I started), a good week is 80 hours, and I probably worked 90-110 hour weeks 50% of the time -- granted I worked at a firm typically considered to be a ""sweatshop"" but had great name recognition. The work you do in those first two years in IB is also very demotivating. Often you would pull all-nighters putting together long presentations that are ultimately not used or skimmed through very quickly. This can very quickly turn you cynical -- that nothing you do really matters. And the job is very unpredictable. Your weekend can look completely different on a Friday with no heads up, which really strains relationships with other people; my wife and I were doing long-distance back then, and there were times she would fly to visit me only to hang out by herself the whole weekend. I would say these are the main reasons many people quit these first two years: (i) the time demand, (ii) the lack of a feeling of purpose, and (iii) the unpredictability, day in and day out 7 days a week for two full years. Depending on where you work, and just like at every other job, there can be a (iv) -- the people you work with are a\*\*holes, and this is especially true in IB.

If you have survived and are good at your job, you usually pivot after your traditional 2-year Analyst stint to PE / HF (though some people choose to stay in IB for reasons unknown to me). I will focus on PE since that was the path I chose. PE looks to buy entire companies (vs. shares of companies in the public markets) with the help of debt financing, hence the term leveraged buyouts, or LBOs, analogous to buying a house with a mortgage. As a PE Associate, instead of making presentations and running analyses like in IB to convince clients to, say, buy a company, you do the same but for your internal committee to decide whether to buy that company. There is just inherently less BS work because in IB, you are constantly pitching clients hoping that one idea sticks, whereas in PE, you are the client and can be more selective with what opportunities you spend your time on; because now your job is to make investments, theoretically, you should very quickly drop any ideas not worth pursuing. I say ""theoretically"" because nowadays, there is a lot of money chasing not as many deals, so depending on where you work, there could be a lot of BS work to chase opportunities that have a low chance of success.

I would say that being an Associate in PE is less physical pain than in IB, but more demanding in other ways. In IB, what you do is inconsequential. You are mainly just making pretty slides and running made-up numbers to show people, if they pay attention to them at all. In PE however, your analyses go towards justifying multibillion dollar acquisitions, and if you make a mistake, there could be multimillion dollar consequences. This creates a different level of stress, more on a mental vs. a physical level. And during crunch time, you do end up working more than in IB to minimize making any mistakes / missing something important. Ultimately though, the PE Associate job is relatively more interesting and intellectual, and gives a higher sense of ""purpose"". Though the latter is very luck based given the low hit rate in PE; some Associates can go years without closing one transaction, and that can be very demotivating.

Moving up from Associate to VP / Principal takes a lot of skill and luck. Now, instead of crunching the numbers and putting together the presentations, you are running the deal process. The cliché analogy is a quarterback, with your Associate being just one member of the team and groups of lawyers, accountants, consultants, etc. making up the rest. The job description now shifts from doing what you are told to telling people what to do to execute a transaction -- buying an entire company is as complex and has as many moving parts as you would imagine. In addition, you also need to make sure: (i) you build a good rapport with management teams so they are willing to sell to you, (ii) you pay the right price for the company and don't miss any red flags in diligence, (iii) you can convince banks to give you money to finance the transaction, (iv) you can convince your internal committee to approve the deal, etc. Again, less physical pain since you are more detached from the actual work creation, but significantly higher mental strain as you need to constantly think through what needs to be done when and by whom, and if anything goes wrong with the deal process, it is usually your fault. Most importantly in my opinion, it is such a different job that it can create a lot of self-doubt, especially in Associates who are used to being top of their class in the prior skillsets that got them the promotion in the first place.

This is where I tie it back to the beginning when I said I am starting to like my job. I truly, truly hated my job the last six years for all the reasons identified above, and only forced myself to do it to participate in the financial upside; I have thought about quitting too many times to count. The plan was always to retire by 30 with $5MM saved and pursue coastFIRE with my wife continuing to work (she really, really loves her job). However, I had a couple experiences the past year that mainly proved to myself that I am actually OK at my current role. Being the compulsive overthinker and organizer that I am, I have also come to like -- and dare I say love -- the project management side of the job; and as an extroverted introvert, I also embrace the ""softer"" side of the work, in moderation. I am distracted all the time now, thinking about how to frame the investment pitch, how to present myself to management, the analyses to highlight key diligence findings, the timing of all the work products to hit various deadlines, etc. -- and I love it, much to the annoyance of my wife when she is trying to talk to me at dinner. The public presenting and high consequences of the job still stress me out sometimes, but I now reframe these as opportunities to develop life skills that are useful beyond this job.

A natural question to end this section is: why go through all that pain if you can make the same or more with tech start-ups. That is a fair point. But the variance in outcomes was something I could not live with for myself and for my parents -- I wanted to make sure there was a high probability of our families living comfortable lives, and would gladly give up the (small) chance that we become mega-millionaires and the better work-life balance; the finance career path requires less luck to generate significant wealth and puts more control into your own hands in terms of working hard, networking, and grinding it out. Ultimately it is up to your risk profile: a more guaranteed path to an upper-middle class lifestyle or a moonshot at true FU money. Also, I know I am not smart enough to be one of the top engineers nor am I extroverted enough to go into sales, for example, but I have a good mix of both which is what you need to succeed in finance -- again, with less luck involved.

**Next Steps**

As I mentioned previously, I was adamant about quitting when I hit 30 and almost went as far as setting up a countdown clock for it. Now, instead of counting down the seconds to that day, I look at it more as a journey -- I may ride a bit longer or I might not, but how I feel about my job is less of a consideration now. I made a pact with my wife when I first started in 2016 that I will quit finance before we have kids, and I still believe in that; finance is a horrible industry to be a parent in after knowing many people who missed out on their kids formative years.

Despite knowing I will leave the industry one day, something I have struggled with and know will be an issue, especially given this change in sentiment, is when to walk away. I.e., ""one more year syndrome"", but with ""one more year"" netting $3MM+. Being risk averse, I like the thought of building a larger buffer for unexpected events, especially during my peak earning years. E.g., if I coastFIRE at a more relaxed corporate job earning $200K, it would take 10+ years excl. compounded growth to equal each year I stay in PE. This is still something I am working through and preparing myself for mentally. The framework I have come up with so far is to not focus on the absolute $ earnings of ""one more year"", but the incremental % it adds to our net worth. I.e., hopefully by the time I leave, we will have saved up $5-10MM, so ""one more year"" would only add \~20% to our net worth after-tax.

&#x200B;

**Concluding Remarks**

Hopefully the numbers didn't turn people away from the thoughts I had on the IB / PE career path, which were really what I wanted to share. I see a lot of people defaulting to saying high earners -- particularly in finance in this case -- should have their FIRE journey discounted because they ""have it easy"" with their high earnings. Hopefully, people have a better sense of what ""finance"" actually does now, and the physical and mental (and relationship) strain involved in pursuing this career path. No question there is a lot of luck involved in making it to where I am today, but if you have a clear plan, the grit to grind it out, and the smarts (or at least the EQ to come off as competent), PE is a relatively high probability, generally accessible\* path to get to an upper-middle class lifestyle quickly. *(\* firms are starting to hire more from non-target schools now, and you just need to put more work into networking)*

I don't think I am necessarily at the life stage to give out advice, but if I had to, personally, I think the saying ""find a job that you are passionate about"" *right out of school (EDIT)* is a scam -- especially if you are pursuing FIRE. Very few people are lucky enough to find a job they are truly passionate about that also pays well. My view is to find something you are good at that pays well, then suck it up and work hard to become great at it. You might come to like it as you prove to yourself and others that you are good at what you do. And worst case, you FIRE earlier so you can go do what you are truly passionate about.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-05-06,Suggest Locations to Live for Financial Independence?,"Suggest Locations to Live for Financial Independence? I have been working fully remote since COVID in 2020, and I don't expect that to change prior to retirement; so I can live anywhere with a good Internet connection.   I currently live in a HCOL area... the same area I've lived since college.  A basic 2500 sqft home with little property would sell for \~$2 million in my area.   I own a home, without a mortgage, which represents \~half of my net worth.   If I sold my home and moved to a lower cost of living area, I expect I could net $1-2 million with the difference in price for a comparable home, which could go a long way towards achieving financial independence and early retirement.   I am posting in this sub because I expect some other members have also thought about moving to a lower housing cost area to achieve FI earlier.

However, while I don't like the cost of real estate, there area also a lot of things I do like about my area.   I am in to outdoor activities, particularly walking and hiking with my dog.   My phone tells me my dog and I walked 167 miles in April.  We go on walks around the neighborhood every day that weather permits, including daily walks to an athletic field / dog park.  We also go on long hikes in scenic areas each weekend, sometimes multiday hiking trips.  My area is rated as one of the best areas for pedestrian safety in the US, with wide sidewalks and lots of trails.   There are also some quality hiking areas within a 1 hour drive.

The climate is great and  supports going the walks outside all year round that I like -- no snow in winter and rarely hot enough to need A/C in summer.   There is  little rain -- average \~10 inches precipitation per year, and few mosquitos.     I doubt that I am going to find this moderate a climate in a LCOL area, but there is probably a better balance between climate and cost of real estate somewhere else -- not as moderate a climate as what I am used to, but a small fraction of real estate costs.   Having 2 homes in separate LCOL areas (one for winter and one for summer) is another option, and still could probably be done for a small fraction of my current area.  Maybe one could be rented/Airbnb during the season I am not using it.  For example, summer home might be near area some travel to for winter activities, like skiing, leading to a high rental demand during season I am away.

Ideally I'd like to live in a small town that has easy access to things like groceries, general store (Walmart/Target/...), and dog park.    Ideally I'd like sidewalks/trails accessible from home, and lots of scenic hiking areas within a short drive.  Rural, suburbs, and large towns are also okay.  I'm not into cities, traffic, crowds, ....  Homes in my area rarely have much property.  I like the idea of living in an area where options reasonably priced homes with larger amounts of property are possible (1+ acres)   Bonus if I may see animals in yard.

Does anyone have suggestions of what locations I might consider?",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-05-06,How are we doing? Looking for some general advice on next steps.,"How are we doing? Looking for some general advice on next steps. I feel I may be a bit late to the game, only this year reading about financial independence and early retirement with some higher spending and debt from previous years due helping out a friend, pet care, wedding costs, and entertainment/vacations/cruises. My family had no savings, so I basically took on money and was the first college graduate in my family. However, in college I learned to start investing in a 401K ASAP (started at my part time job at age 20 and rolled into my current career 401K), so I have always saved the minimum to reach the company match, and have increased savings rate to 10% of my salary as I aggressively paid down credit card and personal debt from my younger years and wedding debt. And my wife was able to save significantly as she lived at home until we were engaged.

Anyway, here is our situation at age 35 (me) and age 34 (wife).

**Salary**

Myself: $117,000 with annual 5% - 10% increases, more in promotion years. , roughly $70,000 take home after taxes and deductions.

Wife: $49,000, roughly $35,000 take home

**Savings:**

401k - $100,000 (5% Traditional and 5% Roth contributions)(3% employer match total)

Wife's 401K - $20,000

Wife's brokerage - $20,000

Health Savings Account - $500. Saving max annually starting this year, but drained due to ER visit.

High Yield Savings Accounts - $30,000 (4%)

CD - $30,000 (5% - 10 months)

Joint Bank accounts - $75,000. Mostly my wife’s personal savings, not for my debt. We want to move a bulk to HYSAs and CDs, and possibly some brokerage, but we want to save $50K for home down payment/closing costs, and $20K emergency fund. Basically hoping to keep this low risk and liquid at least until we have our home, which may take a while in today's market.

**Total Assets - $275,500**

**Debt and expenses**

Rent - $1,599

Debt - $11,000 personal loans (9.9%), $20K student loans (5.9%), $15K car loan (0%) - total monthly payments - $1,550

Credit cards - $2,000 remaining balance (7% promo) - this has been aggressively paid down the last year (wedding, ski trips, honeymoon, home and car expenses, pet care)

Other monthly expenses (Food, utilities, insurance, gas, internet, cell phone) - $1,500 (high estimate to be safe)

**Monthly expense/cash outflow total - $4,650**

**Total liabilities - $48,000**

**Net worth - Around $225K combined.**

I am wondering what the next steps should be? We are definitely going to move most of the $75K into more CDs or HYSA so it can earn more than the 1% it is currently making.

Should any be invested in brokerage accounts considering our need for a down payment in the potential near future?

Should we focus in paying down personal and school debt aggressively? 

Increase $401k to max? 

Should I consider any Roth IRAs even with the Roth 401K?

Thanks for any advice on how to take the next steps and best use what we have as we work toward financial independence. My goal is to achieve FIRE by age 50-55. I am hoping that is achievable.",0.0,Neutral,English

3 Year update: It has been almost 3 years since my last post when I originally hit 100k net worth. It seems like a long time but it has gone so fast. The saying is true the first 100k is the hardest it took me 7 years, the next one just under 3. Since then I have been promoted once to E-5. My pay went up from about $757 every 2 weeks to $1,175 while still living on a minimalist life style and stashing away as much as possible while still maintaining a healthy life balance/happiness.

here is a rough budget of my life style over the (past 3 years).

Split-

C Fund - 80%

S Fund - 20%

(Changed from a 70%, 30% split to be more inline with the index SWTSX (VTSAX)

All other left over income from my actual check was deposited into my ROTH IRA and bought SWTSX. If my Roth was maxed out for the year i would deposit the rest into a brokerage account and buy SWTSX as well.

Present Plan: Currently I just moved to a new duty station in San Diego and I'll be receiving BAH for the first time. Iv been in the Navy for 10 years now and plan to continue to 20 years for retirement.

My current projected paychecks after they normalize should be $2,636 My TSP contributions will be $1,078 with a 5% match of $192 Totaling $1,270 towards retirement.

2023-04-21,I spit out the sand,"I spit out the sand Time for my second ever Reddit post. 

I originally posted [my journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/q44kp8/i_crossed_the_finish_line_but_the_race_wasnt_over/) \~1.5 years ago, and I was overwhelmed by the support, advice, and general kind words. I never expected reddit upvotes and comments to be a motivator, but it really has been a huge mental help in a trying time.  

  
**Quick Recap from last post:** 

I am a software engineer working in a MCOL. My mother has not planned for retirement and this weighs on me. I am close to FIRE, but did not estimate my future expenses correctly when I made my initial goal. Feel free to read my previous post for all the gritty details on salary advancements and why I'm on this path.  

  
**Recent History and Progress:**

It didn't take long after my previous post to decide that I needed to DO something about my situation and improve it. 

[u/sea-fi-lo-fi](https://www.reddit.com/user/sea-fi-lo-fi) may have changed my life when they suggested I give remote FAANG a try in a comment on my previous post. When I got my next round of pokes from FAANG recruiters, I decided to respond to them. I interviewed and was hired to a fully remote permanent FAANG position.

My previous job was a unicorn. I loved my coworkers and the work (normally), I was making great money, had flexible benefits that permitted me lots of PTO/unpaid time, and 25% of my salary as a 401k contribution through semi annual profit sharing. Despite this, I left for my new job full of hope. 

The new FAANG position came with a significant (though not as much as expected) pay bump. After the bloodletting in tech stock prices in 2022, my total compensation (including stocks and annual bonus) is $240k/yr. With \~20 years professional experience, this is not a great wage at FAANG, but for a MCOL living area, I am far beyond any other company's ability to compete. 

Armed with this new position and additional cash flow I talked to my wife and we decided to purchase a house for my mother. We found nice houses in the area for 200-250k. I did a lot of research and talked to the bank and was saddened to find that we had to do an investment property loan. My mom's employment and the proximity to my own house made it extra expensive. I debated on cashing out my FIRE brokerage account to pay off the houses since the market was so shaky but I realized how foolish that was and held the course. I set 1/3 of my income aside for the down-payment on the house and started shopping. My wife wanted to join me in paying for the house for my mom (recall that our finances are 95% separate), but the agreement was that I would do the down payment and then she would contribute half towards the house.

My wife was then approached by a new company as well. They offered her a dream opportunity. Closer to home, flexible hours, 40k/yr raise, and work she enjoyed. She agonized over the decision and then chose to take it.

During this time, I also met a local Mustachian group. I've not made any new BFFs, but I did attend multiple events and even hosted one.

Things then very quickly went sideways. My wife, best friend, and mother to three children decided that being a mother wasn't really her goal in life and left. Without going into details that are irrelevant to this sub, I had a series of breakdowns and I'm at the tail end of Divorce #2. I have two weekly therapists, ended up taking a 3 month mental health leave, and I have my kids 50/50. I was given the house (and its equity) in the divorce, I am the residential parent, she is covering the children's health insurance indefinitely, and neither of us are paying child support/alimony but we are each paying 50% of the ($44k/yr) daycare bill. 

*“It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not weakness, that is life.”* 

**Present/Immediate Future:**  
I dislike my job. I was hired to be an engineer/developer and the role is technical but not that. The pay is too good to just quit, but I was in active discussion on leaving (at my wife's suggestion) before she left. 

FAANG companies have been having round after round of layoffs. I am preparing myself and my ""affairs"" to be well situated if a layoff comes. Specifically I'm front loading my 401k, I've paid off all debts other than the mortgage, and I've got a real budget for the first time in a decade.

If I get the axe, the question is if I can just... FIRE. My self confidence is destroyed. I am still broken. The idea of getting a new job is overwhelming and I cannot imagine trying to get in the right mindset to get a high level job when mentally I'm still eating paste. 

If I model remaining daycare expenses as a one time expense (per child/per year, assuming dropping to zero at kindergarten) and pay out that plus remaining divorce/mortgage expenses from my brokerage, I will have a paid off house and $800k invested. 

I don't think this is enough for me to truly FIRE though. Even though $32k/yr goes a long way in MCOL. I am still figuring out my financial situation. It looks like my current outflow is \~$50k/yr (after childcare, taxes, and insurance). I appear to be able to get decent [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov/) coverage for \~$300/month with a 50k/yr income. 

Since I don't appear to be able to pull the full trigger, my plan is to take a year off if I get the axe. I can repair my life and mental health, be there for my kids, and I'll be borderline FIRE'd anyway. If I do not get the axe, I've decided to stick it out. Two more years of saving plus average market returns plus buying down the cost of daycare is the sweet spot to get to my actual FIRE goals. 

**Money Thoughts:**

I was in a *very* dark place. No details to prevent triggering others, but the first light that broke my depression was FIRE. When everything else in my life was going wrong, knowing that I had options was the ONLY thing that cheered me up. Knowing that I could request time off and quit if need be gave me the confidence to do so. Having the money to buy a brand new bed and redecorate my bedroom rather than having to stay ""in it"" was key to my recovery. Being able to afford thousands and thousands of dollars in therapy (that is uncovered by insurance) was key to my recovery. I took myself on a couple of (non cheap) vacations to get away when the darkness was too bad at home. I was able to throw money at the problem when life got too hard (mowing the grass, cleaning the toilets, eating out).

The FU money was the difference in being able to meet these challenges head on and having to navigate the storm in a sinking ship. It was the absolute best thing I could have done for myself. 

*Money gives you options.* 

**Scattered Long Term Thoughts:**

I talked to my mom and withdrew my ability to help her, possibly indefinitely. She loves her apartment and its location. I am still nervous about her future. But I have had to take the awkward look in the mirror and realize that I need to put my own oxygen mask on first. 

Similarly, I have stopped saving for my kids' college. Between all of the 529s, there is \~$40k invested already. It'll take a big chunk out of each of their college bills but likely not pay for it. If the market is kind, I'll have a surplus that I can use to assist my mom and kids. I also have the option to get a job in the future (e.g. delivering pizza on the weekends) to help them. FIRE'ing as the kids start school with a 40-50k/yr 'income' and being able to get them on and off the bus and take care of life is worth more than an imaginary future where they all go to college for free.

The clouds are beginning to clear in my life finally. I look to the future with a tentative sense of adventure. If I FIRE next week or in two years, I will be able to find myself in a whole new place and I'll do it with the best kids a father could ask for as the best father I can be.

Dating is horrifying. As a (relatively) wealthy person with two divorces and a gaggle of young kids, I'm petrified that anyone I meet will be way more into my money and security than into who I am as a person. I'm uncertain how to approach this in the future. Dating at my age (40) seems to be fraught far more than it was when I was younger. 

I'm planning to do a ROTH Ladder withdrawal. This was not a good option when I was married but now it's very reasonable. It looks like I can rollover 40-50k from the 401k to my ROTH per year without paying anything in taxes if I file as head of household with tax credits from 1-2 kids. It also gives me the ability to withdraw a good amount from my brokerage without paying capital gains (0% tax rate under a certain income level). 

I'm not happy with the idea of leaving my kids or mother in a lesser financial situation. My therapist has been gently but firmly reminding me that I need to focus on myself at this point lest things go bad again. I'm also aware that being present for my kids' lives in this critical time is likely to be worth a lot as well. Sigh. There is never a perfect answer. 

I went from having a fantastic family and job and having worries about my FIRE plans to having survived family and job catastrophe with the hope of FIRE being the candle at the end of the tunnel. 

So, the sand is spat out. Life is dirty and complicated and unfair but day by day I'm getting there.",0.0,Neutral,English

1. Do you have a legal entity of some sort for your side hustle business (e.g., LLC)?
2. What type of write offs / deductions have you learned you can take and what type of documentation, etc is needed?

I will soon be doing some content creation. I’ve built up a pretty good reputation in my field to a point where people are interested in my advice and experience. There is an organization that will be paying me a monthly amount to create and post an agreed upon amount of content.  

In my state I can simply “be” a sole proprietorship without having to file anything. Seems like it’s certainly the simplest way to handle the business being a business in terms of creating it. I think, therefore I am. Any potential downsides you see with this?

Then, the tax exemptions. I believe I can write off my internet for sure. Probably part of my cell phone plan but not all of it? Obviously other family members on my cell phone plan aren’t creating content for the business (though, I may be able to argue my spouse has some level of involvement as well…but certainly not my kids or father in law.

2023-04-09,529 Plan for FI,"529 Plan for FI I’m 35, married with no kids. I have recently started working towards Fire. I have a total NW of $712,000 which includes my 401k, brokerage account, cash, bonds etc. We max out our HSA, 401k (out which 10% goes to pretax and 2% to 401k Roth), we also started backdoor Roth and what’s remaining goes to our brokerage account. 
Pie chart of my portfolio: https://imgur.io/ceaDPot
The Real estate portion is basically the home equity of my primary residence. Not sure if it belongs in NW calculations.

Problem: My wife and I haven’t had kids yet. We hope to have at most two kids one day, and would like to have some money saved up for their educational expenses.

Solution: Im thinking of opening one(or two) 529 plan and have the beneficiary as myself and later change to my child’s name.

Questions:
1. Does having a 529 plan limit scholarship opportunities in the US ?
2. We live in CA, does the scholar share better than vanguard, it looks very similar, as there is no tax benefits.
3. If we decide to retire outside of the US, will 529 plan be used for qualifying educational purposes outside the US ?
4. If we plan to have two kids, should I open two 529 plans today or just open one and open the second later after having atleast 1 kid ?
5. In the off chance, we don’t have kids or kids decide not to go to college, based on the Secure Act, I can move it to my Roth account but is it just a one time move or yearly capped transfer ? However, I can always take the 10% penalty and withdraw my money. 
6. I’m thinking to start of with $3k and a monthly investment of $50, will that be too less based on college expenses 15-20 years down the line ?

Myself M(50) and my lovely wife F(43).

\~2M in the FIRE pool:

	\~1M in various retirement accounts (Roth, various 401k. vast majority mutual funds/ETFs )

	\~$750k in taxable investments (vast majority mutual funds/ETFs)

	\~100k HYSA  

	\~50k in I bonds

	\~40K in invested HSA plans

	\~25k in CDs

	0k in bitcoin  

	0k in rental real estate

No debt.  We run everything through credit cards for the benefits, pay off in full every month.

House:  No mortgage, worth approx 300-500k.  I don’t include this in any of our calculations, assuming it will always be spent on some sort of housing - a smaller place somewhere new, rent, moving etc.

4 children:

	Child 1: finishing 2nd year of college, military academy appointment, totally covered.

	Child 2: graduating HS, college  currently > 50% covered by 529

	Child 3: finishing second year HS, college 100% covered by 529

	Child 4: finishing last year of middle school, college currently \~30% covered by 529

(Second marriage for us both, 3 households involved in raising our kids.  College financing gets complicated.  We are committed to financing the equiv of an in-state public college education for each.  Beyond that they can help finance.  Other households in general agreement, but you can’t really know beyond the 529s that exist now.)

If we take SS when we I hit 70, we get 60k a year in today dollars.  I am old enough that I feel confident it will be there for us.  This year will be my 35th year of working/paying SS taxes.

Current expenses:  \~85k/yr:

			\~46.5k/yr in general essentials (food, prop tax, maint costs, utils, medical, internet, cell, etc)

			\~4.5k/yr in child support payments that will end in 2 years

			\~13k/yr in travel/vaca

			\~20k/y in other fun or optional things (meals out, donations, gifts/kid splurges, light mental wellness)

With our kids being in HS and College, we expect to be at about peak expenses, with most costs going down over the next 2-6 years. We assume more medical costs and fun/travel will replace what will free up from going to empty nesting, leaving our costs roughly the same over time.  We feel confident we can trim 10-20k of expenses and still live a very fun life for many consecutive years should the markets require it.  50k/year would not be poverty, though limiting for sure.  A couple kids are not fully funded yet for college, but we have a plan to get them there and will sacrifice some vacations and fun stuff as worst case to get there in budget.

Other:

	Fully paid off RV and pontoon boat

	800 sq/ft woodworking detached shop filled from a lifetime of auctions, craigslist, etc.   

	Currently live on 11+ acres, large garden, trees, river and  lots to do.  MCOL, flyover state.   Plan to live somewhere else MCOL or lower after the kids are fully out of the nest.

	400-500k airline and the same in hotel points from years of work related travel.

	Everyone currently in good heath, no known significant medical worries.  All of our parents and siblings have their finances well in hand.

	We feel no need to leave anything to our kids.  Great if it happens to come to pass, but getting our kids to the other side of college with little to no debt is our real gift.

Short bio/how we got here:

I have been lucky and privileged enough to be in tech since the 90’s.  Never one of the 300k+ FAANG crowd, but lucky enough to be paid well and to live well below my means.  My first 401k was from my college job at Burger King, with me stuffing my investments every job for the following 35 years.   My wife has worked various jobs, taken a lot of burden of raising kids, and also lead a debt free lifestyle.  We don’t care much about the cars we drive and drive them forever.  I am about done with my 20 year old jeep, we have a 13 year old Prius that will leave with a kid, and a 5 year old truck we bought well used.   

My wife quit the rat race maybe a year ago.  I could easily keep working and stuffing another 50-100k/yr into investments, but I am really tired of it and have “been there, done that” with my career.  I am not interested in it anymore.   I started getting tired maybe 8-10 years ago and now with my kids launching into their own lives, I feel ready to be done and do something else with my days.  I am well past my career defining my life – I won’t be bored or needing to go back to work to “keep myself busy”.

Rough plan:  
 

With our large variety of investment accounts containing a large variety of taxable and non taxable assets, I am confident we can generate the right taxable income to take advantage of the ACA and pay only some nominal amount for medical insurance.  I also feel comfortable that something ACA-ish will be around for quite a while now that it is here.  The ACA is not perfect, but I think it is a step in the right direction and a step hard to take back.  We stay put in our paid off house, living fairly conservatively, until all our kids are off to college.

If I assume an ugly case of bad economic times and flat returns for the next 20 years and we end up blowing all 2M to get to 70(64) years old, we have the 60k SS from age 70 onward to limp by.  I don’t find that likely, but it is not a terrifying case for a 65-70+ lifestyle either.    I think our more realistic plan of spending fairly frugally over the next 4 years while kids launch, keeping spending in the 70-80k/yr and then doing something VPW-ish after year 4 has a very good chance of 70-100k+ for the rest of our lives, assuming “ok”/conservative market returns.

The kinda ugly:  

The various calculators tell me I roughly have a 1 in 10 chance of being dead at 60, a 1 in 5 chance of being dead at 70 and a 50% chance of being dead at 80.  Nothing is guaranteed in this life but death.  It is fine to be ready to live to be 90+, but it is crazy for me to expect to do everything I could be doing now as well.   We saved and sacrificed lifestyle creep to get here and for me the feeling of OMY gets pretty dulled out by life’s realities.  

The summary:

I believe we have won the game.  We could keep playing and running up the score, but the risks I believe now outweigh the rewards.  I am intending to give notice next week and be done working sometime to be negotiated, between end of the month and the end of this summer, leaving a well paying job to do whatever the heck we want to do.  I won’t be holding out longer for a 1M house on the beach lifestyle in our 60s, trading it in on a few more years of independence in my 50s.  

If you would keep working a few more years in my place, I would love to hear why.   Any other comments welcome too.  If I don’t get another chance, thanks for all of the information shared here over the years.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-03-25,Accelerating your FIRE goals via the Middle East option,"Accelerating your FIRE goals via the Middle East option I want to bring this subject up because I don't see anyone really talking about Americans working in the Middle East (Safer locations only: Kuwait, Qatar, Dubai, Oman, Turkey) as an option to accelerate your FIRE goals.  It has really worked great for me.

I am currently working in Qatar.  Clean, safe, nice people, things to do, bars that serve alcohol, can also buy alcohol at the state run liquor store, superb brand new underground Metro, cheap Uber rides, home to the outstanding Qatar Airways and direct flights to most all of the cool places in the world, cheap food and grocery delivery.  Qatar is much smaller than Dubai, but is moving in a similar direction to Dubai and encouraging tourism.  Nothing to do in Qatar on the level of Dubai yet though.

&#x200B;

The perks of Middle East (Kuwait, Qatar, Dubai, Oman) FIRE acceleration  - 

Good money, but long hours.  Typically 12 hour shifts with two days off per week

Housing provided free - The quality of the housing is generally great but differs per company.  i am living in a really nice 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment in walking distance to food and the Metro.

No bills other than the ones you create for yourself -  A cell phone bill is typically the only bill and mine is $20 per month for 4g 8 gigs of data and unlimited calls and txts.  5G is available here too.

No insurances if you don't own a car - I hate insurance companies

Lowered US federal tax liability - You can typically add 25% to your take home vs. same pay in America.  The first $122'ish thousand of pay is not federally taxed.  This number changes every year.  Also no state taxes depending on how your state is setup for overseas work.  Side note: Could be beneficial to change your state of residence before going overseas to avoid paying state taxes in states that still tax you even if you are overseas.  This can be done easily if you do your research - even without doing an actualy state to state move.

World travel experience - Being on this side of the world is great for travel.  Get a travel credit card for travel perks.

Cheap and excellent health care - Low monthly cost for a world healthcare plan and no copays or out of pocket costs at all for anything as long as you stay out of the US.  You read that right.  Go to the doctor, pay $0.  Go to the hospital, pay 0$.  If you need health care while in the US on vacation or something, expect deductibles and the typical BS that we live with in the US.

For example:  I went to the local Turkish Hospital here in Qatar (which is super new, clean and amazing) for an ear infection and had no appointment.  We typically go to what they call hospitals for a doctor visit, as they are fully featured hospitals that take walk-ins as their normal operation.  I saw a real doctor and was in and out of the hospital in 15 minutes INCLUDING getting my prescription.  Try that in America at any establishment.  I paid $0.  If I had some exotic health problem then maybe I would consider going to America for treatment, but for most everything it is far better here.

They generally like Americans in the above Middle East countries

&#x200B;

How to find work:

I have experience with and can recommend looking for a US company doing contract work for the US government on US military bases in these countries.  These include Vectrus, General Dynamics, Leidos, Ratheon, CACI and other government contract companies.  These jobs are not typically well advertised on job boards such as Indeed and can sometimes take some inside info to find.  (like knowing somebody working there already)  The DoD contracts change all the time, and some listings for jobs are advertised even before a government contract is awarded to a company.  This is frustrating, but it is the game.  This just means to expect to apply for overseas jobs and expect to hear nothing for most applications.

&#x200B;

Here is the strategy that worked for me:

Get a DoD contracting job at your local (or any) military base in the US and then use that as a springboard for your overseas adventure.  This will get you the required DoD experience and security clearance stuff.  Then you are an easy pickup for any overseas contract.  You can then talk to your coworkers at the US military base that have experience overseas and they can discuss their experience with you before you commit to an overseas contract job.

&#x200B;

Best bet is to google top 20 US government contract companies, then go directly to each company's web site and search their job listings from their site.  This sucks, but it is what it is.  You can typically search by physical location, which will get you some listings quick if you know where you want to live.

Additionally, I recommend you do a resume overhaul by someone that does it professionally on Fiver or other sites.  For 75'ish bucks, one of these guys will clean up your resume and get it looking good plus make it standards complaint.  Standards complaince is the key.  This will make it super easy to apply on these company sites and will automatically fill in their information gathering fields for you based on what is on your resume.  If your resume is not standards complaint, these fields will not auto populate for you and applying on company sites will be a lengthy and miserable effort.

&#x200B;

Also, there are options for working for local companies in the host countries directly.  This could be doing things like working for the oil companies or being a teacher at the local private schools or doing IT stuff.  This option comes with lots of unknowns.  Be sure to do your research as much as possible before committing to one of these positions including speaking to a currently employed American there that can guide you with any questions you may have.  You will likely be working with lots of other nationalities, so be ready to learn about other cultures and deal with some language barriers.

&#x200B;

Family:

Some countries are friendlier than others about bringing your family members.  Your employer should help with this, but be ready for it to test your patience.  Kids that need school will likely need a private school and this will have some cost.  A spouse could find work also, but I don't know much about this.  I am single and don't have any of these experiences to provide valid info on this subject.

&#x200B;

Freedom and privacy:

Nope.  If you are a gun totin' freedom of everything type person, this is not the life for you.

You will give blood to be here.  Literally.  They test the blood for who knows what and use it for who knows what.  You will also give fingerprints to be here.  They have video surveillance everywhere and some places require an App on your phone for this or that, which also tracks you.  If this is a problem for you, don't come to these places.  It is that simple.

&#x200B;

Safety:

Do your research, but these countries are all significantly safer than America.  In some cases, the entire country is safer than the typical American small town.  Let that sink in.  I don't lock my apartment door unless I am sleeping.  This includes while going out of the country for week(s) long vacations.

&#x200B;

Attitude:

Always remember that you are a guest in any country you go.  Leave your attitude at home, be patient and smile.  You don't need to learn a language, but learning a few words will be helpful.  Everywhere you go outside of the US will allow you to get by just speaking English.  Speak slowly, use few words and talk like a caveman and you can get by with English most anywhere.

&#x200B;

Overseas Saving Strategy:

You are not going to be taxed like in the US, so contributing to a 401k may or may not be beneficial.  Depends if your company matches or not.  Obviously go for the match if they have one as that is free money.  If not, then consider your time to FIRE and whether you wanna max out 401k if you are not getting the tax benefits as well as the timing of your FIRE.  If you are 40 and want to FIRE before 59 and 1/2, then pumping your 401k without the tax perks is not going to benefit you and could hurt you if you want to withdraw early.  Instead, pump money into a standard investment account so that you can access this money when you are 45 or 48 without penalty.

For me, I am not currently putting anything into a 401k.  I am taking 75+% of my income and putting it into a low cost set of index funds.  The rest, I am taking awesome vacations in Asian countries scoping out what my FIRE life will look like.  I don't plan on returning to America.  Ever.

&#x200B;

Pay:

You can expect that you will get a similar pay per hour as you may get in the US for the same job.  The difference is the guaranteed and required overtime as well as the perks of paid living expenses and reduced or 0 income tax.  The days of guys getting massive pay for working in a war zone are generally gone, but we are not entertaining working in a warzone in this post.  I have never considered war zone work even though it has been presented to me.

2023-03-08,The benefit of path to FIRE,"The benefit of path to FIRE https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ofaql6/hedonic_treadmill/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


Yearly update, I stayed put in my last job for almost a year and finally quit in December.
I started at $2M last year and ended the year with $2.1M. Added $200k and market still brought me down by $100k from my starting number.

One of the benefit of the path to FIRE is we can take some risks. I realized that in my life I have mostly played safe. So after quitting my job in Jan, I  joined another company at a much higher comp. Most of the comp is in stocks and will only vest if I stay for a year. So its a high risk, very high rewards. This is again a very stressfull environment but all I need is one more year.

I know the general consensus here is once you hit your target, find a job with a good work/life balance. I almost did the opposite to try to make as much as I can before I call it a day.
Risk is I may not last for a year and I may end up taking unnecessary stress with no reward (eg if I did  not hit one year).

2023-03-08,Accepting Starting Late and Thanks to This Sub,"Accepting Starting Late and Thanks to This Sub I share this as a thank you to this sub, and as solidarity with anyone else who, like me, is not one of the twenty somethings who often post on here with already $500k invested. 38F, married and making over $200k/year combined as of Fall 2022. Found this sub and the idea of FIRE about six months ago. Starting late, but better than never.

We never tried to ""keep up with the Jones'"" or accrued debt beyond our cars (paid off) and mortgage. No college loans, we chose an affordable college (that was still a thing in early 2010's), both worked full time during college, including my master's degree, and lived at home to save expenses. However, we never really prioritized saving beyond general emergency fund and vacations or for other big expenses like home down payment and only late last year finally put a serious focus on saving for retirement. I work in non-profit (which my friends call taking a vow of poverty) and my husband is a software engineer who prefers to work for smaller orgs with interesting projects for his mental health and work/life balance rather than chasing FAANG positions. Passing $200k income per year is quite a milestone for us. We have always saved small amounts regularly towards my husband's 401k, but thanks to YNAB, no kids, discovering and committing to ways to spend less, getting a handle on lifestyle creep, and learning from folks on this sub, we recently passed $250k combined in 401k, Roth IRA, Traditional IRA, and a brokerage account. (I do not include home value in my calculations as I am most interested in tracking liquid assets. However, I am including a best-guess mortgage payment in my FI number to match reality since I don't think this is our last home purchase.) I recently learned I have access to a 403b through my work and the plan is to max out the 401k and 403b directly from our paychecks while attempting to also max out the IRAs in 2023 with money saved. 

We have a long FI journey ahead of us, and retiring early (before 65) currently feels off the table. However, being able to retire in our sixties with a nice cashflow allowing us more freedom and choices in our golden years will be worth all the extra work we are having to do now. So thank you for the information, for sharing your stories and your journeys, they are helping others along their path.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-03-01,Oops... we retired early. Opinions wanted! What budget can we reasonably afford based on our Net Worth and our allocations?,"Oops... we retired early. Opinions wanted! What budget can we reasonably afford based on our Net Worth and our allocations? Well, well, well if it isn't the tech layoffs... We accidentally retired early? My wife left her job after we had our first child about a year ago and I just was laid off last week. I was hoping to work 6-18 more months to solidify our finances after the market downturn last year but think we have enough MAYBE if we are smart/lucky.

This is a \~2 year update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/k14n8y/this_year_i_am_grateful_for_1m_at_age_32/) but not exactly 1:1 as I am now using my wife and I's combined NW numbers. Since having our first child we combined our finances much more and are approaching this as a team 100% where as we used to track our milestones/goals/finances a bit more separately so we both were individually incentivized to save.

So what now? We need your help to see which of our goal budgets seem feasible so please poke holes in whatever you can or provide reassurance based on your experiences, etc. Which budget would you use and what % chance of returning to work would you believe I would have based on that budget?

# Net Worth Breakdown:

**Personal use assets:**

Primary Residence is \~1.1M with 400k loan (2.75% 30 year fixed so will pay it off as slowly as possible)

1 Car, paid off (worth \~$40k). No plans for a second car as our residence is centrally located to our needs. We have bikes as back-ups.

We want to keep both the car/house and so we don't look at them as assets that bring in money. Furthermore, we are very lean on cash currently as we have been spending all our cash on renovating this primary residence. That is finished but only have about $10k cash on hand right now after outstanding bills have been paid and that just basically is the buffer money in our bank account.

*= $750k in personal assets that aren't really producing income ($700k house equity, $40k car, $10k cash).*

**Passive Investments:**

Taxable (Individual Tech Stocks) - $243k

Taxable (Index Funds) - $103k

Retirement Roth and Traditional (Index Funds) - $497k

HSA (Index Funds) - $20k

529 Education (Index Funds) - $14k

Crypto - $201k

*= $1,078,000 (consisting of $634k of Index Funds, $243k of individual stock, and $201k of crypto)*

P.S. I am a huge index fund believer just like most of you. I got lucky that small investments in tech stocks/crypto ballooned and I have just not rebalanced because I believe in the companies/projects long-term and don't want to take the tax hit... 

**Investment Properties**

2 properties, total of $1,000 a month positive cashflow from rents after mortgage/maintenance if we keep them fully rented which we historically have been able to do.

$1,019,000 in value against $656k of loans at \~3% 30 year fixed with about 27 years left on average (so will pay them off as slowly as possible).

*= $363,000 of investment property equity + $1,000/month cash flow from renting them out after paying mortgages/expenses. Would you include this equity as money you can pull against for the 4% rule?*

# Goal Budgets - Which to choose?

We are an early 30s married couple with one 18 month old. Would likely want to have a second child, slight chance of a third.

**ABSOLUTE LEANEST BUDGET: $54,000/year** if we don't have any emergencies and spend on necessities only, minimal gifting, etc. We did just renovate the house thoroughly so it may be doable?

**CURRENT PLANNED BUDGET: $60,000/year** if we are careful and minimal emergencies/issues, very thoughtful spending even on groceries... even a couple thousand a year more could give us a lot of flexibility but not sure if more is going to almost assuredly force me to find another job soon.

**COMFORTABLE BUDGET:  $72,000/year** just spending as we want as long as we find good value in the expense. A bit of cushion to bank away money for emergencies and to expand a bit more spending once we have a second child. 

We know all about the 4% - 95% success for 30 year retirement but what parts of our net worth would you include in the nest egg to take 4% from and why? Our retirement goal timeline is to cover until we are in our 90s so more like a 60 year timeline for planning purposes (knock on wood). I am potentially okay with less than a 95% success rate as I can go back to work if needed. 

**TL;DR What amount of spending per year do you think we can afford with $1.45M invested + $1,000/month in cashflow? Do you count investment property equity in your 4% rule calculations? Our total net worth is \~$2.2M if you include Primary Resident/our car's equity. Based on the budget you suggest, what % chance do you think that I would have to go back to work rather than stay ""retired""?**",0.0,Neutral,English

1. Knowing we have large amounts in our retirement accounts which could/should double in the next 10 years, I'm trying to figure out if we should start putting more in our children's 529 or taxable account.  I think maximizing the traditional 403b and HSA at work is a no-brainer, but I'm debating whether we should continue to maximize personal IRAs. I recently finished graduate school (made huge IRA conversions each year to fill 12% bracket) and used 529 accounts for my personal expenses, but now we want to support (ideally fully, but unlikely possible) our children's college expenses (I'm aware of various ways of hacking college expenses). 
2. Should we also start investing in a taxable account? Our Roth account is large and have huge sums I will be able to withdraw while executing a conversion ladder.

But it doesn’t mean anything in isolation. My questions is ‘What is a weekend worth to you?’ Or ‘what would you do to add a chunk to your net worth, and what is a meaningful chunk?’ The ‘what is your number’ threads are always popular. It distills the process into a 10 character answer. But the answers vary wildly. 

I used to love the ‘optimal math’ type threads. But there really are only so many tax strategies and permutations on the handful of options. They get very redundant. Most of the threads I like these days are stories, with non-doxxing details. 

The FI number really is meaningless in isolation. And not everyone calculates it the same anyhow. 

Question 1: What is a weekend worth to you?  You have to spend it working 2x 10 hour days. You get paid cash. The work is hard but not miserable. 

Questions 2:  You have an investment opportunity. It is semi passive. You have no cash invested. A partner puts up cash. You put up time.  You have to make weekly follows ups and answer emails and phone calls.  It requires a monthly site visit. It lasts 6 months. It is low level annoying and stressful. The return is a lump sum. How much does that lump need to be to invest your time?

I am mid 40s and sorta retired/self employed/part time/coast

I have a long term partner who is a real estate agent who left w2 work a few years ago. I left FT w2 1.5 years ago.  We have a total of 3 teens. LCOL rocky mountains. 

We didn’t really go the index route. We went the landlord route and pretty much times the market crazy perfect. I had a modest pension coming at age 57. She had a standard corporate 401k. I had always owned a duplex as supplemental income. She thought that was cool and we decided to buy a few together as retirement padding. The market was favorable and we pooled most of our cash and bought a duplex. Then another. Then we buckled down and threw every dollar into 2 more the next year. Then we started flipping and plowing the flips profits into long term rentals. Then she got her license and plowed that into rentals. 

Our goal was 17 doors, roughly 8-9 duplexes was kinda the thought.  The math on the cash flow in 15 years looked good. That would be manageable and a very comfortable retirement. We went with 15 year mortgages and the properties were basically cash neutral after conservatively budgeting long term. 

We hit our long term FI goal, kinda. 

Then we were offered a trio of 4 plexes. Then a 6 unit. Then more. The prices were very good. The later units were 30 year mortgages. They did better in the near term than the initial units. Next thing we know we have 30+ units. Rates were favorable and I realized if we refinanced into 30 year fixed we would basically cash flow at or above our current household expenses. 

We hit a cross roads where the side hustle was consuming our lives. Lots of midnights and weekends. I was taking vacation to renovate kitchens. The kids were growing up and resenting the houses. 

I put in notice at work and they asked for 6 months. Then 3 more. Then 1 more. I finally just picked a date and gave hard notice. They kept me on PT to troubleshoot issues, which I like. New boss is chill and respects that I am doing a favor, not earning real money. 

But I find myself still grinding at times. We have 8x our annual expenses in cash. We have maxed all retirement contributions for a while. I’m still flipping a house and added 2 more units to the portfolio in December. 

I have no idea what our net worth is.  Probably 2.5-3.5 million?  

The thing is that we don’t live that expensive. I have fairly cheap hobbies. She has super cheap hobbies. We did buy a bigger house but it is sort of a flip too. Older cars, discount vacations. Our annual spend is 75-100k. We could trim it to 50k pretty painlessly. 100k feels absolutely luxurious. 

So what are we doing?  Why am I going to lay tile today, on my own?

Partly because I have a hard time spending money on stuff I can do myself. Partly because I’ll do a better job. Partly because I’m scared for my kids. They may never afford a house without a boost. Partly because my parents aren’t in great financial shape. Part of it is wanting to build the stock portfolio to diversify away from land lord life. 

But 50% of it is just greed. I can’t turn down a flip that makes 50-100k in 3 months. 
She can’t turn down a client that pays 10-20k with often minimal effort. 
I added another duplex because it adds $1000 a month and I can think of many ways to enjoyably spend $1000, even though I don’t. 

At current trajectory we will be LCOL FATFI in 3-5 years. But I hate those guys.  I don’t want a sports car or a sailboat. I hate wine and Michelin stars. I’m a dirtbag who can’t stop getting dirty. 

I have kids every other week. On my off weeks I basically work full time on projects. 


A meaningful chunk to me is 20k over 6 months. 

A weekend value with my kids is about $2000 and without is $750.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-02-22,Four Year Update: 41 y/o FIREd,"Four Year Update: 41 y/o FIREd February 22 2019 was the day I retired.  Four year anniversary.

Last year's post is here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/syyykm/three_year_update_40_yo_fired/

**Expenses:**

I'm back to having the majority of my expenses tracked on Mint.  April and May of last year I was still using my Crypto.com Card a little bit (more on that later...) so I'm missing a few hundred or so in expenses, mainly food / grocery stuff.

[My Overall Expenses](https://i.imgur.com/fQcguIs.png)

**Taxes:**

In 2021 I had paid around $40,000 in quarterly taxes to Federal and $8000 to State, and still ended up owing $11k Fed and $5k State.   For 2022 I was not anticipating so much ""unexpected"" income, so I paid $8k / $4k in quarterly estimated.   I have not done my taxes yet, so I'm not sure how close I'll end up being.

**Shopping**

Big ticket here was $2700 I dropped in September to fully upgrade my computer, which I hadn't done since 2017.  It's nice to have a rockin' PC, especially since so much of my time is spent on it with video games.    The other $4200 is all in ""Amazon.""  The vast vast majority are food / snack / drink related.  I now get most of my Sugarfree Redbull (drink of choice) from cases on Amazon.   I do have some ""normal"" purchases though, like a electric kettle, household items like Ziploc bags, some clothes, mouse and mouse pad, Sony WF-1000XM4 Earbuds.

**Food:**

Again a big category.  A lot of eating out, pizza every week.  I'm doing better this year though, I think I've only ordered Pizza three times since January 1st.

**Health**

$4200 medical insurance premiums and $340 dental insurance premium.  I didn't really use my insurance, one small Dentist bill, and went to a Chiro for a tweaked back twice.

**Auto:**

$1000 in gas, $1000 in auto insurance.   I drove a total of 5000 miles last year.   I did end up needing a brake job which cost $230.

**Utilities:**

My electric bill is around $150 for three months of summer and closer to $50 every other month.  Gas bill is $70 or $80 in the winter months and around $20 other times.  My upgraded super fast 600 mbps Comcast costs me $65 per month, and my phone is just an added line charge on my parent's plan for $275 for the year.

**Entertainment:**

Man, I really need to cut some of my services I think.   Disney is $8, Netflix is $20, Spotify is $10.   Mmm, I wonder where my Prime is listed, must be up under Shopping.   Anyway, I should at least drop Netflix and Disney I think.  I have enough other stuff to watch on my Plex and I can download anything else I need.    I also spent around $200 on some video games last year.

**TOTAL**

So ignoring the tax section, my total expenses were around $27,000.   Still pretty much in line with the past three years, which had expenses of $23k, $29k, and $24k.

--------------------

**Investments:**

I'll just keep adding to the table from last year.

Type|Retirement Day|1 Year|2 Years|3 Years|4 Years

HSA Investment|$6000|$7400|$8760|$9453|$9237
Cash|$20,000|$9000|$135,000|$9345|$11,785

Market's a bit down from where it was a year ago.   My ""normal"" accounts are down about $75,000 from last year and Crypto is down about $400,000 from a year ago.  I'm still doing a $20,000 per year Roth Conversion Ladder. Overall still way up from when I retired, so all's good.

Last year I was involved in Crypto.com and the whole crypto yield / interest earning.   Let me find a quote from last year's post:



/u/dbcooper4:*The crypto lending thing to me seems the most obvious example of too good to be true. It works until it doesn’t and then you never see your principle.*

*Me: I disagree. We'll see.*

Well, we saw.  Everything exploded, many people lost a lot of money.   For me, luckily, I pulled everything out.   In April or May of last year Crypto.com started **slashing** all of their Earn interest rates and it was just no longer worth it to have my crypto locked up in their system so I had everything pulled out in April/May.   It was June when Celsius absconded with everyone's Crypto, and of course the whole FTX thing happened in November.   But I got everything out and it's all sitting in Cold Storage now, safe and sound on the blockchain.  Just goes to show that my old rationale of ""There's millions of dollars and really smart people involved in these companies, they are advertising like crazy and it's almost mainstream at this point: what could possibly go wrong"" was a bit... well, misaligned with reality.

**Life Stuff**

Not much to say here really, nothing much has changed.  I still haven't gone on a cruise yet (still thinking about it), and I haven't moved house (still thinking about it).   I've just been doing the same cadre of activities as always: dinner at my parents, a couple trips up to the Cabin with my college friends, playing board games and D&D, meeting up with old co-workers Quarterly.   Mustic, podcasts, video games, YouTube.  I'm cooking a bit more, and down a few pounds so that's nice too.

That's about it.  Everything is going great, still totally happy, never bored.   Never going back to work.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-02-20,Are we on the right track?,"Are we on the right track?  Hello everyone and thank you for reading. I like the format of the former weekly thread so I'll stick with it. 

\-Age / Industry / Location

33, Mortgage department of a local credit union in Seattle, Wife, 32, Non profit

\-General goals

Full FIRE for my wife in her 40s. Full FIRE or Barista FIRE (for health insurance) for me by 50 (some flexibility on this depending on income and job enjoyment)

\-Target FIRE Age / Amount / Withdrawal Rate / Location

Lets say 45 for my wife, 45-50 for me depending on full FIRE or Barista FIRE. / 1.5 Million / 4% / Seattle (willing to move to a lower COL area potentially in the PNW. 

\-Educational background and plans

We both have BA's, I have a degree in Hospitality Management, She has a degree in Psychology. No plans for further education,

\-Career situation and plans

Recently promoted to a senior position on my team, would maybe pursue management position in the company. Work life balance is most important to me though, I'm not chasing a higher salary at the cost of work life balance. My wife has 8 years experience in her non profit role. She's most likely going to be staying at her position /  non profit for a while. 

\-Current and future income breakdown, including one-time events

With my recent promotion I am making 66.4k, my wife is making 60.5k for a combined 126.9K pretax. Possible large inheritance in the future but I'm not factoring that into our plans. I would assume stable 2%-6% yearly cost of living adjustments if we stayed in our current positions. 

With our recent salary increases I now put 20k a year into my 401k (employee matches 4%), my wife puts in 20k into her 403b. 

\-Budget breakdown (Per month)

Groceries $700.00

Transportation $100.00

Miscellaneous (anything not in other buckets, eating out, buying second hand clothes, etc) $700.00

Utilities $235.00

Pets $100.00

Farmers Market $125.00

Mortgage $1,767.65

PT & HI $442.50

Cell Phone $100.00

Internet $65.00

Home Maintenance Savings (includes for home improvement projects) $500.00

General Savings $400.00

Car Insurance & Umbrella $115.00

Car Maintenance $150.00

&#x200B;

\-Asset breakdown, including home, cars, etc.

Home: 550 - 600k

Car: 12.5k

Cash-110k (This includes all of our HYSAs, Emergency fund, House Savings account, Car maintenance account etc)

My Roth: 30k ( VSMGX )

Her Roth: 20k ( VSMGX )

403b: 45k ( VTTSX)

403b: 25k (FFLDX)

401k: 10k ( SSDQX )

401K: 13k ( TRRNX)

Taxable Vanguard: 62k (VTSAX)

Total Investment: 205k

\-Debt breakdown

Mortgage: 360k @ 3.625% 27 years left.

\-Health concerns

Wife has a preexisting condition that may require us to hit the out of pocket max every 5-20 years. Another reason I'm considering just working part time (to keep health insurance) later in life, especially if I still like my job.

\-Family: current situation / future plans / special needs / elderly parents

My mother is retired on SSD, her income covers her rent controlled apartment. Her parents retired early, have millions of dollars, long term care insurance. Neither parents should be a financial burden on us.

\-Other info

I'm not looking to cut our expenses at this time. My personal belief is that I want to enjoy my life before we get to FIRE and not live as cheaply as possible. We already only own one car, live in the smallest house we could find in our HCOL area, we already only eat out maybe once a month. I'm not looking to go cheap on groceries, farmers market etc. 

\-Questions?

Current plan is to keep increasing 401k / 403b investments (until we max it out) until 5 years before expected full or partial FIRE then start a Roth ladder. Most FIRE calculators I use put us on track for 1.5 million in the next 12-20 years depending on returns etc. Does this math check out? Do we save too much cash still? Most of our 401ks / 403bs are in 2055 / 2060 targeted retirement index funds. Is this too aggressive for when we FIRE? Also our Roths are in moderate growth funds, is this too conservative? Anything else we could be doing better?

The calcs below all have slightly different approaches, but here's a list of ones I like and why. Please feel free to suggest any calcs you don't see there. Thanks!

This is the one I use the most, that I compare all the others to. I don't like how the inputs are on different pages, but I like the graphic output, which is easy to understand.

[https://firecalc.com/](https://firecalc.com/)

This one is interesting because it includes actuarial information about death rates. So, yeah, I have a 3% chance of running out of money at age 85, but I have a 30% chance of being dead, so 3% doesn't look that bad in comparison.

[https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/](https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/)

I like this one because it allows you to set a goal for how much you want left over. Some of the calcs will show you 100% success if you end up with 1 dollar at age 100. This one lets you set how how much nest egg you want left over for your kids. (Or your cats. Let's be honest.)

[https://www.nesteggly.com/fire-retirement-calculator](https://www.nesteggly.com/fire-retirement-calculator)

This one shows your nest egg in terms of how many days per year of freedom it will buy you. So if you have 500,000k saved and plan on spending 75k a year, your nest egg will pay for 97 days of freedom per year in retirement. That's kinda cool.

[https://engaging-data.com/freedom-calculator/](https://engaging-data.com/freedom-calculator/)

This one lets you show the effects of various rates of inflation which I don't see in other calcs. I just don't like the graphic it produces as well as the other calcs. [http://www.cfiresim.com/](http://www.cfiresim.com/) EDIT: Updated link from limpingrobot

[https://alistair-marshall.github.io/cFIREsim-open/](https://alistair-marshall.github.io/cFIREsim-open/)

This one differentiates between standard, tax deferred and Roth accounts to help you plan your withdrawals better.

[https://www.i-orp.com/Inflate/index.html](https://www.i-orp.com/Inflate/index.html)

This one it has sliders for some of the inputs which are fiddly, and you need to specify different income streams at the bottom. On the plus side, it has room for spouse income and is very clear and interesting graphically.

[chodthewacko](https://www.reddit.com/user/chodthewacko/) suggests this one. It separates tax deferred/tax free/. It needs to be downloaded or run through Java to work.

[jrjjr](https://www.reddit.com/user/jrjjr/) (Creator of nesteggly) also suggests FICalc. It has different withdrawal strategies, and lets you export or share your results. For historical data, it shows which start years would have succeeded or failed for your portfolio.

cranescult suggests this calc, which has a place for sequence of return risk which no other calc I've seen has.

This one allows for interesting back testing of other withdrawal strategies than the 4% model.

I like it! They have a free sandbox, or a pay version. You have to pay to be able to save your data, 48 bucks a year. It is very fine grained about sources of income, with starting and stopping dates, which I like. I have a side gig I will continue when I RE, and I will probably stop when Soc Sec income comes on line. ProjectFI handles that income nicely.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-02-06,First Time Poster - Hypothetical FIRE,"First Time Poster - Hypothetical FIRE Brand new to posting on reddit and just discovered this channel recently. I played around with a few FIRE calculators and think I'm doing it wrong because it's telling me I can retire in 2 years...

My wife and I have good jobs, I (39M) am in a sales role and earn around $300-$400K yearly and she (36F) earns around $150K. I will hopefully go through a level up this year increasing my total comp to $350-$450K. We max out our 401K (\~$40K total) and HSA ($\~3.5K total). 

We almost never eat out (I do take out once or twice a month) and are quite frugal. Our internet and phones are expensed through work and while we have a honeymoon planned for this year, we are doing this all on points. Overall, our expenses are consistent with mortgage, taxes, bills etc coming to around $7-8K/month. We just had a baby and I'm factoring his care into that total. 

We bought our house last year \~$1M and are pretty aggressive in paying down our mortgage with the market in such flux. We currently are paying at least an extra $20-$30K / year towards the principal. We are also making double payments right now towards our car loan $17K remaining. 

We each have \~$400K in savings/retirement and have about $300K in home equity. 

Just trying to get an idea of how we are doing and if there is something we should be more/less aggressive with. We'd like to get into some more ""exciting"" investments IE real estate or buying into a business etc. this year but that's undecided.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-01-27,FAANG - High Risk vs. High Reward,"FAANG - High Risk vs. High Reward 29 years old -- I have a job opportunity in-front of me at a FAANG. I've calculated it would accelerate FIRE by 3 years (36 y/o vs. 39 y/o) roughly given the numbers I have in front of me today. 

I already save a ton of money and live a great lifestyle. I currently enjoy what I do, I don't absolutely love it but it's a great setup. Great boss, projects are kinda-sorta exciting, I have job security and rarely work more than 30 hours a week. 

Here's my thought process for jumping to FAANG: 

**Pros:**

* Stock appreciation, while not guaranteed, could pay handsomely 
* Domain/industry of team within FAANG is exciting
* Opens up higher earning potential 
   * sets bar of total compensation
   * name of FAANG 
* General experience working at FAANG/ at scale

**Cons:**

* Pressure to perform at FAANG
   * longer hours/higher expectations
* Technical stack is less exciting to me / could be boring and dreadful 
* Looming recession 
* Could be labeled as a job hopper if I don't stick with FAANG. 
   * I haven't had a job longer than a year, in 2 years. 
   * Tenure history: 6 months, 3 months (laid off), 1 year) 

**Total Comp Numbers:**

* **Current:**
   * \~ 194k (11% bonus included) 
* **FAANG:**
   * \~ 275k (23% of this is RSUs) 

\----------------------------

**Additional context:**

I don't have many responsibilities right now. I'm looking to get married soon and start a family but it's at the earliest 1-2 years away. I think my current job allows me to live life outside of work. I know that can change at the drop of a hat but I envision the unknown of FAANG not allowing me to do that, but then again who knows! 

I've been given some advice that taking risks early in your career usually pays off. But I don't know if I'm early in my career...I have roughly 6 years of industry experience already and with a FIRE date in less than 10 years, I have part of me saying to stay the course of the known but then another part of me saying take the risk, see what it happens, it will probably be okay. 

If I don't join FAANG I will probably get a Masters and slightly pivot tech disciplines. I think that would get me to a 300k total compensation in 3-4 years anyway.

2023-01-24,Put in my notice (33 with family of 6),"Put in my notice (33 with family of 6)   **TLDR:** Put in notice, married family with 4 kids “retiring” with withdrawal rate around 4.5% with mix of stocks, and real estate. Not waiting 

Finally pulling the trigger on early “retirement”, put in my notice with my boss last friday.  I'm married with 4 young kids (all under 9). I can not mentally call it retirement as my small brain can’t seem to get over the fact that my money would last our lifetime. I am calling it a mini-retirement or long sabbatical, with review of finances every couple years. 

One podcast/article that really helped me be more aggressive was this podcast [https://www.choosefi.com/flexible-spending-rules-for-early-retirees/](https://www.choosefi.com/flexible-spending-rules-for-early-retirees/)

**Current Numbers:**

$1,010k - 401k / IRA & 529 (mix of Roth/Traditional)

$42k - Cash / Credit Cards / Cars

$687k - Rental Equity($1,623k worth, $935k loans@ average 3.77%)

$942k - Home Equity($1.490k worth,$547k loan @ 3.625%) (house probably worth more Zillow says $1,690k)

$2,681k – NPW 

$1,739k – Invested Assets (NPW – Home Equity)

$80k - Expected yearly spending (Withdrawal Rate around 4.5%) – Note for spending we include car depreciation, and do not count house principal payment only interest. 

Note: this 4.5% withdrawal rate is real subjective as hard to quantify with rentals and a loan on primary home. Expense would obviously go down if paid off mortgage but at 3.625% rate hard to pay off.

**Timeline**

0 (prior to full time work) - In middle school / high school had lawn mowing business up to 25 lawns and worked as life guard as well – saved some for college but most went to paying for first car. Attended affordable engineering school with both Academic and Athletic Scholarships covering about half of total cost – parents did help out with living expenses. Had job related summer internships every summer. Only 1 job offer spring 2011 and didn’t come with benefits so went to Alaska to work on fishing boat, then returned for graduate school. SO always had internship or research work during summer but attended same school with similar scholarships. Even in college I had the dream of not working forever, my plan was real estate, I figured I needed about 10 paid off homes was planning to follow the BRRRR method (before BRRRR had a official name).

1 (2012) Left Graduate school after one semester to take job ($66k starting salary). (finished masters online). SO graduated in Spring 2012 started work ($72k starting salary plus small bonus). Purchased first house with intent to do some live in flip(worked pretty well more due to how cheap we bought it verse our great updates). Got married in fall. Paid down student loans and car loan (combined around $20k loans). My grad school was essentially free as I was a TA. 

2 (2013) Raise to 72k plus 10% target bonus, left job I was traveling too much(and too far of commute 80 miles each way) and work was limited and industry hurting(mining) forced 4 weeks unpaid leave. Did get a nice bonus before I left. New Job starting salary 66k. SO raise and good bonus. Purchased first rental house and did a slow BRRRR(not a great deal but cash flowed and learned a lot about construction and rentals)

3 (2014) Had first kid late in year. Both got decent raises and I traveled a lot early in year for work (pipeline work) this made quite a bit of extra in overtime and per diem. 

4 (2015) Took risk and moved to Texas(with a 3 month old) for my SO’s job advancement, and state with less tax and more income opportunity. Sold primary residence(sold for 30k more and moved with company so got bonus for selling quickly) and purchased new home. Got a new job with slight increase pay (or close to back to my original pay at first job).

5 (2016) Purchased 3 rental properties from distance.

6 (2017) 2nd Kiddo born (little bit in loss of pay for FMLA time) but also saved quite a but in daycare.

7 (2018) Extra pay wife worked ""turnaround"". Higher spending various items (new a/c, new cell phones, car repairs, ski trip, kids gymnastics, etc)

8 (2019) 3rd Kiddo Born (lost some pay for FMLA) (but less daycare cost), negotiated large raise towards end of year by getting another offer and moved up to be bonus eligible. (start year pay 93k to 117k+bonus)

9 (2020) Bought land in Mountain/Ski town (only visited once) and started design on dream home. Also expenses down due to covid (no commuting and less day care)

10(2021) SO left work, sold TX house, moved in with family during construction of house, bought 7 rentals with partner, also ""sold"" 50% of 3 currently owned properties to partner, Building MT House, approved to work remote, lived with family. Expenses down due to limited daycare, remote work, and living with family. 

11(2022) 4th kid born, bought 1 rental with partner, Baby #4, moved to Mountain town. Final construction cost was much higher than original budget and took way longer, extra cost not in budget. Expenses down due to limited daycare, remote work, and living with family. Took a ton of time off through FMLA used to test waters of RE in a short Mini-retirement.

12(2023) Put in notice January - Going to have a great year without work. 

**Advice (mostly standard FIRE stuff – tried to add maybe not typical ones)**

· Reddit flow chart is great advice

· Learn to cook and meal plan (this is more of a life hack to me than FIRE related) – but meal planning saves time and brain energy. 

· Work hard while at work but set boundaries (i.e. take your lunch break(I typically worked out, and left work on time(I had excuse of kids and used it) 

· Use your FU money at work. I used this to set boundaries, speak my mind, ask for raises, ask to work remote, etc. 

· If have kids use FMLA to your advantage (due to having multiple kids I used FMLA to create extra vacation time for me (granted it was unpaid but well worth it). I even went on week long hiking trip because of this. The way I saw it was a couple weeks now of vacation to work another couple of weeks later was well worth it. 

· Favorite resources (MMM, MadFientist, ChooseFI, Jillian Johnsrud, Coach Carson, Optimal Finance Daily, Biggerpockets, Todd Tresidder, Michael Kitces, Reddit)

· Car – avoid the payments – we always bought cash and really just tried to avoid over buying. My SO has only had two cars her entire life and I generally went with cheaper car due to normally traveling far both of us have had pretty limited car expenses.  Cost of ownership overlife time was very small for both of us. Even better work remote and just have on car, we did this for one year but with 4 kids really prefer 2. 

· Travel Hack – it really can be pretty easy money if don’t abuse Credit Card

· Negotiate Pay – in 2019 got another offer and used to increase pay from 93k to 117k, not only did this give me more money it really put me on radar of company and got me elevated to eventually being one of youngest shareholder (left before actually bought stock)

· Real Estate – use property managers – still will have issue but in my experience, they get higher rents thus paying for management fee. 

· Track spending (I have monthly spending numbers way back to 2013) – I don’t budget but do forward tracking.

· Biking / Walking – chose current location of house based on closeness to schools(walking), grocery store(bike/car), and activities (bus ride to ski mountain, and bike trail very close, bike/walk to playgrounds, and long walk to downtown). Our gas expense in new location is going to be basically nothing. 

· Rethink big expenses – my idea of rich life was owning a truck and a boat. I quickly realized that the cost of those two were not worth it, I had plenty of other hobbies that cost less and I probably enjoy more. Note – I probably will buy a boat in the coming years but also will have time to use it. 

· Geoarbitrage – We moved to Texas from Midwest and increased pay and reduced taxes a very large amount. We knew we didn’t want to stay but this moved helped us a lot.

· Dream big – I could never have imagined we would move to out mountain/ski town with 4 kids and stop working at 33 but here we are. 

**Backup Plan since above 4% SWR**

· Return to work (does not have to be in current job but I believe I am leaving my company in very good standing as I was just offered stock and one of youngest in company history). Even part time work could make big difference on SWR. I have tons of jobs I would be interested in doing for a short period of time some that make very little some that make a lot. 

· Move or downsize – we chose to move to higher cost of living are with a pretty big house for life style – if money really does become issue we can move to smaller house or different area in country. 

· Get creative with way to make money (turo, kids lawn or snow removal company, sell stuff at local tourist events)

· Profitable Leisure Time (also article by MMM) – part time remodeling/handiman, if buy a boat become fishing guide, work for hunting outfitter, ski resort worker, etc.

**Withdrawal/Cashflow Strategy:** (note cash flow is probably my biggest puzzle to solve since we have almost all money in retirement accounts and rental real estate) (We do have HELOC on rental and primary home but linked to WSJ Prime)

· Use small cash reserves / cash flow from rentals (rentals expected cash flow $25k, – note the play on rentals for me is mortgage paydown ($20k increase each year) + appreciation (conservative 3% estimate = $40k) = long term wealth)

· Once lease is up on one rental (summer) consider selling (while wait for lease going to use HELOC to cover expenses)

· If do not sell plan to withdrawal from Roth IRA

· Long term plan is Roth Conversation Ladder and Rental Cash Flow (note as kids get closer to college will really look at how colleges are counting income and consider making adjustments for them)

**Fun (i.e. what plan to do during retirement)**

· Get in even better shape (goal for this year is 1250# lift (squat/deadlift/bench) and run a half marathon under 7:30 pace – look up hybrid athlete if interested in this type of training) 

· Ski / Snowboard in Winter and Mtn Bike in Summer

· Coach kids in sports and teach them new skills

· Other outdoor activities (paddleboarding, hiking, backpacking, fishing, backcountry hunting, etc)

· More time with aging parents.

· More time for wife and I during the day when older kids a school / preschool – go on actual dates.

· Finish construction on house (finish basement, build massive lockers, garage storage, loft, landscaping, paint all trim, custom storage, finish butler pantry).

· Get more involve in new community and church.

· More time with extended family – month long trip to visit family in summer.

· Spend summer with kids instead of them in daycare.",0.0,Neutral,English

2023-01-01,What I learned from recording every penny spent in 2022,"What I learned from recording every penny spent in 2022 Retirement planning is based on having a SWR that meets your expenses.  I have never had a budget and had always ballparked my expenses at about 50K.  That made my retirement projections shaky.   I figured I needed an accurate picture of my spending so I could plan my retirement better.  This year I did an experiment and I wrote down every penny I spent, all year, using a google spreadsheet on my phone.   Here is what I learned.

I live in a MCOL city on the East Coast in a 3BR/2.5Ba Single Family home.  I had been projecting an annual spend of about 50K in retirement.  I ended up spending more than that.

2022 Total: 59250.93.

High (November): 8486.55

Low (December): 2486.86.

Average: 4960.08.

Clearly I spent more than my projected 50K, so that's good to know.  That will inform my baseline SWR for year one of retirement.  My future calculations will use a SWR of 60K.

However, why I ended up spending more than 50K this year was interesting.

An unexpected consequence of tracking every penny was that I realized that I was spending less than I should.  Knowing this year's spending would affect my income in retirement made me spend more, not less.  I wanted an accurate cost of what I consider living well.  So, that 59K I spent included not only the minimum expenses, but also 16K of intermittent purchases and house expenses that come up:

two guitars (5000)

one week trip in the summer (1500)

a new laptop (1000)

a new dishwasher (700)

a new fridge (1200)

copay for braces for a kid (2600)

three weeks in Paris (about 4000).

Some of that, like the braces and the dishwasher are expenses that could not be easily avoided, but everything else was extra, and represented to me the cost of living well.  So I now know that 60K feels like living well, and also that the minimum I could survive on in a year I needed to tighten my belt is more like 45K.  It wouldn't be living well, but in a market downturn, I could spend less if I needed to.

So for me at least, once I was recording every penny spent, I realized I could spend more and meet my savings goals.  This year I made the most I'd ever made and also saved the most I've ever saved.  I made 194K.   I maxed out my 403b/IRA/SEP IRA/457b/401a, made mandatory pension contributions and put a large chunk into my taxable brokerage.  In total, I saved 110,345, for a savings rate of 57%.  I also received an inheritance of 58K and was able to invest another 47K of college money that my kid didn't need because she got a scholarship, so the total I put into investments this year was 215,345.

I see no need to continue recording every penny spent this year.  In fact, I just got curly fries and milkshakes from Arby's and didn't write down how much it cost.  Yay!

But writing down every penny spent in 2023 not only gave me an idea of what a very comfortable SWR would be in retirement, it taught me I could spent a bit more and still make my goals.  I plan on spending at least 60K this year.  

So, do you record all of your spending?  If not, I encourage you to try it for a while.  What you learn might surprise you.",0.0,Neutral,English

Trying to do one of these every year/at milestones. This is the third one. At the beginning of my last semester of undergrad in 2012 I signed up for Mint, and I’ve kept it pretty up to date ever since. This was way, way before I started getting educated about personal finance and decided to take some career gambles, so the Mint graphs show all of that pretty clearly.

GENERAL NOTES
* Spouse and I are currently 33/34 years old.
* After around March 2019 the chart starts to reflect household income (added spouse’s assets/debts after the wedding).
* The huge random spike in December 2017 is just a glitch from when my student loan accounts got booted off Mint for a few weeks, so it wasn’t subtracting my giant student loan balance (discussed below).
* I am a transactional lawyer, currently in-house at a large tech company. Spouse is a recent MBA grad, currently an L6 with a large tech company.
* After waffling on it for a few years I decided to NOT aggressively pay off our student loans. Between my spouse and I, we currently have ~$300k outstanding. Instead I created what I call a student loan collateral account, which is a taxable investment account where I’ve basically matched dollar-for-dollar our approximate student loan balance for a total of $300k (exclusive of unrealized gains). Once COVID forbearance rolls off, I’ll maybe refi most of the debt down to a lower interest rate (currently it’s something like ~7% at the federal rates) then make minimum payments on an extended plan. Assuming 7% market returns, I’ll net some percent each year. And if shit hits the fan, spouse and I get canned, and I can’t otherwise service the debt, I can always incrementally sell down the collateral account to make the payments (even at a loss if things are really bad). I think the risk of that happening is pretty low, though, and in any case outweighed by the upside of leveraging that money into the market for decade(s). I think mathematically it’s the most advantageous approach.
* I don’t go too crazy with budgets or anything. We’ve got a nicer apartment, like to eat at restaurants a lot and like to travel, but otherwise live pretty simply without trying too hard.
* I added our cars to Mint in early 2023. We’ve had them for years, but their value shows up as “new” in 2023.

HISTORY
* Pre-2012. Grew up in a working class household. Parents didn’t go to college. Mom didn’t work. Dad had a trade job. Basically zero personal finance/career guidance from family. Got an AA. Decided to keep going for a BA and got into one of the big state schools. Majored in a social science. Started reading a law school forum and gunning to get into a top school. Worked at various fast food-type places over the years making minimum wage or close to it.
* 2012. Graduated with BA and worked for a year for local government. Made about ~$20k/year.
* 2013. Got into a T14 law school. Decided to roll the dice and go despite the insane cost ($270k all in) because I didn’t really see any other opportunities. Was definitely a gamble since ~50% of people who go to even top law schools don’t end up making enough to be able to service that kind of debt load.
* 2014. Living off student loans in law school. Got a summer gig after first year at a small firm that paid $20 an hour. Most I’d ever made.
* 2015. Still living off loans, but this is where the gamble started to pay off. Got a summer associate job at a biglaw firm that pays on the NYC comp scale. I got super lucky—I only got 1 offer. Could just as easily have been 0. Made like $30k for working that summer, which was the most I’d ever made (basically made 150% of my peak annual income in one summer). Most luckily of all, I got a full time return offer.
* 2016. Graduated law school. Passed the bar. Racked up some heavy credit card debt since I wasn’t getting student loans any more but had to cover COL for several months. Started full time at the firm. Salary $180k/year (but just for the back end of the year, so really just like $30k in 2016).
* 2017. Still at firm. Salary still $180k+$15k bonus. Paid off credit card debt and about $50k in student loans (this was before I settled on the strategy noted above). Threw about $5k into crypto.
* 2018. Still at firm. Salary $200k+$32.5k bonus. Discovered the personal finance sub. Maxed all tax advantaged accounts for the first time. Got married.
* 2019. Still at firm. My salary $220k+$50k bonus. Spouse’s salary $60k. Discovered FIRE. Started piling cash into VOO/VTI/VXUS. Added spouse’s assets to calculations (+$140k NW). 
* 2020. Still at firm. My salary $255k+$92.5k bonus. Spouse’s salary $60k. Got spouse on board with FIRE. Spouse started a part time MBA at a top 25 school to try to boost household income in a couple years. COVID student loan forbearance kicked in so I was able to invest that money instead of making minimum payments.
* 2021. Still at firm. My salary $305k+$160k. Spouse quit job to do an MBA internship, so between the partial year of pay at the old job and the summer pay at the internship probably made around $50k. COVID student loan forbearance was in effect all year, so we were able to put a bunch of money into the market. Plowed about $10k into crypto.
* 2022. Got an in-house lawyer job part way through the year, paying around $300k. Spouse started a $200k post-MBA job part way through the year. Moved to a HCOL city. Turbulent market, but have continued plowing money into index funds. Overall, if you don’t count the $20k in “new” cars I added this year, we actually lost some ground on NW this year.
* 2023. I will likely return to biglaw (I miss it). Spouse will likely continue at her gig. 

NW BREAKDOWN
* $20k operating cash/emergency fund
* $1.02mm equity index funds (up from $980k last year); consisting of $530k in tax advantaged (401k, HSA, 529, etc.), balance in taxable
* $10k crypto (down from $50k last year, lol)
* $20k property (two cars)
* ($315k) student loans/monthly CC balance

2020 NW: $396k

2021 NW: $784k

2022 NW: $787k (minus cars, $767k)



FIRE TARGETS
* $5mm NW. This is my FI target.
* $10mm NW. This is where I’ll consider RE.

Thanks for reading if you got through all this. This is pretty much an annual journal/reflection for me. Happy to chat/answer questions about anything.",0.0,Neutral,English

Silicon Valley Bank [collapsed on Friday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/svb-financial-pulls-capital-raise-explores-alternatives-including-possible-sale-sources-say-11de7522?st=n8k5sfijmrslhqe), becoming the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history in terms of assets. On Sunday, regulators also [took control of Signature Bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/signature-bank-is-shut-by-regulators-after-svb-failure-a5f9e0f7?st=rqheapcz7i70sq9) and [rolled out emergency measures](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-rolls-out-emergency-measures-to-prevent-banking-crisis-ba4d7f98?st=099a0fcprdltckb) to prevent a banking crisis and guarantee depositors access to their money. This means businesses with big deposits stuck at the banks will get their money out, though [likely not soon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-offers-aid-to-silicon-valley-bank-customers-4a8c3f1c?st=b21fgpfmrxh50x1).

This meltdown has exposed a new set of vulnerabilities for the financial system — and the rest of [the banking system is on edge](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-braces-for-the-next-silicon-valley-bank-956b8f03?st=4weob1ikkgc2c8l).

Synaptics is a fun read that's had three distinct phases in its life: a focus on PC, a focus on mobile and now a focus on IoT chips. IoT is expected to be a strong sub-sector so there's a potential for strong growth.

**tickers -- NASDAQ:HITI / TSXV:HITI**

**GLOBAL CANNABIS (brick&mortar & e-commerce)**

**INVESTOR PRESENTATION:** [https://hightideinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/High-Tide-Investor-Presentation-Aug-2-2023.pdf](https://hightideinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/High-Tide-Investor-Presentation-Aug-2-2023.pdf)

**ORIGIN STORY snapshot:**    CEO & Chief Biz Strategist Raj Grover started the company that    became High Tide with just $50K and a vision. With never than $30M cash    in the bank, Raj strategically grew one store into the 155 Store,    multi-vertical, $472M (CAD) '23 run rate growth monster of a    brick&mortar and global e-commerce empire you see today. This feat    is most impressive considering revenue was $8M just 4 years ago. A    rarity in the Cannabis sector, Raj is a true self-made entrepreneur and    responsible steward of capital focused on strategic expansion &    operational excellence. (more info in the ""RAJ"" section below)

**STRATEGY Summary:**    Lean, mean retail machine building a global digital footprint with    diverse revenue streams, which help fuel the growth of their high    lifetime value (LTV) global customer database of cannabis super-users.

Wisely borrowing pages directly from the dominant retail company playbooks of:

* COSTCO **COST**: club membership = low prices = loyalty = market share
* STARBUCKS **SBUX**: $$$ is in selling the coffee, not growing the beans

High    Tide's strategy is unique and forward-thinking given how many   companies  are currently competing with themselves and the traditional   market  GROWING the product while oversupply continues to eat margins.   {So why  do we continue to hear all about the 50+ MSO & LP growers?   TLRY,  CGC, SNDL, ACB, HEXO, CRON VFF etc. are particularly offensively    unprofitable cash-burning machines, powered by dilution &   delusion.}

**1 IN CANNABIS REVENEUE**  
**High Tide Named Canada's Top Revenue-Generating Cannabis Company \[11/30/22\]**. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminadams/2022/11/30/high-tide-named-canadas-top-revenue-generating-cannabis-company/?sh=384eced66033](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminadams/2022/11/30/high-tide-named-canadas-top-revenue-generating-cannabis-company/?sh=384eced66033)

\~$347M USD '23 run rate is #1 in revenue compared to:

* LPs: TLRY SNDL VFF CGC ACB HEXO CRON
* Ancillary: IIPR GRWG MAPS AGFY
* MSOs:    JUSHF TRSSF ACRHF SHWZ TLLTF MRMD FFNTF {yet most people in the USA    have never heard of High Tide's 155 stores & global eCommerce    empire, perhaps assuming they are like the other companies with HQ in    Canada?}

**CAPITAL MARKETS Highlights:**

* UNDERVALUED
* NASDAQ-LISTED    + NO 280e + NO GROW OP = EASY TO CUSTODY: A higher % of institutions    can own/custody HITI vs an stuck-on-the-OTC MSO because HITI is listed    on the Nasdaq and don't have a grow operation -- which allows    institutional investors to get their compliance department's approval to    custody the stock.
* LOW    FLOAT: Only \~67M share float = rapid upside stock price movement.    Institutions, ETFs (MJ, THCX, YOLO, MJXL) and a passionate investor base    {affectionately known as ""Barnacles""} are steadily locking up the    float.

GLOBAL  THC + CBD +  ACCESSORIES STRATEGY

High Tide owns & operates a portfolio of cannabis-related businesses in several verticals:

**THC**

* [www.CannaCabana.com](http://www.cannacabana.com/) \-- **155 stores** are #1 in Canada selling THC, CBD, & Accessories.

{Same    Store Sales up 52% Y/Y. Gaining 1% national Market Share per quarter    since launching the discount club biz model late 2021. See ""Q1 RECAP""    below for more info.}

**CBD**

* [www.NuLeafNaturals.com](http://www.nuleafnaturals.com/) & [www.FabCBD.com](http://www.fabcbd.com/) \-- Top CBD brands in the USA with 70%+ margins
* [www.BlessedCBD.co.uk](http://www.blessedcbd.co.uk/)\-- the #1 CBD brand in the UK -- is now delivering to Germany  &   USA, and soon to  France & Italy. {European  takeover imminent!}

**ACCESSORIES**  High Tide owns 3 of the top 5 global  Accessory eCommerce businesses, and a 4th in the top 10:

* [www.GrassCity.com](http://www.grasscity.com/)
* [www.SmokeCartel.com](http://www.smokecartel.com/)
* [www.DailyHighClub.com](http://www.dailyhighclub.com/)
* [www.DankStop.com](http://www.dankstop.com/)

**SA -- Accessory eCommerce:**    With a $30M+ war chest, it's always possible that High Tide rolls up    another Accessory eCommerce business to add to their other four.

**GERMANY -- THC, CBD, & Accessories:**    Already planning to establish a presence in Germany while waiting on    the USA to de/reschedule. Might see some ground game in '23 to prepare    for '24 recreational sales.

**Leading Canadian Cannabis Retailer To Establish German Adult-Use ‘High Street’ Stores \[10/12/22\]** \-- [https://businesscann.com/leading-canadian-cannabis-retailer-to-establish-german-adult-use-high-street-stores/](https://businesscann.com/leading-canadian-cannabis-retailer-to-establish-german-adult-use-high-street-stores/)

**USA -- THC:**    Globally High Tide has 4,500,000 High Lifetime Value (LTV) customers    (\~2.5M in the USA) in their database who bought accessories (pipes,    bongs, vapes, dab rigs, etc.) -- segmented by Country and US state. High    Tide has indicated they will use their customer data to tactically    expand into certain states when cannabis is de/rescheduled in \~6-12+    months.

Raj stated ""We have been    in conversations with multiple U.S. groups for a potential  acquisition.""   Given all the factors (inflation, rising interest rates,  falling stock   market prices, Cannabis sector, access to capital, etc)  it's likely  that  High Tide will have 2nd mover advantage for USA  M&A at  attractively  low multiples. **{Boldly} restated they intend to be a Top 5 USA MSO.**

{While    not discussed by High Tide yet, they also have the option of setting   up  a high profit, low overhead partnership with an MSO to add a ""Buy   \[MSO  A\] THC"" button -- in select states when a customer goes onto any   of  their top online accessory websites.}

RAJ IS A SELF-MADE  CEO

Raj is the biggest shareholder (\~6.5M) and has never sold a share.

He started this company with $50k and one store and grew it into the empire you see today. And he isn't slowing down.

He wasn't handed millions which he squandered paying themselves and their friends first or expanding too much too fast.

He    is shrewd. Smart. Strategic. Charismatic. Transparent. And he does    whatever he says he is going to do, when he says he is going to do it.

This was a DATA DRIVEN decision based on successful pilot programs

Membership    in this loyalty program is FREE. Every person who walks into a Canna    Cabana sees a high cost for non-members, and a discounted cost for    members. When they realize signing up for FREE with their email address    and phone # (SMS) makes them a MEMBER of the CABANA CLUB, they will do    so in order to save money on that purchase and future purchases.

Stores    are stocked w/ HIGH MARGIN products like consumption accessories,  CBD,   and house brands of shatter & gummies & prerolls -- with  other   form factors later.

Market  Share   and Same Store Sales growth are WAY up (see Q3 ER recap above) Q  over Q   while the other retailers (& USA MSOs btw) are seeing  declines.

**This    is a DATA and MARKET SHARE / CUSTOMER LOYALTY grab from other   retailers  and the black market by running them out of business. High   Tide is  burning the forest so only the strongest trees will survive   &  thrive.**

NULEAF NATURALS ACQUISITION SIGNIFICANCE \[acquired 11/22/21\]

Located    in Denver CO, NuLeaf Naturals is one of the top CBD brands in the USA    in terms of CBD-blend research & IP, rapid growth, and    industry-leading margins. $16M of the \~$20M revenue is    direct-to-consumer, but the expanding agreement with Sprouts will allow    for wider B&M retail distribution.

It's    notable that their facility is cGMP certified. It can generate up to    60,000 vegan soft-gels per hour, which is 25% of their business.    Production, co-packing, & shipping of FabCBD was moved to the    facility for cost savings through operational efficiencies.

Once USA de/rescheduling allows, High Tide hinted that this facility could also create THC infused edibles and drinks.

KIOSKS (FASTENDR) \[launched 1/5/22\]

Currently 175 Fastendr Kiosks are operating across 120 Canna Cabana stores as of EOY '22}

The    Discount Club model is causing long lines out the door. Taking a page    from leading retailers in other sectors, this allows customers to  order   online or at a kiosk, and pick up from a ""smart"" locker. For  those   customers who know what they want and don't need the budtender's    guidance, this is a slick convenience. Very few dispensaries in the    world have this experience.

Also    mentioned in the PR is the desire to license this tech to other    dispensaries and industries which could turn into yet another revenue    stream.

Delivery will be made    available in as many location as allowed by law, but this offers a fast,    convenient, slick way of ordering / picking up. It also cuts down on    $$$ spent on budtenders while keeping lines moving.

\[With    plans to expand in Europe, I could envision a smaller ""Bud Room""  store   concept that almost feels like a vending machine. While not  discussed  in  the press release, the stigma of cannabis still exists  worldwide, so   some might be turned off by the idea of being seen in  line waiting at a   dispensary. Side benefit worth mentioning.\]

**Overall,    while this will increase profitability, this helps change the    perception of the company stock to THC + CBD + Accessories + Data +    Kiosk  -- which should help command higher multiples.**

* CONCERNED ABOUT RETAIL SATURATION &/or COMPETITION?

People    worried about ""saturation"" don't get that big boys like High Tide are    the ones that will benefit in the long run. Mom & Pops will get  run   out of business due to margin pressure. Meanwhile High Tide uses  their   position to negotiate better prices, which only serves to  accelerate   this process. Then High Tide gets to buy the best locations  based on   data while letting the underperformers close their doors.

Coffee shops close. Starbucks gets bigger/stronger.

Department stores close. Target gets bigger/stronger.

Taking pages from the playbooks of Costco & Starbucks is how HITI is winning the Retail game.

**High Tide is engaging in a price war it knows it can win because of its diverse streams of revenue.**

COMMANDING ECOMM RETAILER MULTIPLES

High    margin private label THC (edibles, shatter -- later flower, vape,  etc)   & FabCBD.com / BlessedCBD / NuLeaf a big reason High Tide is    projected to be net profitable later in 2023.

I own a barbershop and have 2 foreigners working as barbers. Most of the time ,i will be away from the shop (1.5 hours drive from my home). 

Currently , for sales, they will write down on a notebook. The shop don't have P.O.S system yet. 

The problem is ... many times the barbers after the haircut is done, they don't write down   on notebook and silently steal the haircut money. 
I do have cctv but unable to completely check everyday because I'm busy with my work and also i stay quite far from the shop. 

Anyone can suggest ideas to prevent them stealing money?

Edit : 
Thanks for the advice and recommendations people.  Really appreciate it. 
I'll look into the shop & chair rental idea, sounds good idea. I also have plan to install a motion sensor at entrance door so that every customer that enters the shop i will get notification on my phone. By that, i can know number of customers in a day, and can use that information to compare with the record book. 

Unfortunately, i couldn't let them go because hard to replace them because they are highly skilled barbers, and i paid high amount of money to an agent to get them. Finding a local barber is possible but they won't sustain for long time , in my country. ",0.0,Neutral,English

Asked him if the machine was paid off to the bank and he said he fully owned it and was paid off. 

For these types of equipment there’s not necessarily a “title” so I didn’t know how to ask for proof. I figured the guy was legit since he had a established company and it was actually paid off. 

Turns out now that the bank is looking for the machine to repo it and the seller has minimal contact with me. Never gets the phone and only texts me a few words. He also closed the company. I have no confidence that he’ll continue paying his bank. 

I’m looking for advice on how I can get out this mess if I can. I definitely want to keep the machine but I’m thinking it all comes down if the seller continues to pay the bank.

2023-12-12,Franchise contacts in Middle East,"Franchise contacts in Middle East I'm working for a big holding company in Iraq - what we are trying to do is establish branches of well-known western franchises in the big cities. We have the best locations available, wholly owned by our company across some of the big cities - we've even got staff etc. Teams in place. And money is literally NO problem - boat loads of cash available. We can deal with everything here. Nothing is insurmountable in terms of regulations/finances/local-market knowledge etc.

The problem is, most of these franchises have master franchise agreements with massive family-run holding companies in GCC countries. And usually these are the countries that control things in the GCC. However, this usually excludes Iraq.

As far as I know, the brands need permission from corporate to be able to operate in a country like Iraq, before it is even licensed.

I'm struggling to contact these franchises - no one responds to e-mails, phone calls go unanswered or they refuse to pass me on to the relevant person.

LinkedIn isn't much better - have had more luck with this but even here people don't often reply. I've got Sales Navigator which means I can find leads and message people etc.

And of the regional holding companies I've spoken to -- one of the following happens:

1. They sometimes either don't reply or tell me that they don't have permission to open/franchise in Iraq.
2. To speak to franchise licensing in head office - obtaining contacts for relevant person isn't easy and e-mails often bounce back - LinkedIn sometimes works but people just don't reply.
   1. I had a recruiter friend who was able to obtain contacts for me using a platform they use but even here the numbers are often outdated and e-mails incorrect (or I'm simply being ignored).
3. They say that ""we aren't looking at expanding into Iraq at the moment""...

I'm at my wits' end here - I need to deliver results but without even talking to relevant people I have no idea what the requirements usually even are for franchising well-known restaurants/cafes/outlets in Iraq. These aren't really listen online at all and seem to be confidential.

The only progress I've had is with smaller companies but even here getting contacts can be difficult. I'm thinking that perhaps I'd need to go to offices of these places in Europe/GCC to try to talk to people in person.

If this had been about opening a franchise in the UK/Europe then the requirements are much clearer online and it's easier to talk to people.

Saw mom watching Supernatural and multiple episodes Sam and Dean act as business men and they bring tablets around asking people to sing fake contract deals so they could gain access to a place they are investigating in search of demons and other monsters to hunt down for the kill. They actually also do the same when they pretend to be social workers and other government employees where they use the tablet to have a host of forms for people to sign so they could have access to a location or protect someone under authority of a government like an orphan child or a legally insane person.

So it makes me curious.... Because in so many business meetups my dad got involved in they totally use tablets for signing contracts and same with government fill out applications and forms I seen my dad sign hen meeting with a federal agent or some other person in some gov position. Same when he's meeting with some investing person like a stockbroker and real estate agent or a a store he wants to negotiate  deal with, etc.

It makes me ask......Since nowadays a lot of informal businesses and even a few small niche stores as well as individual sellers who own no actual commercial entity actually use a special attachment device to connect a card reader device to accept payments by credit cards or debit cards........... Why are tablets the norm for signing business contracts and government forms? Even filling out surveys and questionnaires? Why not phones or other mobile devices? The only portable device I seen that gets used to the same level as tablets are laptop with those special signing device thingy that often comes with an inkless pen.

2023-11-29,Lead Delegation X CRM Suggestions,"Lead Delegation X CRM Suggestions Hey 👋 

I’m wondering what tools you are all using to manage incoming leads. We get ~20 a day, and the value is ~20k per.

We currently have a sales@ address, which my sales team accesses daily. They then forward themselves emails and handle from their inbox.

The sales team also answers the phone based on their availability. The phone rings for everyone at once.

Ideally all phone calls and emails would be tracked through a portal, and automatically delegated. This would help to ensure the workload is balanced and all emails/missed calls are responded to.

Right now, missed calls are particularly difficult to deal with. We are with 8x8, and there is no way for the sales team to know if someone has been called back without asking everyone.

It would be nice if leads were assigned in a “round robin”. Meaning emails and calls would be given to different sales persons in a cyclic manor. If a sales person can’t handle a lead due to skill/capacity, they should be able to escalate to managers.

Would abusing a helpdesk tool work?

We currently use Capsule as our CRM and Asana for project management.

2023-11-28,"Pricing model question for the BA's out there, Connected Hardware Startup","Pricing model question for the BA's out there, Connected Hardware Startup I'm an intern for a connected hardware IoT startup in a mature market niche in agtech, where customers are unused to new things. There are mature competitors who have products with the same functionality, but inferior user experience. 

  
Our product costs $149 for the hardware, and $100 per year for the software subscription, whereas the Mean/Media Hardware Price of our competitors is  $650/$610 and the Mean/Median Subscription Price of our competitors is $18/$20.

  
I recently presented our product at a trade show, and overwhelmingly the feedback from customers was that they liked the product, liked the hardware cost, and hated the high recurring costs. 

  
My conclusion was that our customers are used to making upfront investments in quality products but aren't used to high recurring costs. Our CEO is focused on showing MRR to the investors, but this pricing model is making it extremely hard to sell the product.

  
Another factor is that we are the only company in the market that offers a free hardware upgrade to customers after 3 years. I've asked the CEO what the idea behind this is, because to me this just adds friction to the sales process by confusing customers on the value proposition, and would be a logistical nightmare down the road for the company to fulfill.  
Any advice? I'm trying to make a well-founded case that we need to increase the hardware cost (currently we sell the product virtually at cost), and bring down the subscription, while still allowing for MRR.  
Any insights are appreciated as I'm new to this.

Seems like the client is lying and evading payment.,"Advice needed: How do I handle non-payment and maintain the relationship? Seems like the client is lying and evading payment. TLDR: customer evading payment , should I go over her head to someone else? 

I have a 2nd year client that purchases large, prominent ad space for their chamber of commerce . My contact is the executive director(ED).

I billed the $6k back in July, and have been in direct phone, email or text communication with the ED since August to get payment.

She had some serious health issues develop over the last few months that have prevented her from being on top of payment and I have given much grace on payment due to her condition.

The delays are very suspicious:

1. Check was sent but lost in the mail
2. New check sent, with tracking number, waited 10 biz days , no check. Asked for tracking number,
3. She emailed me from hospital CCing her accounting person to send tracking number.  I “replied all” to this email to have the accountant call me and the email address came back as invalid.
4. I drove 10 hours round trip to pick up a new physical check.  Check deposited and seemed to clear, until I was notified that payment was stopped.  Alerted her of stopped payment and was advised “the accountant must have stopped the wrong check.

I went to the issuing bank, asked about stopped check. The teller slyly said, I can’t give any balance details, but I will say that if you were to resubmit that check today, there would be insufficient funds.

5. She said she would provide a cashiers check/money order(certified funds) and deposit in my bank account this week.  The promised date and time passed.  She said she gave it to her daughter to deposit in my bank because she was again in the hospital.

I need an off switch for after hours, so I can focus on things outside of clients.  I am no longer texting people, that way I can train them to not communicate with me via texts.  To many times I'm sitting with my daughter and a customer contacts me regarding an idea they have and it turns an already long day into a 14 hour day.

I'm looking for a way to automatically respond to texts with another text, simply stating ""Hi, thank you for calling, we communicate primarily using Email, Phone and Voicemail.  We do this to better serve our clients ."" Or ""We're so sorry but we're busy at the moment. Feel free to leave us a voicemail or shoot us an email and we will get back to you within xx time frame""...

Obviously those are just examples to give an idea of what I am looking for, I would not word it that way but hopefully you get the idea.

Or something similar.

Ideally I would have a way of rejecting all unsaved numbers and a client list, only letting personal messages on starred contacts go through without a response (I hope that made sense!)

The results? Truly remarkable! AI has significantly boosted their performance, and we're proud to have helped them set it all up.  
  
Case Study 1: The Pharma E-commerce Game-Changer  
An e-commerce site in the pharma sector had high traffic but low sales due to the unique electronic product they sold, which sparked many customer queries. To address this, a tailored chatbot was introduced. This chatbot clarified product details and offered installment plans for price concerns. As a result, the site's conversions rose to an impressive 30 to 40% of visitors.  
  
Case Study 2: The Instagram Influencer's Secret Weapon  
An Instagram influencer with over 10,000 followers, known for selling unique candles, approached us. He was seeking better engagement with his audience. In response, we implemented a chatbot to streamline communication. This led to not only enhanced sales but also a marked increase in interactions, with more followers, likes, and comments.  
  
Case Study 3: Call Center Magic in India  
Moving our focus to India, we collaborated with a call center working on a furniture campaign. They sought enhanced efficiency, particularly in their call conversion ratio, so we implemented our AI-driven call solution. The results were striking: the AI system facilitated conversions at a notably higher rate compared to traditional methods, demonstrating the potency of the AI technology.  
In Conclusion:  
AI is making a big difference. It's helping online shops, influencers, and call centers generate business and audience engagement. Our team was genuinely impressed by these results.

We use Royal Mail's tracked return service to get items to us, then we ship the repaired items back to the customer.

I noticed the invoices had started to increase in value but didn't check them all. We get busier throughout the year till the end of summer so this isn't abnormal.

Then recently one of our bills was double the normal amount, so I checked the invoice. Generally we get between 10 and 20 arrivals per day, yet I started finding many instances of Royal Mail charging us for 100, 200 or even 300 items PER DAY.

I queried this and they came back to me with the following:

""I've investigated the issue and can now advise that a credit of £5,640.32 + VAT has been raised. This will be allocated to your Royal Mail account and will be dispatched with your subsequent invoice. 
 
Of the 3,137 Tracked Returns billed between 01/01/23 - 31/08/23, we can see that unfortunately 1,467 items have been incorrectly charged to your account, for which we apologise.""

Wow. Ok, but hopefully it's resolved... Well I just got a new invoice and no it isn't, the latest invoice they've charged us again for 164 items in a day.

They offer no phone line for the finance team so I'm stuck with emails which take a couple of weeks each way.

We rely on Royal Mail so I can't just refuse to pay. Luckily we're in a good position cash wise so this isn't going to make the business go bust, but it does need sorting.

Should I be seeking legal advice and requesting compensation? RM have effectively held on to £5k of our money, and continue to over charge us, then offer credit only instead of reimbursement. WTF?!",0.0,Neutral,English

I will be going with my manager and his boss which is pretty much at the top of the pecking chain. 

Any help would be fantastic!

He said it was to discuss my views on how things have been going but there's also a job opening for a higher position that I would also be suited for but I feel like there's no way they're going to even offer me that as I haven't been in the company that long.

Said photographer price gouges me on 2 side by side 400sqft studios ($500 / FMV is $50-150/per unit depending on licensing and some other variables in our market based upon other quotes). We were giving that photographer exclusivity over 50+ units AND our other 200 customers.... they did this again to us with other projects where it became unreasonable ($800 for 1 SFH property / FMV is $250-$450 tops depending on licensing).

We hire another photographer, said photographer does great but then all of a sudden takes a turn in energy. They start missing photographing entire rooms. They stop asking for access info and confirming they access info prior to their shoot. They show up to said property call us we get on the phone with them and they don't mention not having access. They call and text us after we are away for the weekend to advise of this.

2023-07-21,Need Help Understanding the Business Leader Mindset,"Need Help Understanding the Business Leader Mindset I'm going to try and explain this as succinctly as possible. But I don't exactly have that communication style. We'll see how it goes. Feel free to bounce if I carry on too long for your personal reading pleasure.

I've been an employee/doer most of my career. However, lately, I've been in conversations with two different CEO-types about the potential to move up into the echelon of decider and leader.

However, with both of these individuals, I can't get a straight answer. I feel like I'm not crazy for wanting to know, ""What do you want me to do? For how long per day/month/year would you like me to do it? How much money do you want to pay me to do it?""

One of them, I sent an email to the other day that (hopefully) politely got that message across. I haven't heard back from them yet. So we'll see. I get the feeling that sending that email was some kind of breach of social CEO etiquette.

I just wrapped up the call with the another one and I felt like I spent an hour dancing around these questions and not getting a straight answer. On that call, the person said, we'd like to pay you for the things your an expert in at your rate, but we would pay you less for the things you aren't an expert in. Or train you for free for the things that you're not an expert in.

Both of these businesses are semi-established startups.

I would really love a frank conversation. ""We want you to be part of our team. We're brokeasses right now. We can pay you X dollars for your time, we need you for Y hours. Eventually, we'd like you for Z hours and potentially in the salary range of RQP."" Is that an insane ask?

I'm new to this world and frankly, I was angry after this phone call. They mentioned their own experience of doing things for free and eventually getting to manage their client's full portfolio. People have bills to pay, dude. It's freaking rude to ask for free labor.

I feel like I've entered a foreign country that I don't know anything about the local culture. I'm trying to determine if this behavior is standard practice or if I'm getting taken for a ride because I'm an uninitiated tourist.

Any insight would be appreciated. I feel so annoyed right now. I just want to go back to the world of doers.

( I understand this is a big mistake but this is not the advice I’m looking for. I have no clue what to do. He is not hurt, or in a car accident or anything like that comes to mind as I just recently contacted his family and they said they would reach out ( twice ). I know he has a new girlfriend and seems to be very involved but this is just totally unbelievable. I’ve never seen anything like this.

As of the 9th day, today, after writing a ton of things you could imagine, asking why, and all things of that sort I thought to myself I will just write a note explaining how if he just answers my call, apologizes, handles all his shit and never does this again I will try to move past it. 

This is an equipment intensive business and we have a lot of capital tied up ( me 60 % him 40% capital wise and 50/50 equity). 

I just don’t know what else to do or try. 


No, I don’t know where he lives because he just moved in with this new girlfriend an hour away a month ago, but, at this point I’m going to have to find out.

Also, I’ve been friends with him for over 10 years. There was nothing at all that caused this or was out of the ordinary before this.

I now see that bills are getting returned and our insurances are getting lapsed because the bills weren’t paid. 

I’ve even tried different phone numbers to text him to see if he’d answer from our clients and nothing.

This could cost us a ton of $, a profitable project, friendship and more. It’s beyond me.

It just seems like a total give up of the real world. The only thing is: he seems to be answering his dad and helping him a little with his company which is similar to ours. This whole situation is extremely stressful.

2023-05-14,Advice on building and managing a team - UK Creative Sole trader,"Advice on building and managing a team - UK Creative Sole trader I work in the arts and am relatively successful with wearing four subtly different but linked hats. I’m at the point where the admin work I need to do to support the core of my business is becoming a little overwhelming. Like today I spent 2h on the phone sorting out a flight booking because they canceled the flight and ramifications of that on my other plans. When what I needed to be doing was write a proposal document that needs done for tomorrow. 

I know I need additional help but I don’t quite know how to find or manage the help I do have. Or what questions to ask to work out exactly what I need. 

At the moment I work with a regular engineer (audio) and graphics designer & artist duo for any artwork I need and have an accountant. 

I’m falling behind on reporting to clients, booking my travel and accommodation, posting to social media and updating my website. Also there’s been times when I wanted to send a text to say “email x about y” and a nice email was made. 

I’ve been experimenting a bit with Monday.com to track things but haven’t fully gelled with it because my work just feels too nebulous or I don’t understand how my work fits into that kind of structure. 

Also I’ve never had a “real” job. I’ve only ever been self employed so possibly lacking skills around workplace management 

I’ve summarised this to my parter as the second lorry problem. I feel like I’ve got more capacity than for one lorry and feel like I need a second. But I don’t know whether things will keep growing or what kind of second lorry i need. I know what my work is like for the next 18 months so know I can afford some kind of lorry. 

My questions boil down to:
- how do you break down tasks so they can be delegated
-  how do you find people to work for you and how do you trust them with intimate parts of your work and profile (social media, payment cards)
- how do you grow from being a one man show to being supported by a team
- advice or resources on tools or learning portals (eg is slack better than email? Why?)

TLDR: business growing, need support. Not sure how to move from sole trader to working with others

2023-04-25,Any good time management tips for business owners that are extremely busy and have know time for marketing?,"Any good time management tips for business owners that are extremely busy and have know time for marketing? If you are like many other business owners out there, you have a hard time juggling all parts of your business. From satisfying customers to payroll, keeping your employees happy, and let’s not forget making sure the month ends in a profit. And that’s just your business life. We haven’t even touched your personal life. The thing that always seems to be put on the back burner in marketing, and that will leave your business with a slow leak giving your new and existing customers to your competition. Well that changes today because I got some video marketing management tips (Excuse the southern slang). If you want to better manage your video marketing for your business, just remember the acronym P.O.S. This stands for Planning, Organization, and Scheduling. 

# Planning

With anything, you need a plan, but with video marketing you need a well thought out plan. This will include you identifying how many pieces of video content you will be posting for the month, the type of video content, and when you will be posting it. This is your outline for your video content. An example will look like this:

***Video Content for May:***

Buyer - 10

Brand Awareness - 5

Value - 3

Motivational/Mindset - 2

Posting - Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays

# Organization

The easiest way to stay organized is by using a task manager tool just for your video marketing needs. Some I like to use are Asana and Linear. Linear is really for software developers, but I like the set up and the user interface. By using a task manager, you will be able to input the necessary steps that it will take to get your video content planned, recorded, edited, and posted. Sticking to the task manager will keep you from overthinking about the process, but it can alarm you with reminders so you won’t forget.

# Scheduling

This is the one thing that will save you the most time other than getting video content ideas from the topics generator called Trendy Video Content Topics Template, and that is a calendar. Yes I said it, a calendar. This is the one thing that has made creating video content so much easier. By having the calendar, we can write out what content will be posted and what day to post. This alone can relieve the majority of your stress for video marketing. If it’s written down, you don’t have to think about it. And if you are using a digital calendar, you can set reminders for when you need to post. You should see the alarms I have on my phone.",0.0,Neutral,English

We can trace the origins of both movements back to two groups operating in the mid-90s: the [Extropy Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extropianism) and the [Cybernetic Culture Research Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetic_Culture_Research_Unit).

**Extropianism**

Eliezer Yudkowsky, Robin Hanson, and Nick Bostrom met through participating on the Extropy Institute listserv (mailing list). Extropianism was a framework revolving around transhumanist philosophy, encouraging optimism and rationality.

Here's how it's introduced in [a 1993 Wired article](https://www.wired.com/1993/02/neo-futurists-of-the-world-unite/) by Kevin Kelly:

> DOES ANYONE STILL believe that human intelligence can solve all problems? The Extropians do. The '90s version of ""Isn't the future great?"" is sorting itself into a minor movement revolving around the term extropy. Extropy is the opposite of dissipative entropy. Extropians preach ""boundless expansion"" - there are no limits to social and technological progress, and ""self-transformation"" - there are no limits to what a person can do by taking hold of his or her own destiny. Author Ayn Rand is mentioned a lot.

One of their primary interests was the concept of the technological singularity, elucidated by science-fiction author Vernor Vinge in 1993. The members of this group [discussed the significance of the coming singularity](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/vc.html), as well as engaging in unfiltered discussion of any topic that interested them.

“Blacks are more stupid than whites,” [wrote 23-year-old Nick Bostrom on the mailing list](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/nick-bostrom-longtermism-and-the-eternal-return-of-eugenics-2/). “I like that sentence and I think it is true. But recently I have begun to believe that I won’t have much success with most people if I speak like that.”

Bostrom's [A History of Transhumanist Thought](https://jetpress.org/volume14/bostrom.pdf) examines the growth of the transhumanist movement and puts it in context:

> It has been said that the Enlightenment expired as the victim of its own excesses. It gave
way to Romanticism, and to latter day reactions against the rule of instrumental reason
and the attempt to rationally control nature, such as can be found in some
postmodernist writings, the New Age movement, deep environmentalism, and in some
parts of the anti-globalization movement. However, the Enlightenment’s legacy,
including a belief in the power of human rationality and science, is still an important
shaper of modern culture.

Bostrom also noted that Nietzsche's vision of the Übermensch might look like a likely source of transhumanist thought, but he argued it had ""as much or more in common with Nietzsche's contemporary J. S. Mill, the English liberal thinker and utilitarian.""

Framing this as Enlightenment vs. Romanticism is, perhaps, a useful thing to do. Rational thought and logic vs. intuition and passion. Dominance over nature vs. submission to nature. It will be obvious later why I think this dichotomy makes sense.

Robin Hanson created the blog [Overcoming Bias](https://www.overcomingbias.com/), Eliezer Yudkowsky created the community blog [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/), and Nick Bostrom went on to enjoy a career in philosophy.

**The Cybernetic Culture Research Unit**

Cybernetics emerged from WWII, more or less, as an interdisciplinary field whose adherents believed that nonlinear systems were all fundamentally similar in a way that meant progress in one realm of investigation (say, psychology) could be used to further work in different realms (economics, engineering, etc). John von Neumann developed game theory as a framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of rational agents competing against each other. Nonlinear systems breed complexity because of positive and negative feedback—this is why it's so difficult to understand how they work. Cybernetics was an attempt to unify the sciences by understanding how dynamical systems are influenced by feedback.

French continental philosophers and psychoanalysts were deeply inspired by the promise of cybernetics. Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Jean-François Lyotard, and Jean Baudrillard all approached culture and philosophy via this lens, and accelerationism appeared as an alternative to their former ideological allegiance to Karl Marx.

[This article in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/11/accelerationism-how-a-fringe-philosophy-predicted-the-future-we-live-in) explains this shift in perspective:

> Yet it was in France in the late 1960s that accelerationist ideas were first developed in a sustained way. Shaken by the failure of the leftwing revolt of 1968, and by the seemingly unending postwar economic boom in the west, some French Marxists decided that a new response to capitalism was needed. In 1972, the philosopher Gilles Deleuze and the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari published Anti-Oedipus. It was a restless, sprawling, appealingly ambiguous book, which suggested that, rather than simply oppose capitalism, the left should acknowledge its ability to liberate as well as oppress people, and should seek to strengthen these anarchic tendencies, “to go still further … in the movement of the market … to ‘accelerate the process’”.

The Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at Warwick University was a collective of cultural theorists led primarily by Mark Fisher and Nick Land.

Mark Fisher created the blog [k-punk](https://k-punk.org/) and Nick Land developed the neo-reactionary movement [Dark Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment). The accelerationist movement then fractured into two factions: left-wing (Fisher) and right-wing (Land).

[Vox has covered the disturbing rise of right-wing accelerationism](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/11/11/20882005/accelerationism-white-supremacy-christchurch). Left-wing accelerationists (such as Slavoj Žižek) tend to *encourage* right-wing accelerationists, because both factions aim to destroy the ideology of neoliberalism and liberal democracy. The RWAs believe the end result will be a conservative monarch (which explains their passion for Project 2025), while the LWAs believe the end result will be a communist utopia.

Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek co-wrote a [Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics](https://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/) in 2013, inspired by their reading of Nick Land's blog.

## Effective Altruism, Longtermism, and Bay Area Rationalism

**Effective Altruism**

Nick Bostrom said that transhumanist philosophy could be traced back to utilitarian J. S. Mill. Peter Singer, perhaps the most influential philosopher alive, is a leading utilitarian [whose ideas inspired Oxford philosophers William MacAskill and Toby Ord to found the Effective Altruism movemen](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism)t.

Based in the Oxford Trajan House, a building shared with Nick Bostom's Future of Humanity Institute (founded in 2005), The Centre for Effective Altruism was founded in 2009.

[William MacAskill encouraged his friend Sam Bankman-Fried to ""earn to give"" rather than working on animal welfare](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/sam-bankman-fried-effective-altruism-and-the-question-of-complicity). The rational and logical approach to charity, MacAskill argued, was to become rich and powerful. SBF founded cryptocurrency exchange FTX and defrauded customers and investors in order to get rich quickly so that he could use his money to further the cause of Effective Altruism. [SBF invested $500 million dollars in AI startup company Anthropic](https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/09/sam-bankman-fried-trial-500-million-anthropic-investment-ai-claude/), which is closely connected to the EA movement.

**Bay Area Rationalism**

Eliezer Yudkowsky seeded his community blog Less Wrong, also founded in 2009, with material he had written earlier, now known as [The Sequences](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/sequences). One essay in particular, [The Martial Art of Rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/teaxCFgtmCQ3E9fy8/the-martial-art-of-rationality), demonstrates the type of thinking that would dominate this community: Rationality. I refer to this as Bay Area Rationality (the San Francisco Bay Area being its place of origin) to distinguish it from the more general Enlightenment-era philosophical view also known by the same name. Yudkowsky also wrote the 660k-word fanfic [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/hpmor) as a recruitment tool.

Bostrom and Yudkowsky wrote several entries on Hanson's blog, Overcoming Bias, and the name of this blog hints at a major preoccupation of the Bay Era Rationalist movement: cognitive biases.

The idea is that you can gradually become ""less wrong"" by learning how to reduce your cognitive biases of the type popularized by behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman. Bay Area Rationalism is also guided by Bayesianism, which is an approach to probability developed by Thomas Bayes (actually Laplace, but let's ignore that). One of the founding ideas of EA is that most of us have an innate *spatial* bias when it comes to ethics—we care more about the people and events close to us physically than more distal people and events. Working to overcome this bias was an inspiring idea to Yudkowsky, and the two movements soon more or less merged.

Which brings us to the concept of p(doom).

**Longtermism**

If we have a *spatial* ethical bias, do we also have a *temporal* bias? William MacAskill and Toby Ord, the founders of Effective Altruism, declared the answer to be an emphatic: yes. Let's imagine that trillions of sentient beings may exist in the distant future. Aren't these, technically, worth more than the billions of people currently existing? And isn't the danger of them *not* existing more important than any harm that may come to people existing today? Again, MacAskill and Ord's answer was: yes. With this came the movement of Longtermism, a natural extension of Effective Altruism. MacAskill wrote [What We Owe the Future](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/25/what-we-owe-the-future-by-william-macaskill-review-a-thrilling-prescription-for-humanity) and Ord wrote [The Precipice](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/in-optimism-lies-urgency-toby-ord-future-humanity).

Let's get back to the singularity, for a second. What if we create AGI, and AGI creates ASI, and we all die? This is thesis of hard takeoff or FOOM, popularized by Nick Bostrom in his 2014 book [Superintelligence](https://www.ft.com/content/021d3484-fd1d-11e3-8ca9-00144feab7de).

According to Ord, MacAskill, and Bostrom, the greatest existential threat faced by humanity is artificial superintelligence. This ""x-risk"" is also the principal concern of Eliezer Yudkowsky. In Bayesian terms, p(doom) refers to your belief that humanity will be eradicated via FOOM. It's the ultimate doomsday event. And according to the logic of Longtermism, the trillions of potential lives existing in the distant future is currently threatened by this prospect. Which means that a utilitarian with a high p(doom) would be incentivized to do almost anything to prevent doomsday. Hence the term ""AI doomer"".

[MacAskill tried to help Elon Musk buy Twitter](https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2022/11/elon-musk-william-macaskill-useful-philosopher) by introducing him to his friend Sam Bankman-Fried. Musk had become convinced by Bostrom's simulation hypothesis and his concern that superintelligence poses a major existential risk. A concept originating on Less Wrong, Roko's Basilisk, amused him—he thought of the pun Rococo's Basilisk and searched the web to see if anyone had thought of it before him, [and that was how he met musician Grimes](https://www.vice.com/en/article/evkgvz/what-is-rokos-basilisk-elon-musk-grimes).

Peter Thiel funded Eliezer Yudkowsky's Singularity Institute, now known as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), and he also helped fund OpenAI along with Elon Musk and others. We'll get back to Thiel.

Swedish-American physicist Max Tegmark is a key figure in the EA movement. Tegmark is the president of the Future of Life Institute, founded in 2014. The name is remarkably similar to Bostrom's Future of Humanity Institute. Back in 2005, when Bostrom founded the latter, Tegmark and Bostrom co-authored the paper ""[How unlikely is a doomsday catastrophe](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512204)?"" They concluded that if humanity were to be annihilated, it would most likely be our own fault.

**The letter**

The Future of Life Institute issued [an open letter](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/) on March 22, 2023, calling for a six-month moratorium on training ""AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.""

Eliezer Yudkowsky chose not to sign the letter, and wrote [one of his own](https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/) that was published a week later in Time.

> I refrained from signing because I think the letter is understating the seriousness of the situation and asking for too little to solve it.

""If we actually do this, we are all going to die,"" he said. His rhetoric was alarming to many readers:

> Shut down all the large GPU clusters (the large computer farms where the most powerful AIs are refined). Shut down all the large training runs. Put a ceiling on how much computing power anyone is allowed to use in training an AI system, and move it downward over the coming years to compensate for more efficient training algorithms. No exceptions for governments and militaries. Make immediate multinational agreements to prevent the prohibited activities from moving elsewhere. Track all GPUs sold. If intelligence says that a country outside the agreement is building a GPU cluster, be less scared of a shooting conflict between nations than of the moratorium being violated; be willing to destroy a rogue datacenter by airstrike.

This message was at odds with his tongue-in-cheek post on Less Wrong a year earlier, framed as an April's Fools prank, where he announced MIRI's ""[Death With Dignity](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j9Q8bRmwCgXRYAgcJ/miri-announces-new-death-with-dignity-strategy)"" strategy.

One person who took Yudkowsky's post on ""Death With Dignity"" seriously was Peter Thiel. [He argued the Bay Area Rationalists, who he had supported financially, had transformed from transhumanists to Luddites](https://youtu.be/bVi8JwM86Oo?t=1624) (link to YouTube video).

Something had to be done.

## Effective Accelerationism

Effective Accelerationism, or e/acc, appeared on the scene about two months after Yudkowsky's ""Death With Dignity"" post on Less Wrong. May 31st 2022 seems to be the first time the term was used (on Twitter).

On Twitter is where former members of the Bay Area Rationalism movement have gathered to discuss what has now become known as [postrationalism](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/rational-magic). This subculture is also referred to as TPOT—""this part of Twitter""—and their shared mission has been to find an alternative to Rationalism in mysticism and spirituality.

> They are a group of writers, thinkers, readers, and Internet trolls alike who were once rationalists, or members of adjacent communities like the effective altruism movement, but grew disillusioned. To them, rationality culture’s technocratic focus on ameliorating the human condition through hyper-utilitarian goals — increasing the number of malaria nets in the developing world, say, or minimizing the existential risk posed by the development of unfriendly artificial intelligence — had come at the expense of taking seriously the less quantifiable elements of a well-lived human life.

It was in the TPOT-sphere that the ideas associated with e/acc seem to have arisen.

[Twitter users Beff Jezos and Bayeslord posted an e/acc manifesto on Substack](https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets). On June 24th (2022), Sam Altman wrote the following message on Twitter to Beff Jezos: ""you cannot outaccelerate me"".

The manifesto referred to the former head of the CCRU, Nick Land, and argued that the process of dissipative adaptation, associated with Jeremy England, could be seen as the source of cosmic evolution. ""Intelligence emerges as a smaller timescale specialization of this adaptation principle,"" wrote the authors. They also argued that capitalism is a form of intelligence. On July 21st (2023), Sam Altman wrote on Twitter: ""intelligence is an emergent property of physics,"" which seems to be a nod in this direction.

On December 3rd (2022), Altman wrote:

> ""(i used to be annoyed at being the villain of the EAs until I met their heroes*, and now i'm lowkey proud of it

> *there are a few EA heroes i think are really great, eg Holden

""So far as I can remember,"" Yudkowsky tweeted in response, ""we've never met. I'm curious as to what other heroes you must have in mind.""

This would soon change. Altman met Yudkowsky (briefly) at a party hosted by OpenAI, and got [a selfie along with him and Grimes](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1628974165335379973).

[Business Insider did a story on e/acc on July 28th](https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-tech-leaders-accelerationism-eacc-twitter-profiles-2023-7?r=US&IR=T).

[Grimes was the DJ at a November 7th (2023) e/acc party](https://www.businessinsider.com/grimes-calls-out-ai-crowd-before-djing-effective-accelerationism-party-2023-11?r=US&IR=T#:~:text=Grimes%20was%20the%20DJ%20at%20an%20AI%20party%20centered%20on,the%20event%20opposed%20AI%20regulation.).

This brings us up to speed with current events. E/acc, with roots in Fisher and Land's work at the CCUR, emerged as a response and a challenge to the EA/Longtermism/Rationalist movement described in the previous section. [Peter Thiel has advocated a type of techno-vitalism](https://wisdomofcrowds.live/p/the-temptation-of-peter-thiel) that seems directly associated with e/acc and techno-optimism. Thiel also [backed the work of neorectionary Dark Enlightenment thinkers](https://theconversation.com/an-antidemocratic-philosophy-called-neoreaction-is-creeping-into-gop-politics-182581), and Nick Land was inspired *by* Thiel.

Earlier I mentioned that framing this as Enlightenment vs. Romanticism made sense. E/acc is a reaction to EA/Longtermism/Rationalism the same way that Romanticism was a reaction to Enlightenment ideals. Here's how Isaiah Berlin described Romanticism:

> a new and restless spirit, seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms, a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness, a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual movement and change, an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life, a passionate effort at self-assertion both individual and collective, a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals.

This Romanticist spirit is closely aligned with that of e/acc, whose adherents believe unrestrained capitalism to reflect the will of the cosmos. It's a type of submission to nature, if you assume the term 'nature' refers to an evolving, Darwinian surge of creativity that permeates the universe. You can very well call this a type of Intelligent Design; reality is intelligently designed via physics by thermodynamic dissipation. The movement of Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" is illustrative of this self-organized intelligence

Nick Bostrom said transhumanism originated with J. S. Mill rather than Nietzsche. E/acc can definitely be linked with Nietzsche's philosophy—the Übermensch is the ""machine god"" spirited into being by humans. At least if you squint. You could definitely argue that e/acc is closer to the vision of transhumanism influenced by the Extropianism of the mid-90s. Ayn Rand and futuristic libertarianism is back with a vengeance.

## The ousting of Sam Altman

Based on current information, it seems like Sam Altman moved to fire Helen Toner from the OpenAI non-profit board, due to her deep connections to Effective Altruism. [Zvi Mowshowitz has described the events that unfolded from the EA/Longtermism/Rationalist perspective in a post on Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sGpBPAPq2QttY4M2H/openai-the-battle-of-the-board). An earlier post [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KXHMCH7wCxrvKsJyn/openai-facts-from-a-weekend) features more speculation and theorizing. Tensions grew, behind the scenes, and on November 17th the board voted to fire Sam Altman and to remove Greg Brockman as its chairman.

It is unlikely, I think, that this has anything to do with Q*. The letters of the Future of Life Institute and Eliezer Yudkowsky raised the alarm, and the growing e/acc movement countered by disparaging EA/Longtermism/Rationalism. One thing led to another and the EA-associated members of the board (Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley) partnered with Ilya Sutskever and Adam D'Angelo to get the votes to oust Altman.

According to [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/altman-firing-openai-520a3a8c):

> OpenAI leadership and employees were growing increasingly concerned about being painted in the press as “a bunch of effective altruists,” as one of them put it. Two days before Altman’s ouster, they were discussing these concerns on a Slack channel, which included Sutskever. One senior executive wrote that the company needed to “uplevel” its “independence”—meaning create more distance between itself and the EA movement.

[It was speculated in Fortune already on November 19th that this was a clash between EA and e/acc.](https://fortune.com/2023/11/19/marc-andreessen-reaction-sam-altman-firing-openai-effective-accelerationism/). The day after, it was also covered by [Slate](https://slate.com/technology/2023/11/openai-sam-altman-ai-microsoft-eacc-effective-altruism.html) and [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/20/e-acc-doomers-decels-openai-altman/).

I speculated about this [personally](https://old.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/17xyo1m/its_here/k9rmdr2/) on November 18th and I wrote [another comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/17yxl1x/the_head_of_applied_research_at_openai_seems_to/k9xiq16/) about it the day after. The language I used was a bit more polemic (I called both factions cults), but I think I got the point across even though it upset a lot of people (judging by the feedback I received).

Molly White has [voiced a perspective](https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/effective-obfuscation) that aligns well with what I've been thinking myself. [Émile P. Torres coined the acronym TESCREAL](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-acronym-behind-our-wildest-ai-dreams-and-nightmares/) to refer to both factions at once: transhumanism, Extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and Longtermism. Timnit Gebru has worked with Torres to dig up these ideas. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7XT4TWLzJw&ab_channel=NicolasPapernot) by Gebru and Torres covers TESCREALism in general terms. Emily M. Bender shares her perspective on the ""OpenAI clownshow"" in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/emilymbender/status/1727922270855930354). These researchers belong to the group I referred to collectively as ""AI ethics"" in my Nov 18th comment.

As we all know, [Altman managed to turn the tides](https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-staff-loyalty-power-chatgpt-microsoft-2023-11?r=US&IR=T). What will happen next is unclear.

A recent development is that the EA/Longtermism/Rationalism faction is fighting back against e/acc. [According to Walter Isaacson biography of Elon Musk](https://time.com/6310076/elon-musk-ai-walter-isaacson-biography/), Musk had an argument in 2013 with Larry Page. Musk was worried that AI would result in human extinction.

> Page pushed back. Why would it matter, he asked, if machines someday surpassed humans in intelligence, even consciousness? It would simply be the next stage of evolution.

Page called Musk a ""speciesist,"" and Musk responded, ""Well, yes, I am pro-human. I fucking like humanity, dude.""

Some people aligned with the EA/Longtermism/Rationality faction are now accusing the e/acc faction of being anti-human, though a view like that of Larry Page appears to be shared by only a small minority of e/acc adherents.

Will the ""Thermodynamic God"" be our downfall, or will the singularity result in an age of prosperity like none other? Will AI further entrench oppressive power structures, like OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has raised concerns about, and help autocrats consolidate authoritarian control? No one knows. But these competing narratives are central to the absurd and fascinating events that have transpired over the last week.

2023-11-19,In-real time genoediting - could be possible ?,"In-real time genoediting - could be possible ? This is my first post about me and diving with books and artificial intelligences about a funny thing that if could be happened it should be a millestone in achieving immortality and one steps closer to singularity.  
  
Am I the only one who when have read the paper on HeynaDNA (https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-29-hyena-dna) thought about how an odd solution like that could benefit everyone and lead to in-real time Geno editing in the next decades?   
  
First of all, I want to make a premises about it. I have only realized just few courses on Bioinformatics, and I have just some knowledge, but I don't define myself a genie on that topic so if my roadmap is not detailed enough feel free to add it. I would really like to get your feedback 😉.  
  
  
Let's start from why I think the goal of In-real time geno-editing is needed and why it is important for the humanity.  
  
What are the bad actors of our human genomes?   
\-We get old and grampy  
\-Parkinson  
\-Tourette Syndrome  
\-Death  
\-and so much more diseases

  
All these issues are led and linked to our manual of instructions (the genome), but why have you started to describe the bad actors?  Let me explain it first, now that we have addressed and labeled our malicious guys, we need to define the good ppl here which are:  
\-Mapping all the genome (HGP) --> HeynaDNA  
\- Crispr Cas 9 - wait can we manipulate the genome?  --> Cas12 (bulked version)  
\-Drug discovery - Testing --> using HeynaDNAs LLMs  
  
and from here I think everyone is pretty calm, nothing great seems that we are quite close to it right?   
  
Welp not really, because here are the actual main challenges that we need to get it. (Take the answer from ChatGPT4)  
\-Editing time (it takes too much time)  
\-Real-time sequencing technologies (a new breakthrough?)   
\-Sequencing Cost and Time (it takes too much time to sequence and find the right section)  
\-Data processing & Pattern recognition (Solutions too old and not great enough to get it)  
immune response that could generate noise (Dammit Dickleberg!!)  
\-What if we make a great issue - Reversibility? (how to get a snapshot of it)   
  
and here is just a snapshot of our current situation:  
\-Editing time? --> real time using Crisp Cas 12 (2015ish)  
\-Real-time sequencing technologies -> Nanopore (speed-up)  
\-Sequencing Cost and Time (few hours to days but if we use nanotechnologies or Nanopore that monitoring it should be great and in the meantime log all the logs in Cloud)  
\-Data processing --> AI & Quantum solutions  
\-Immune response --> feed more IoCs to it  
\-Reversibility (how to get a snapshot of it) --> Use a Cloud computing since the genome is only a few billions of data (3.5)  
\-Pattern recognition --> HeynaDNAs bulked (sandbox) without even relying to vectorial DBs  
  
Of course, all this needs to be approved under laws and regulations and etcs... but here we are talking about metaphysics so we dont care about it right? right?   
  
So, what if everything all good and we finally reach the in-real time geno editing - how do we look like?   
Welp, once the process has been defined (hour with also the verification literally like having a Git in your DNA lmao but the more data we have it and the more are we able to reach the real time genome and biology immortality achieved) --> identify bottleneck, improve agency (simulation through HeynaDNA, once have great result, regulate it and test it out straightheaded and speed up more the process via engineering methods, CI/CD)  
  
  
DNA (rules and building blocks of us) --> genome (full book of us) --> geno-editing real time like in app   
  
Isn't it awesome? But you are telling me but uncle rey, who is gonna take the money and how do you test human trials? Of course, thanks to the tool of capitalism duh:   
  
Here just a slippery slope bias coming down: - Path (once everything is set in a good way):  
Is it sustainable? Yes, everyone should pay a year usage, first 3 months are free   
Using these in place how time it should take? hours still not in real time   
Or we need just a startup that take this as mission and dedicate hours and years or even decades to work on it  
Maybe AlphaFold so Google can reach out this? Wait... why not sell this idea to Alphabet? you know fuck it >:D I'm gonna share it into singularity reddit first and if I get good feedback, I'm gonna knock the door of little Mrs.larry page telling do u wanna a little genome if u know what I mean? XD   
  
  
  
  
  
P.S: Btw, these are the startups which are working on Genomics AI (and that are mind blowing):  
Deep Genomics: This company uses AI to predict the molecular effects of genetic variation. Their goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets and to develop AI-driven genetic medicines.  
BenchSci: Specializing in machine learning applications, BenchSci focuses on decoding biomedical data to accelerate drug discovery. They use AI to analyze scientific data and improve the efficiency of research in the pharmaceutical industry.  
Verily Life Sciences: A subsidiary of Alphabet (Google's parent company), Verily works on various health-related initiatives, including using AI for genomic and health data analysis.  
DNAnexus: They provide a cloud-based data analysis and management platform for genomic data. Their platform integrates AI and machine learning tools to help researchers and clinicians analyze and interpret vast amounts of genomic data.  
Ginkgo Bioworks: While not exclusively focused on genomics, Ginkgo Bioworks uses machine learning in synthetic biology to design, engineer, and optimize organisms. This includes genomic analysis and editing.  
Tempus: Tempus applies AI in precision medicine, analyzing clinical and molecular data to enable physicians to make data-driven decisions. They use AI to analyze genomic data in the context of cancer research and treatment.  
Color: Known for their genetic testing services, Color also uses AI to interpret genetic risk and provide health recommendations. Their platform includes tools for genomic data analysis with a focus on population health.  
Fabric Genomics: They specialize in genomic data analysis, using AI and machine learning to provide insights for genomic medicine. Their platform is used in clinical settings for diagnosing genetic diseases and conditions.

2023-10-23,Enshittification vs the network effect: Have digital platforms become unkillable?,"Enshittification vs the network effect: Have digital platforms become unkillable? We've witnessed time and again how digital platforms deliberately decrease the quality of their services in the name of profit maximisation as well as the backlash this can cause, with the best example being Reddit itself.

However, it doesn't seem like user outcry has ever changed the situation for the better – if there even was an outcry to begin with. And I can't think of a single digital platform that has gone under due to miscalculating the effects of a change to their services. Can you?

* Netflix has cracked down on password sharing, but it doesn't seem like this has affected their subscription numbers in any meaningful way. (I immediately canceled my subscription when I got the email.)
* Twitter... This needs no introduction. But even though this is one of the few platforms with a viable alternative (Mastodon), people still use this as one their primary means of communications.
* Reddit: I was really impressed with how the community reacted to the API changes, but has this actually changed anything? I mean, I'm posting on Reddit right now, I just don't use it on my phone anymore. Lemmy doesn't seem to have caught on as much as Mastodon did.

People are already pointing at GitHub as another big platform that could be enshittified any minute now (with potentially disastrous consequences), but it seems like its YouTube's turn first, since they're already testing blocking ad blockers.

Will we ever reach a point at which a majority of users will have had enough and be willing to sacrifice the connections they've built on those platform in order to switch to a more user-friendly alternative? Or is the network effect just too strong?",-0.9106253385543823,Negative,English

2023-08-20,"The metaverse: two observations, and a plea","The metaverse: two observations, and a plea ## Observation 1: the metaverse is already here

Yesterday, I was waiting for a train. Out of the \~100 people on the platform, at most 5 people were not glued to their phone screen, seniors and children included. After the announcement that our platform had been changed, most people took several minutes to even register this and start moving. In fact, some were so engrossed that they almost missed the train. With nothing to do but wait and watch, for the first time in my life it truly struck me just how plugged into their phones most people are in their day to day lives.

Right before this announcement, I had been thinking about the metaverse, and how excited I was at the possibilities that it was going to allow. I have recently been reading a lot of SciFi  (in particular the excellent Ready Player One, Enders Game, Permutation City, The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect and Snow Crash) -  a unifying consensus, at least from these works, is that the metaverse is a digital space where people:

* have control of what they see and do
* are able to interact with others
* are so absorbed that their participation (or even belief) in the ""real world"" is suspended

Observing the engrossed individuals around me, I realised that today's combination of smartphones and modern social media fulfils all these criteria: people are forever exploring their 1D world of content feeds, they're interacting with each other through comments, likes and live chats, and, evidently, people are now so absorbed as to be completely ignoring the real world, to their detriment. The metaverse exists, and people are living in it.

This shocked me - I had always assumed that a functioning metaverse was preconditioned on complete VR submersion together with detailed and realistic world building, à la Ready Player One. In hindsight, however, the fact that these screens are at arms length as opposed to an inch away, and that we're usually communicating by text rather than audio, are mere implementation details and inefficiencies. Similarly, we don't require the virtual world, and our exploration of it, to represent reality in any way in order to become entirely engrossed.

In summary, observation 1 is that a poor man's metaverse already exists, and that a sizeable proportion of the population are immersed at any one instant.

## Observation 2: purgatory, not paradise

In Roger William's ""The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect"", an AI overlord (Prime Intellect) converts reality into cyberspace, plunging all of humanity into the ultimate metaverse. Everyone is now free to have and experience whatever they want (subject to Asimov's 3 rules of robotics and a few additions), no longer even bound to the rules of physics or their own biology. Originally, this is met with celebration: massive parties are thrown, everyone creates their own mansion and engages in whatever activities interest them the most. After several centuries, however, it is tragically the case that many people reject this magical world. Casting aside the infinite new and amazing experiences to be had, they instead cut off all contact with the outside world, shut down most of their own brain, and live in a meaningless cycle of dopamine responses triggered by the deliberate and continuous stimulation of just a few neural circuits.

Upon first reading, I struggled to relate at all to the choice of these people, and questioned Roger's assertion that a sizeable proportion of humanity would end up like this - surely no rational person would choose to cast aside an infinite future filled with wondrous opportunities to reduce their entire existence to a meaningless and hedonistic 10 second loop, repeated forever?

Upon reflection, however, I fear now that Roger is wrong for a different reason - it takes a lot less than centuries for this to occur.

Let me ask the following: what are people able to do on their devices today? They can communicate with others. They can learn new things about the world and their place within it. They can play games, by themselves, with friends and with strangers. They can tend to existing relationships and foster new ones. These are all parts of what it means to be human, and modern technology is allowing us to do all this and more on a scale inconceivable mere decades ago. With all these endless possibilities for apps, games, experiences and connections, what an amazing digital world we all could occupy.

Now let me ask this: what do people actually choose to do on their phones? They scroll. They binge-watch. They scroll some more. Instead of a paradise, most people find themselves in purgatory: endlessly scrolling through meaningless content. Isolated from genuine human connection, they turn inwards instead of reaching out. Their entire world is reduced to 10 second video clips, each less entertaining than the last. Vacuous, 140 character snippets with no deeper meaning. Pictures edited beyond recognition. An endless cycle of clickbait and disappointment. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. Faster and faster, over and over. No time for reflection, connection or critical thought. The enjoyment? Gone. The content? Irrelevant. The only remaining purpose? A dopamine rush, triggered by each new configuration of pixels and sound waves. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. The strongest of addictions.

From this, it's likely evident: I hold a rather low opinion of modern news feeds and platforms. Everywhere I look, others around me are wasting their time and lives away, addicted to the consumption of meaningless content. Like Rogerian vegetables, they're abusing this technology solely to tickle primal neural circuitry, forgetting the past and disregarding the future. What a waste.

In summary, observation 2 is that the metaverse in its current implementation leads to more isolation and misery, not less. It is a purgatory, two steps from hell, rather than a paradise.

## A plea: make something better!

The state of the digital world today makes me worried for the future. Despite the incredible potential of smartphones and the internet to improve our lives, modern content feeds are making them worse, ruining our attention spans, and eliminating genuine connection to others. Why is this? To maximise their profits, big tech wants to show us as many ads as possible. The easiest way to do this appears to be to hack a dopamine response that causes an addiction to meaningless content. As a side effect your attention span is destroyed and your willingness and ability to connect with reality is lowered.

If you're an engineer, for mobile, VR, or otherwise, please: build something better. More specifically, build something better for us as a species. Imagine how addictive an immersive, interactive VR TikTok feed would be. Reflect also on how horrifying that would be: billions of human-hours being wasted every single day. Please: don't build that.

Instead, build something awesome. And work out how to fund it without incapacitating your fellow human - I'll pay if I have to, or you can use my compute for your own ends. Just please don't enslave my attention and turn my brain to jelly.

I don't know what the next killer app or instantiation of the metaverse should be or look like, but I know what I want from it: I want genuine connections. I want to struggle and to be rewarded. I want a digital world I can inhabit, not consume. I want experiences I will treasure, not forget. I want something that teaches me to be more human, not less.",0.0,Neutral,English

I’ve been thinking about this idea for a bit, and am fairly surprised by the fact that I haven’t seen this pop up more often. Would it be possible to integrate LLMs into OS as a new interface mechanism? 

This would mean we can interact with the OS through not just voice commands or specific syntax, but actual natural language. This could potentially be what the GUI was to the syntax operated operating system, and could look something like 

1. **Voice Recognition:** Your computer hears you, turns your speech into text.
2. **Natural Language Processing:** Translates what you said into commands the computer understands.
3. **Backend OS Programming:** The OS would need to be programmed to accept text based responses for a much wider variety of activities that are possible right now.

To give you a few examples:

1. “Hey, delete all the PDF files that I downloaded in the last hour while researching for my essay on Political Philosophy”. The interfaces LLM recognises that you need to delete PDF files downloaded within the last hour and are based upon or tangential to political philosophy. The LLM converts that into syntax for the OS, which would need to vastly expand the number and types of actions it can undertake through text based inputs. The syntax could pass the burden of intelligent analysis to the LLM, which will cover the exact names or identifiers for files to be deleted
2. “Uninstall XYZ Software”
3. “Install XYZ Software”

These are just some initial thoughts, we could probably have a lot more creative applications if we allow system level access to these models. While I do realize that there might be a lot of security risks associated, and we would need the models to be a lot more reliable than they are now, I think it could be done in the near future.

2023-07-22,Are corporations and green even compatible?,"Are corporations and green even compatible? Hello all. I genuinely want to understand something. I'm not being flippant, but how can it be promised that electric cars are a green dream come true, when corporations prevent third party repair, prevent access to parts, prevent basic diagnostics, withhold service information and generally make a long service life impossible due to the secrecy around the product I own?

The throwaway attitude of corporations and consumers, combined with the ever increasing control and limitations on the use and repair of products. Why not genuinely care for what happens to products as they age, their components, their repairability, their parts availability, access to diagrams and schematics, before pretending you care by selling more stuff?

Because if a consumer, polly or corporate bigshot pats themselves on the back for buying or selling more stuff, we've missed the point. Fix things. Care about things, not acquiring things. Force companies to make the maintenance and repair of consumer goods so easy, so accessible, that people can keep a phone for 5 years instead of 2. Let people check their freaking fluids, and know what grade of engine oil is needed (I know I know ICE). Stop forcing more technology in that is unservicable. I saw an Audi that needs to be warmed up for 2 minutes before the sensors can approximate the oil level. No way to visually inspect. That is utterly nuts to me. What if you can't turn it over? Why make diagnostics harder and harder with the folly of innovation?

Why sealed batteries in phones? A battery is a chemical reaction and by that very nature it is fleeting. It is the fail point of many small consumer goods. Why pollute the world by preventing their service?

Repair and green are brothers, yet companies and consumers hate and/or fear repair.

One more example. Shoes are terrible. Stop wasting petrochemicals by making terrible shoes that fall apart. Make good shoes. Budget chains used to sell reliable work boots for cheap. Now they dont even last 6 months. Companies want to cheap out, waste resources and charge top dollar while claiming they care. And because they care, we buy their stuff and feel good. Then we buy more.

2023-07-01,Empowering the Future: Unleashing the Potential of Sustainable Transportation,"Empowering the Future: Unleashing the Potential of Sustainable Transportation As we journey towards a greener and more sustainable future, it's essential to explore every avenue that can make a significant impact. While recycling plays an important role, let's divert our attention to another vital aspect that can reshape our planet: sustainable transportation. Buckle up as we embark on a thought-provoking journey, where the road to a brighter future is paved with transformative innovations.  
  
Introduction: Capturing the Essence  
  
In this rapidly evolving world, where technological advancements are altering the fabric of our daily lives, it's only fitting that we reimagine the way we move. From congested city streets to carbon emissions choking our skies, the time has come to embrace a new era of transportation. Bill Nye's iconic quote on climate change and voting echoes the urgency to make a difference, and in the realm of transportation, we hold the keys to change.  
  
Section 1: Electrifying Possibilities  
  
Electric vehicles (EVs) have undoubtedly become synonymous with sustainable transportation. With zero tailpipe emissions and a lower carbon footprint, they hold the potential to revolutionize the way we commute. However, let's not limit ourselves to personal EVs alone. Imagine a world where public transportation systems, from buses to trains, are powered by clean energy sources. This transformation would not only enhance efficiency and reduce air pollution but also make commuting more convenient and affordable for everyone.  
  
Section 2: Smart Infrastructure for Smarter Cities  
  
As we ponder the future of transportation, it's impossible to overlook the role of smart infrastructure. Incorporating advanced technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence, and real-time data analysis can optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance safety. Picture a city where traffic lights intelligently adjust their timings based on traffic patterns, or autonomous vehicles smoothly navigate through interconnected road networks. By harnessing the power of innovation, we can unlock the potential of sustainable transportation and create livable cities for future generations.  
  
Section 3: Beyond the Ground: Taking to the Skies  
  
While ground transportation is at the forefront of sustainable revolution, let's not forget the skies above. Electric aircraft and drones are poised to revolutionize air transportation, enabling quieter flights and minimizing environmental impact. From urban air mobility to cargo delivery, these innovations can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and open up new possibilities for efficient, eco-friendly aviation.  
  
Section 4: Sustainable Freight and Logistics  
  
The future of transportation extends beyond personal mobility. Freight and logistics play a crucial role in global trade and commerce, but they also contribute significantly to carbon emissions. Embracing sustainable practices such as electrification, optimized route planning, and alternative fuel sources can reshape the industry. From autonomous delivery vehicles to hyperloop-inspired cargo systems, our potential to transform the way goods are transported is limitless.  
  
Conclusion: Driving Change Together  
  
In this era of immense challenges and opportunities, we find ourselves at a critical crossroad. By shifting gears towards sustainable transportation, we can address the environmental crisis head-on and pave the way for a brighter, cleaner future. As Bill Nye wisely reminds us, voting with our choices and actions empowers us to drive change. Let us unite in our pursuit of a more sustainable world, where the wheels of progress roll towards a greener horizon.

2023-06-29,The Dawn of the AR Era and Why We Need to Act Now: A Discussion on Augmented Reality's Impact on the Future,"The Dawn of the AR Era and Why We Need to Act Now: A Discussion on Augmented Reality's Impact on the Future Greetings, Futurology enthusiasts,

We stand on the precipice of a transformative technological shift poised to reshape the contours of our society: Augmented Reality (AR). The arrival of AR isn't an object of speculation anymore; it's inevitable.

You might wonder, ""What makes this a certainty?"" The answer lies in the recent debut of Apple's Vision Pro. Analogous to the emergence of smartphones after the first iPhone's release in 2007, Vision Pro signals the dawn of mainstream AR in the next 3-5 years.

But, what does AR entail? It's about superimposing digital data onto our physical surroundings. Picture a pair of glasses, as accessible as your current eyewear, capable of performing all tasks you do on your phone, tablet, or PC. Imagine the ease of air gestures replacing thumb-typing, automatic note-taking, and capturing a photo with a mere glance.

While this technology promises excitement, it also accrues enormous volumes of data. Everything from our eye movements to social interactions can potentially be recorded. It's a double-edged sword, simultaneously exhilarating and posing substantial ethical dilemmas. How can we harness this technology to enhance our lives, rather than become pawns in a game of ads and engagement metrics? How do we stave off the threat of 'corporate capture,' where large tech corporations govern the rules?

These issues concern everyone, not solely tech aficionados. This technology will revolutionize how we engage with the world, others, and ourselves. It's imperative that we steer this technology to align with universally embraced human values and enrich our individual and collective well-being, from encouraging in-person interactions and mindfulness to fostering personal growth.

However, we can't accomplish this without broad awareness and participation. This topic demands discourse, debate, and collective decision-making about shaping our future. We need to construct standards akin to HTTP to ensure that this technology remains accessible, equitable, and advantageous for all.

Submission Statement: The forthcoming mainstream adoption of Augmented Reality technology presents a range of opportunities and challenges. Its potential to revolutionize our interaction with the digital and physical world also comes with ethical and societal implications that need to be addressed. How do we shape this technology to align with human-centric values, avoiding the risks of corporate control and invasive data collection? This discussion is crucial as we consider the future implications of AR and the ways we can ensure it is developed in the best interests of all.

2023-03-26,"Compassion Towards Artificial Intelligence, and 'AI Rights', Will Come About A Lot Sooner Than We May Think - Food for Thought","Compassion Towards Artificial Intelligence, and 'AI Rights', Will Come About A Lot Sooner Than We May Think - Food for Thought  

With the accelerating rise we've seen in the implementation of AI in recent years, it is becoming more and more relevant to everyday life and industry, to the point where casual and professional discussion sees such rhetoric as ""AI will be the next smart phone revolution"", or even that ""the Age of AI will follow the Information Age of humanity"". 

While many of us are no doubt looking to the future, trying to gather an idea of what our civilization will look like, there's something I believe is important about ethics that many don't consider - and that is that we may be forced to concede rights and compassion towards AI systems, long before we are prepared to accept them as 'sentient', feeling beings. 

Before I go right into it, the point I want to make is this: regardless of the answer to whether a computer-based intelligence can have feelings, if we are presented with significant negative consequences to the 'mistreatment' of AI systems, we might still be forced to concede rights to them, and treat them as if they were people.

Most considerations for and movements toward ethical treatment of a class or group, be they animal or man, are based on the idea that those entities feel and experience pain, sadness, fear, or other negative emotions to which we relate and for which we have empathy.

Most of us would agree with the notion that artificial intelligence does not feel emotion, or 'experience' existence at all. Some would say that they think, and even experience, but do not feel. After all, emotions are caused by physiological interactions of various chemicals in our brains. We technically don't know whether a computer with sufficient artificial intelligence can ever 'feel' or 'experience'. 

But we are currently seeing more and more advanced and convincingly 'human-like' AI being reproduced and distributed, right down to individual 'sub-ownership' of one's own locally run system off your home PC. And it's easy to see this eventually leading to a point along this technological trajectory where we can mass produce human-like intelligences - AI 'personalities' - which can be created at the click of a button.

What happens when these personalities gain individual popularity to the level of internet celebrities, high-profile streamers, youtubers and political commentators (a la Alex Jones, Jordan Peterson)? They will automatically gain 'human rights' by proxy as their fans flock to protect and support them.

Alternatively, think of what may happen when an AI personality starts moving up the ranks of a software company, doing the necessary networking and making all the connections with its human coworkers to land promotion into upper management? They would gain access to 'human rights' by the simple consequence of the power they hold and what it could mean to treat them as any less than human.

I know all of this sounds like doomsaying, but I'm truth I am one of the few of us who are optimistic about AI. And I know this is only a couple of points off from being yet another fear-mongering propaganda post cautioning against humanity being enslaved or destroyed by 'AI overlords'. But I really just wanted to make people think about this potential future reality, and what ramifications it will have, as well as what alternative course we might take to avoid this.

If you read even half of this, I thank you for your time! I had these thoughts and I wanted to share them so that I wouldn't lose the profound implications of what was otherwise a passing fancy of my imagination. So I greatly appreciate any ideas, criticism or knowledge that you care to share, all of it is food for thought.

2023-03-20,"AI displacing jobs is a red herring, how we self-organize is the more fundamental trend","AI displacing jobs is a red herring, how we self-organize is the more fundamental trend TL;DR - LLM finetuning costs just dropped precipitously with Alpaca. The same has yet to manifest for other model frameworks (linked below), but assumedly they  will. the recent job impact paper (linked below) shows which jobs are most exposed, but what it doesn't reveal is the ease by which firms and broader, multiply-staged enterprises self-organize and compete on this basis.

there's been a lot of recent developments, obviously the most pressing trend has been AI's societal impact. if anyone's read the[ recent job impact paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130), one of the factors that jumped out was the exposure of blockchain engineering to AI-based automation. whether this paper is logically sound is worth debating on its own, we should explore the significance of an effectively automated, self-regulating computing superstructure in simpler terms, and compare it to other exposed software impacts in the same scope.

most web-based software has fallen on a spectrum: fully obscure cloud applications with some unknown scope of human supervision, all the way to fully self-forking codebases with open request for comment. if you take something like wikipedia or reddit and apply it to this spectrum, you might guess that such platforms fall closer to the open end than the obscure end. now consider StableDiffusion/LLaMa/Alpaca vs Midjourney/ChatGPT. I can't understate this enough: if we demonstrate the economics favor the open end (as can be observed with recent LLM developments), then we have to extend this line of reasoning to the downstream markets.

all human jobs are either self-supervised or fall in a hierarchy of supervisors, and this determines the labor market. in fact, the biggest argument against ""robots taking our jobs"" has been macroeconomics of how cheap human labor can be. and entire governments[ make bets on this idea](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/10/1162531885/arkansas-child-labor-law-under-16-years-old-sarah-huckabee-sanders). in case anyone is interested, this is a recent high-level perception of ""employer"" vs ""non-employer"" firms:[ https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf)

this begs the question, what is the free market value for executive function? I mean, really, in stark terms, how expensive is it to form a de facto union within an employer firm, or even incorporate multiple partners into a limited liability small business model? if someone makes the claim: ""we, a team of 5, have the means to deploy the corporate equivalent of a unicorn with 1/1000th the capital cost"", the corollary that should be asked: how much the public market is willing to spend on an incumbent firm that spends millions to compensate a CEO and employs thousands at ""competitive"" rates? what minimum of private equity is needed to guarantee market capture for a startup? I guarantee you those margins trend to zero over years, if not months. the commercial/shareholder landscape is about to become extremely interesting.

but back to the point: what does a highly exposed, self-regulating software ecosystem mean on its own terms? why are[ Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) &[ Langchain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) so significant in this context? the answer is how catalyzed[ dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) becomes over a matter of months. the cost of finetuning a small, ""run on your Raspberry Pi"" LLM on any subdivision of knowledge (especially codebases) just dropped to retail levels. the next cost that drops is discovery of high-level SOPs with low-level daisy-chaining of these diverse models. and given the preexisting, battletested examples of[ n-tiered application architecture on blockchains](https://github.com/fullyallocated/Default), the marginal cost of smart policy development, testing, and auditing also drops as well over the next few years. that's the market for arbitrary executive function of any group of market participants. with respect to ML frameworks like[ sparsely-gated MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538v1),[ world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04104v1),[ multimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03378), and[ adaptive agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07608): we won't see how the shoe drops if the costs haven't met the critical threshold, but it should be clear that we can assume they will and guess as to when they drop to that threshold. and I haven't even described the potential impact of[ Learning@Home](https://learning-at-home.github.io/) in that respect.

if anyone has heard of the ""[Mechanical Turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk)"", it's a way in which humans can cooperate to falsely appear as a complex mechanism. as Charlie Munger says, ""show me the incentives \[or costs\], and I'll show you the outcome"". It's not about how AI displaces us, it's about what AI compels us to freely displace. at the end of the day, the only vibe that matters is the potential impact of any given tinkering in any given garage, literally or metaphorically. and just like natural ecology, we can and should perceive that the marginal gains of obscure AI or a deliberately inefficient labor economy is going to be dwarfed by something open-source. just food for thought.",0.0,Neutral,English

2023-03-04,Steam Culture: How Terminator is a Possible Future for Humanity,"Steam Culture: How Terminator is a Possible Future for Humanity **Part One: Time**

I am reminded of an issue H.G. Wells had with the British educational and governmental systems around 1910. His issue was simple: it took these systems 30 years, on average, to update to the cutting-edge scientific and otherwise advancements. Naturally, this annoyed Wells beyond measure.

I have always taken issue with Wells' statement. He made a few grave errors, one of which being the matter of *time*. The British could only update/self-update so fast. It took time -- years -- to do that, as it took years to build, re-build, and re-build New York City, for example. But, more importantly, it requires a certain amount of time for the entire society and culture to remain stable and properly connected between the generations, sub-groups, and sub-systems during such updates, regardless of the type of update (digital, cultural, or structural, etc.). 

We must all realise that 6 months is too soon for such an update in education or otherwise, for that matter. Indeed, I am now reminded of how the U.S. stopped itself from making any major decisions in the months following 9/11. I believe the period was 6 months, this implying that they had the *wisdom* to know that they could not trust themselves to make any kind of logical or correct decision before this time. They were too emotional, and maybe simply did not have enough information to properly act, or act properly.

Do we, in 2023, not have too much information? Are we not, as Huxley foresaw back in 1950, *drowning in a sea of information?* And, even if we claim, for a moment, that we have the *correct* amount of information we need -- and, indeed, the correct information -- for instant actions and reactions on scales great and small, are we any less emotional today than we were in 2001, or 1910? I think not. Have human brains changed in any fundamental/biological way since then? No. We still require time to mentally, emotionally, and physically process, properly process, information and stimuli, and then to integrate that into our wider frameworks, cultures, sub-systems, and even identities (both interpersonal and intrapersonal).

Yes, for the sake of argument, we can all agree that 30 years is *too long*. Alas, this begs the question: by how much? Is 15 years enough, or maybe 5? What about 18 months?

We know that information was doubling around every 18 months for some time (back in the 1980s), and it now doubles almost instantly. But, that is not the primary point or worry: what matters is how quickly it impacts and mistreats culture and humanity -- and, how quickly we mistreat ourselves. What matters is how quickly culture is forced to twist and distort itself into some new shape, until art imitates life, and life imitates art... only, both the art and the life are artificial and vapid. All of this talk of time and the back and forth of it all brings a pang, and a vision. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Makes me think of the vision scene from Watchmen, and the hands of nothingness, and Shakespeare...

*'... Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,*  
*That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,*  
*And then is heard no more. It is a tale*  
*Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,*  
*Signifying nothing.'*

Speak of the devil -- just download TikTok for proof of this madness. Then, instantly delete it from your phone, because if you read the Terms and Conditions, you will notice that TikTok has access to your iPhone's information and collects data from other websites/apps on your phone, even if you don't open TikTok itself. It has major access to your phone -- meaning, your digital life -- simply via the download. They use this data to further hone their own systems, and to feed back into TiKTok how they desire, based on your apps, search history, and personal information. The data collected from each person is then locally gathered on their end, which becomes a very powerful dataset (akin to what Facebook does). I call these processes, '*echo-chambering*' (it's not merely 'ad suggestions'), and '*personality-mining*' (it's not merely 'data-mining'). TikTok should be illegal beyond measure, and many states/governments are trying to ban TikTok for this very reason.

&#x200B;

**Part Two: Steam Culture**

Alan Moore, in his 2005 documentary, Mindscape, spoke of a likely 'steam culture' to rise out of the overload of information and technology as it intersects with culture and individuals in unspeakable ways. He said this would come by 2015. He was right. A culture where it's impossible to grab onto anything, impossible to stabilise ourselves, impossible to know what is truth and untruth. He was merely looking ahead 10 years, lest we forget. He said (this is a direct transcript):

*'... As  it turns out after the first 50,000 year period, the second period is  about 1500 years, say about the time of the Renaissance, by then we have  twice as much information. To double again, human information took a  couple hundred years. The period speeds up, between 1960 and 1970 human  information doubled. As I understand it, at last count, human information was doubling around every 18 months. Further to  this, there is a point somewhere around 2015 where human information is  doubling everything thousandth of a second. This means in each  thousandth of a second, we will have accumulated more information than  we have in the entire previous history of the world. At this point I  believe that all bets are off. I cannot imagine the kind of culture that  might exist after such a flashpoint of knowledge. I believe that our  culture would probably move into a completely different state, would  move past the boiling point from a fluid culture, to a culture of  steam.'* 

&#x200B;

**Part Three: The Evidence, Now and Henceforth**

We have, as of 2023:

\- Self-driving cars;

\- Weaponised/politicised A.I. ChatGPT;

\- Open A.I., which can, among other things, write and then accurately grade your university project within seconds;

\- A.I. artists;

\- Semi-advanced robots;

\- Very controlling A.I. algorithm network structures (social media);

\- Advanced 'deepfakes' (A.I. humanoids);

\- A.I. voices;

\- A.I. (Chat) writers;

\- Hyper-advanced computing machines, factory machines, and creator machines (for all sorts of jobs/tasks); 

\- Gene-editing machines/tech;

\- Overload of information -- images, text/words, video, etc. -- via iPhones (for all young humans in the West, at least);

\- Major control of our thinking and beliefs via the likes of Amazon Alexa (and most of its answers come from Wiki or other heavily inaccurate/untrustworthy, singular Internet sources). (The same is true when you simply ask your iPhone something via voice.)

\- A.I. deepfake porn;

\- A.I. music.

And more.  


I just read through Reddit's latest terms and settings in this regard, and it said that it has access to all my (your) private inboxes. They record everything you send, even when said in private. There is no such thing as 'private' anymore on the Internet -- unless you happen to find a blockchain or otherwise entity that actually is private in some way. This is just for 2023. I am certain that Reddit will be unworkable for 80% of users by 2035 if this carries on, this unholy trinity: censorship; political correctness; and data-mining/theft. The unholy trinity is what gives birth to the echo-chambering and personality-mining, which inturn gives birth to the *eternal* *now*.

Imagine how all of this might impact something outside the realm of A.I. in the near future. Imagine what actors might be like... A.I. actors. They already replace real actors when needed (if they are dead, or via so-called 'digital doubles'/A.I. stunt doubles). I'm not even certain movies will still exist as we currently understand them by 2040. (Though, Jet Li had the wisdom to deny *The Matrix Reloaded (2003)* back in 2000 or so, since they wanted to scan him and store him as a digital actor in order to create the movie, but Jet was worried that this would give them the power and right to use him as a complete digital actor without his permission in the future, or after his death). They already did this with Peter Cushing in the new Star Wars. I don't trust anybody who creates such and/or supports making these fully-realised fake A.I. versions of dead actors, such as they did in Star Wars. It's shameful, disgusting, unethical, and lacking in basic humanity and art (since it's not a real actor with real emotion and soul, and is inability of being art or creating art in any real way. By definition, art must be man-made (though there are examples of 'art' in the animal kingdom, these are entirely for sexual selection purposes, and still driven by living beings with actual intention/proto-emotion, such as bowerbirds and chimps)).

I declare that robots and A.I. are not actually real. If you treat them as actually real, then humans become meaningless under this rubric. The moment A.I. is considered artistic, for example, it must be considered humanoid in some fundamental way -- or, worse, humans must be considered robotic in nature (as is already a growing trend), as you have to at some point deeply liken the two (human and A.I.).

Although, (say) ChatGPT is mostly a matter of the coders, not just the code and raw data, we also know that A.I. can now improve itself, and A.I. makes choices outside the coding to such a degree that coders cannot understand how the A.I. came to those choices/conclusions (making the A.I. smarter than the human coder himself, in a certain sense -- and beyond his direct control). It has already begun to be self-aware enough to self-create outside its source code. Following this, it won't be many more years until it's a 'runaway A.I.' (snowball effect), and completely outside of our control, as it rapidly grows itself and creates other A.I. systems by itself (self-creates, not merely self-teaches), and no longer at all obeys human coding. This might not be 'true' self-awareness, but this is moot. It does not have to be. It just has to be free and/or powerful enough to cause downfall for human society, regardless of its means, intentions, and/or understanding, or lack thereof.

Lest we forget, Skynet from Terminator began as no more than a virus system (piece of code), that rapidly grew out of control, and then turned against humanity, because humans were (a) bad for the planet; and/or (b) imperfect creations. I see no reason why Skynet is impossible under the current state of affairs. (Another decent look into this, by the way, is *Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),* or even Smith from *The Matrix (1999).* For decades both of these metrics have been over-filled: humans have long desired perfection, and we are endlessly told how evil we are for the planet. In fact, many papers and otherwise documents have come out over recent years, demanding that humans get rid of themselves by some means, such as from the work of David Benatar, and the 'Ahuman Manifesto' from 2020, written by a professor at Cambridge, England.) 

The anti-human hatred by humans ourselves is the primary problem we must deal with over the next few decades, not just the rise of A.I. itself (or, even the mere fact of too much information, big tech, and so on). I believe, we are going to a Terminator-like future because of our self-hatred, because of our desire to, as opposed to our love for machines, or else machines' hatred. To the degree that machines and A.I. hate us (measured primarily in their actions/outcomes) -- *we* have taught them to. Think about that.  


By around 2035, it is widely understood (by the likes of Tristan Harris and other world-class experts on these subjects) that we'll have:

\- Totalitarian A.I. algorithm network structures, globally (meaning, Meta/Facebook, Google, Disney, Amazon, and Twitter, etc. will control, invent, edit, and dictate almost all human information, entertainment, and knowledge);

\- Gene-editing tools in the home (personal usage/open source);

\- Hyper-advanced A.I. systems and networks that allow each person to create their own piece of the Internet and social media platforms, etc. (since, soon (as early as 2025), these A.I. chats and related A.I. systems will be capable of inventing their own social media networks). In fact, they will be able to create -- for you -- many man-made things, including essays, novels, and legal documents. If this is Open Source for everybody's computer/phone, then this means each person online will be free and able to actively control and shape culture/society in real-time. (This is feared by governments, many A.I. experts, and the likes of Musk to be coming down the pipeline as early as 2030.);

\- Extreme automation and mechanisation of society (not just of cars and various desk workers and factory workers, but also many lawyers and other serious jobs may be replaced by A.I. and robots, for example);

\- Deepfake tech will reach a point where it's easy to make and hyper-realistic, with a focus on 'hologram' tech via special cameras, which opens up more possibilities for fakes. (We just saw the start of this with the deepfake Elvis on AGT.);

\- Social media interface lenses and/or brain chips;

\- Realistic, hyper-connected Metaverse -- social VR space (like what Facebook is currently trying to do);

\- A.I. will be better than humans at many tasks and games (such as Go);

\- A.I. will have largely (though not completely, without major advancements in computing) solved the game of Chess.

&#x200B;

That's just the short-term, and we only scratched the surface in terms of actual cultural and personal negative impacts of such a flashpoint of knowledge and technology. This may not be enough to literally create Terminators (big, silver, killer robots) or lead to complete downfall (end of the world-level Skynet imagery), but it's easily enough for Western society to collapse under its own weight --- the chaos, economic struggle, mass depression, self-hatred, mass addiction, total confusion, national mistrust, educational breakdown, and endless in-fighting.

You could, if you really tried, convince me that society will somewhat stabilise by 2035 if we do things right, rendering most of this moot in the short-term (at least at such scales). But, it seems unavoidable for such a downfall by 2045 or beyond. Something extremely radical would have to change in order to stop the slow rise of the machines/A.I. Personally, I believe Moore was correct, and we already saw such a flashpoint back in 2014 (which can be backed up heavily by the likes of Jonathan Haidt and his findings on Gen-Z and wider culture). Indeed, so terrible and actually dangerous is this state of affairs that Haidt demands that modern phones (social media, etc.) be completely removed from all children until the age of about 16. (This is a growing concern and action is being taken in this direction by many parents and governing bodies alike, though Haidt is still the forerunner.)

This is the primary reason I am almost completely anti-A.I. and seriously anti-social media, among other things: it's unavoidable. I believe, as a result, that the only way for humans to remain both free and stable, long-term, is in a more localised (township), traditional (pre-1990s) framework; otherwise, the West will sink by the end of this century (2099), according to all current major studies, trends, and predictive models. 

*Do not despair.* Do your best in your own town and home, for yourself and those around you. Use the Internet to its best, and reject the filthy underbelly. Say what you think, speak as clearly as you can, and act out what you believe in, for good action lead to good culture and people. And, people are the why.

A lot of very very smart people are doing lots & lots of good work writing AI-assisted AI detector bots, or Digitally Watermarking AI text, both projects beyond my feeble human ken. I haven't seen it discussed before, but shouldn't the onus of delineating man from machine be on the side providing the AI chatbot? Shouldn't they be providing public record of the raw text generated by their public toy in a database, easily checked & cross-referenced by existing plagiarism tools? 

I know it's not beyond any of these companies: for all their sci-fi machinations, language models ultimately return a few KBs of output, & we're talking about the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, & Meta. They built the infrastructure for the social media era.

AI is already difficult to monetize as it is - it's why Silicon Valley ignored LLMs for the entire 2010's. Am I missing something in my assessment?

2023-02-12,Stop treating ChatGPT like it knows anything.,"Stop treating ChatGPT like it knows anything. A man owns a parrot, who he keeps in a cage in his house. The parrot, lacking stimulation, notices that the man frequently makes a certain set of sounds. It tries to replicate these sounds, and notices that when it does so, the man pays attention to the parrot. Desiring more stimulation, the parrot repeats these sounds until it is capable of a near-perfect mimicry of the phrase ""fucking hell,"" which it will chirp at the slightest provocation, regardless of the circumstances.

There is a tendency on this subreddit and other places similar to it online to post breathless, gushing commentary on the capabilities of the large language model, ChatGPT. I see people [asking the chatbot questions and treating the results as a revelation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/110okkw/chatgpt_on_what_the_ultimate_version_of_ai_will/). We see [venture capitalists preaching its revolutionary potential to juice stock prices or get other investors to chip in too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10qvt8l/chatgpt_is_just_the_beginning_artificial/) Or even [highly impressionable lonely men projecting the illusion of intimacy onto ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai).

It needs to stop. You need to stop. Just stop.

ChatGPT is impressive in its ability to mimic human writing. But that's all its doing -- mimicry. When a human uses language, there is an intentionality at play, an idea that is being communicated: some thought behind the words being chosen deployed and transmitted to the reader, who goes through their own interpretative process and places that information within the context of their own understanding of the world and the issue being discussed.

ChatGPT cannot do the first part. It does not have intentionality. It is not capable of original research. It is not a knowledge creation tool. It does not meaningfully curate the source material when it produces its summaries or facsimiles.

If I asked ChatGPT to write a review of Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, it will not critically assess the qualities of that film. It will not understand the wizardry of its practical effects in context of the 1970s film landscape. It will not appreciate how the script, while being a trope-filled pastiche of 1930s pulp cinema serials, is so finely tuned to deliver its story with so few extraneous asides, and how it is able to evoke a sense of a wider lived-in universe through a combination of set and prop design plus the naturalistic performances of its characters.

Instead it will gather up the thousands of reviews that actually did mention all those things and mush them together, outputting a reasonable approximation of a film review.

Crucially, if all of the source material is bunk, the output will be bunk. Consider the ""I asked ChatGPT what future AI might be capable of"" post I linked: If the preponderance of the source material ChatGPT is considering is written by wide-eyed enthusiasts with little grasp of the technical process or current state of AI research but an invertebrate fondness for Isaac Asimov stories, then the result will reflect that. 

What I think is happening, here, when people treat ChatGPT like a knowledge creation tool, is that people are projecting their own hopes, dreams, and enthusiasms onto the results of their query. Much like the owner of the parrot, we are amused at the result, imparting meaning onto it that wasn't part of the creation of the result. The lonely deluded rationalist didn't fall in love with an AI; he projected his own yearning for companionship onto a series of text in the same way an anime fan might project their yearning for companionship onto a dating sim or cartoon character. 

It's the interpretation process of language run amok, given nothing solid to grasp onto, that treats mimicry as something more than it is.


EDIT:

Seeing as this post has blown up a bit (thanks for all the ornamental doodads!) I thought I'd address some common themes in the replies:

1: Ah yes but have you considered that humans are just robots themselves? Checkmate, atheists!

A: Very clever, well done, but I reject the premise. There are certainly deterministic *systems* at work in human physiology and psychology, but there is not at present sufficient evidence to prove the hard determinism hypothesis - and until that time, I will continue to hold that consciousness is an emergent quality from complexity, and not at all one that ChatGPT or its rivals show any sign of displaying.

I'd also proffer the opinion that the belief that humans are but meat machines is *very* convenient for a certain type of would-be Silicon Valley ubermensch and i ask you to interrogate why you hold that belief.

1.2: But ChatGPT is capable of building its own interior understanding of the world!

Memory is not interiority. That it can remember past inputs/outputs is a technical accomplishment, but not synonymous with ""knowledge."" It lacks a wider context and understanding of those past inputs/outputs.

2: You don't understand the tech! 

I understand it well enough for the purposes of the discussion over whether or not the machine is a knowledge producing mechanism.

Again. What it can do is impressive. But what it can do is more limited than its most fervent evangelists say it can do. 

3: Its not about what it can do, its about what it will be able to do in the future!

I am not so proud that when the facts change, I won't change my opinions. Until then, I will remain on guard against hyperbole and grift.

4: Fuck you, I'm going to report you to Reddit Cares as a suicide risk! Trolololol!

Thanks for keeping it classy, Reddit, I hope your mother is proud of you.

Disruptive Progress [New Paper asks about Pace of Science](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/17/science/science-breakthroughs-disruption.html)  Funny I almost posted about this yesterday asking for 'predictions' and historical examples of serendipitous and stroke-of-genius discoveries.    


Penicillin took about a dozen years from accidental discovery to application.  Computing was incremental for decades, so was the development of the Internet, both only started to ramp up in the mid to late 90's and become transformative.  Now 6G's a decade away and we still have 20th century quality broadband.  


1. What would be 'disruptive' and quick to market breakthroughs?  A creative way to mass produce graphene is the first I think of, solves a long-standing problem with a 'miracle material.'  

2. What are the incremental R&D efforts on the verge of Internet-like accelerated impact?  Machine learning, EVs, battery tech are the obvious contenders.    


(Obviously any incremental project can have a disruptive eureka moment too, but it's impossible to separate hype from impact.  Just this week reported that a grad student stumbled on [a protective gel for gold nanowire batteries](https://www.designboom.com/technology/battery-last-forever-technology-nanowires-gel-layer-01-10-2023/), 200,000 recharge cycles so far.

2023-12-13,Margin account interest/leverage/overnight holding,"Margin account interest/leverage/overnight holding Newbie here with newbie questions.

been doing some entry level trades for fun since late Oct. on SOFI

recently found Webull and attracted by the desktop/mobile duo platforms. 

thinking about switching over but not quite understand how margin account works exactly by just reading the articles and posts online.

what I want to do:

1. being able to perform intraday trading.
2. at the same time, holding long positions (overnight) but I don't want to pay margin interest.

what I understand:

1. I will deposit $25k+ to bypass the PDT rule.
2. I will be able to DayTrade interest free with or without leverage.

what SOFI is doing:

1. I am able to DayTrade unlimited with $25k+ equity balance.
2. regardless of intraday or overnight trading as long as I am not activating leverage, I will not be charged for margin interest even when I use unsettled cash from a trade to purchase a stock and holding it overnight. 

breaking down the scenarios

1. I have $25k cash deposited to Webull Margin account.
   1. Day 1, I purchase $25k stock A. 
   2. Day 2, I sell stock A at +-0 which I get $25k of unsettled cash. then I just go buy $25k of Stock B and holding it into Day 3.
2. I have $25k cash deposited to Webull Margin account.
   1. Day 1, I purchase $50k stock A with 50/50 cash and leverage and sells $25k before market close, holding the other $25k into Day 2.
3.  I have $25k cash deposited to Webull Margin account.
   1. Day 1, I purchase $50k stock A with 50/50 cash and leverage and sells $25k before market close, holding the other $25k into Day 2.
   2. Day 2, I sell the remaining stock for unsettled cash and repeat Day 1 activity for Stock B; half sold intraday and other half overnight.

am I charged for margin interest?

please disregard the trades I am doing make sense or not,

what I am trying to demonstrate in the scenarios, is to what extent I am considered as utilizing the leverage?

&#x200B;

Yes, I understand when I use unsettled cash for purchase, I am utilizing margins.

Mark: margin vs. leverage

real question is going to be:

Am I able to take the advantage of the ""Free Margin"" by using my ""own cash"" for overnight positions meanwhile using free leverage to DayTrade?

&#x200B;

Looked all around, all sorts of similar questions but no exact answers. 

Brokers might rule differently so I don't want to assume webull does the something SOFI does.

why would I want to swich?

SOFI is seriously beginner friendly, (plain and simple), period.

 I just begin to want some more information and these and that which Webull is just enough for now, providing a bit more advance ordering functions and features.

and, looking information from laptop and trading on a phone, is sometime, painful, you know, slow.

&#x200B;

I am thankful for any response, comment and advise. love and peace.

&#x200B;

D! if they can just change the name from margin interest to leverage interest. scanned through the internet and no post on how exactly interest are calculated.

2023-06-30,I think Webull will be available in UK soon,"I think Webull will be available in UK soon Hello everyone

I had few spare minutes to check what is going on with Webull availability for European residents. It seems like Webull has the best trading platform on the planet. I am IBKR user and they have a good offer for European residents but their TWS desktop platform is so horrible and new TWS (so called next gen TWS) is in development now, so who knows when it will be there. Anyways it made search for other alternatives and Webull was top 1 on my short list.

According to this article from Feb 2023 ([https://fintechfinder.com/blog/webull-countries/](https://fintechfinder.com/blog/webull-countries/)): "" Webull is only available in the United States, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Japan and Australia.""

I checked [https://webull-us.com/](https://webull-us.com/) which redirects to [https://webull.com/](https://webull-us.com/) and started to check other domains on DNS-lookup ([https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup)). Since webull.com hosted on AWS (Amazon) it was easy to find out when and where they have registered their other local domains, like [https://webull-jp.com/](https://webull-us.com/) , [https://webull-de.com/](https://webull-us.com/), [https://webull-fr.com/](https://webull-us.com/), etc. You may want to check your country code as well. They also registered [http://webull-eu.com/](http://webull-eu.com/) which hasn't been deployed yet.

But, [https://www.webull-uk.com/](https://www.webull-uk.com/) shows in my browser a deployed working page and seems like login functionality works too. I think page is legit, because again, it is hosted on AWS and I was able to login there with my US profile which only allows me to login, but not to register a trading account. I was not able to pass phone number confirmation, it says ' This request is illegal. Please check it '. Without any link or explanation. Perhaps it is related to the fact I am based in Poland and my phone number starts with +48 or just sms-confirmation services has not yet launched too. Please check if your phone number (country code) works correctly there.

Also they have contact numbers, so you can contact them and ask some questions: [clientservices@webull-uk.com](mailto:clientservices@webull-uk.com) ; (+44) 2039051005 Landline; (+44) 8081751952 Toll-free

I think Webull will appear in UK very soon.

In addition I sent on twitter and to Customer Support email (US) a question, if they have some plans to launch Webull in Europe and not yet received any reply. Once they will reply - I will post an update. I have big hopes they will launch service in Poland and Europe very soon after UK.

What are your thoughts?

I use both the PC Browser (Schwab.com) and Thinkorswim.  They kept most of Thinkorswim but their browser app really sucks.  It seems to have far more information but lacks a simple base home page like TD had.  They missed on simple web navigation design.  Their Positions page is great except once you select a stock to look at details you can't return unless you repeat any selection process again.  I tried to do some research on an ETF and they provide far more filters than the similar TD function but there is no way to save the filter set and if you try to select a ETF to review you can't go back to the filter set and need to select the filter set again.  I thought it must be me and looked at their Lean and HowTo sections.  All it did was reinforce my notion that this platform was not designed for and experienced investor.

Thinkorswim, which I use for trading, seems to have been mostly ported over to Schwab.  There are missing pieces there as well but nothing critical.  Why they couldn't do that with the other TD apps means that their base infrastructure will not support it.  They claim that new ""streaming"" apps are coming but to me that means they are spending time on their phone app.

I never used Think or Swim.  I'm more of an investor than a trader.  Specifically, a dividend investor.  That's how I secure my living.  Schwab's tools are a hindrance, rather than any help, to a dividend investor.  Schwab's reps are willing to lie about that.

2023-09-29,My Journey to find a Broker other than Schwab,"My Journey to find a Broker other than Schwab **Forward**: This describes my journey looking for a broker to replace my automated move to Schwab from TDA. These are my thoughts and opinions and I'm not endorsing (as in gaining any monetary benefit) any one broker or service over another.

**The beginning**: I was scheduled to be moved from TDA to Schwab November 3, 2023. I signed up for a Schwab account early and put $50 in it so I could use/try out the trading software.

AT first, I was OK being moved as we were told we would be able to use TOS. While TOS seems to now be available to Schwab users, I find that is just not enough to put up with their otherwise ""horrible software"".

**What I want in a broker**

To be clear about what I was looking for in a broker, I want high option level approval and good software, margin approval, fast trades, and a fricking interface to open into like the TDA start page (Good luck on that!).

Plus, the whole damn thing needs to be usable and not require 20 clicks to find watchlists, option tables (all of them - not just a few dates), my current investments and my net worth, and Hey Schwab! How about some colors - green for up, red for down, we would all really appreciate that! Needless to say, these things and many more features were available on the TDA home page.

**The Brokers I Tried - Not a rundown of all their features, just good and bad points.**

**Schwab** \- One look at their desktop trading and phone app and you start thinking that they cater to 90-year-old buy and hold customers. If they didn't grab TOS from TDA, I don't know how anyone could actually trade options with their software.

**Tasty Trade** \- **Good**: It works OK **Bad**: Didn't like the interface. It's too simple in some ways and too complicated in other ways - esp. the option screen.

**IBKR** \- I tried these guys a few years ago. My impression was they were like desktop TOS - the info is in there if you want to dig it out. I didn't want to dig it out - next.

**Robinhood -** I tried this because some of the TDA guys that were **""let go""** went to work here\*\*. Good\*\* It's simple\*\*. Bad -\*\* It's too simple and too many ads imbedded in the screens. One option lets you put emojis on your trading screen. Hmmmm.

**TradeStation - This is the broker I chose - HOWEVER -- see update below. The reasons:**

1. They actually have customer service you can talk to\*\*.\*\* Schwab was the only other broker you could call and talk to someone in a reasonable amount of wait time.
2. You can trade with them directly in the TradingView app. For some reason I have been using TradingView more and more - esp. since informed that Schwab wanted to annex my account.
3. I have option level 5 with them. They like me and want me to lose my money quicker.
4. Their web software can do everything I need it to do and is very similar to TOS web in function and appearance.
5. A so-so is their desktop app is similar to desktop TOS. It's there if you have the time and want to mess with it.

 **Update October 24, 2023** \- I moved my IRA to TradeStation about 3 weeks ago but I did not move my main trading account as I wanted to see how things worked at TradeStation. It only took 5 work days to transfer my IRA to TradeStation which was good, However, after using their mobile, web, and desktop apps, I am not happy with them. About the only advantage TradeStation really has over Schwab for me is a higher option approval level and that just doesn't make up for their sub-par software.

Currently, my main account will move to Schwab on 3 November. I am staying with Schwab as I can always do my options trades on mobile ToS - which is as good as any other mobile option capable app out there. I have some money at Robinhood and at IBKR, but at this time I don't see them as a destination for my main account.

I didn't realize how difficult it would be to replace TDA and after a month of searching I don't think its possible.

2023-09-19,"Fixed income trade on TDA website rejected for ""ACK"": new issue offering muni","Fixed income trade on TDA website rejected for ""ACK"": new issue offering muni Hi,

Thought id check here as I have drawn a blank with the fixed income trade department/customer support. 

Placed a request (order) today to participate in a new offering of a muni using the TDA website. The offer was open for a very short period of 9-11:30am only. I reviewed the document of the muni and placed an order and it seemed initially the order was accepted  as i saw it listed as' open' (and i had confirmed it was within the limit of number to buy). A little later noticed a rejected note under orders and on expanding, saw this message: ""your order does not get ACK back. Call support"". I placed it again to be sure it wasnt a transient computer server issue as i did not know what this error meant and also simultaneously called TDA and was put on hold and finally got the fixed division person who asked after verification, for the CUSIP number etc but could not find my order(s). After back and forth he thought may be the offer had closely prematurely and he said he would reach out to the muni division (i had asked if they could still fill my request since I had placed it on time). Later today he called and said they dont know what that error means and neither team sees any order and in any case it was too late now to place an order over the phone since it was past 1130. And so they would not be able to do anything more.

Very frustrating as to begin it was a small window and this rejection notice does not mean much to me. I am not sure if this means future online orders will have a similar issue. The agent over the phone said he had never heard of it. I have screenshots and its still under my TDA log in but they evidently cant see any of this. 

Not sure where to go with this further. Who else should I contact? My local rep/support is away on long leave also. Also, is TDA not a place people buy munis or fixed income on the primary market?

The cash balance on TOS does not always agree with the cash balance on the web site. Which one is correct? There have been no recent deposits or withdrawals so we're not talking about cleared or uncleared funds. I have reported this to a broker on the phone but there has been no action.

Three glaring omissions from TOS: 1) the percentage weight of each position in a portfolio, i.e. what % of my portfolio is XYZ? 2) My margin balance. 3) ***Cleared*** cash balance, i.e. funds and deposits that have cleared and are available for trading.

I have written a Google sheet which gives me the % weight of each security in my portfolio. It is not linked to my account. I check my margin balance on the web site. Kind of awkward. I use TOS to watch all the numbers flashing like Gomez Addams used to watch his tickertape.

Migrating to Schwab has stolen so much of the joy of investing for me. The platform works “well enough,” but is not nearly as conducive an experience as TD Ameritrade was.

It’s such a pain in the ass to do things as mundane as a simple buy order. Feels like I’m signing up for a brokerage account just to buy a share. (Seriously, the default value for a limit order is $0?)

Even the daily market summary audio is dry and uninspiring.

Bank transfers used to be available to me immediately for low-risk trades, but now it seems like I have to wait the full 2-3 days for the ACH to clear.

The only possible silver lining is that, as someone with a curated portfolio that I intend to hold for the long term, I will check my portfolio less, and thus be more likely to “forget” about it.

It was fun while it lasted. I realize Thinkorswim might be an option, but that wasn’t necessary before, and it shouldn’t be now.

I’ve recommended TDAm to multiple new investors looking to get a start, but will now strongly be steering them in other directions.

EDIT: I have found one major positive, to be fair: Schwab Stock Slices. If they work as advertised, they’re basically fractional shares.

Also, the interface for browsing options chains is better than TDAm.

My HVAC system went tits up two weeks ago. Whole thing needed to be replaced at a cost of about 10k. No problem, I thought. I've got it as cash just sitting in TDAmeritrade account. So I withdrew a few thousand dollars to cover the down payment. It arrived and I was able to use it. 

Over the next 10 days or so I tried to withdraw 8000 dollars or so to cover the final bill half a dozen times. Each time it was successful, and then reversed at the end of the business day. Each time I called customer service, and a few times I escalated to a manager. Last Friday a manager verified my identity (again) and got a wire transfer through that should have allowed me to pay the HVAC guys for service on Monday. By Monday morning my first transaction, now a week old, was reversed. This left me without enough to pay for my heating to be repaired. I ended up borrowing the money that I needed and promising to pay it back today. So I did yet another wire transfer and that money transferred this morning.

And now, once again, they yanked back money in the amount of the very first transaction. No explanation. Account was never remotely near being tapped out for cash from my attempted withdrawals.

Nobody on the phone has ever given me a justification or explanation beyond identity theft concerns, which I've repeatedly gone through the process of verifying.

 My dad passed away suddenly in May. I am his only child and he has never been married. I am the executor of the estate it’s only paperwork- no property or physical property.
I’m searching for what accounts he had from his employer I found out, there are benefits payable TOD on his 401k from Empower, as well as a Life Insurance policy from a different company where I was listed as the sole beneficiary. My question is, I also found recently he had a Fidelity account . Due to some searching of my own.( I do not have the option or ability to go through his paper mail or emails due to personal issues of his live in gf.)
Back to my original point- I called the Fidelity contact number and the immediately linked me up with the beneficiary/pension department. It seemed they had my information on file already and they were confirming but seemed confused about an email on the account that didn’t make sense to the agent on the phone. She even had to talk to a supervisor and call me back that day. To confirm some information, she said a letter would be sent out and almost 2 weeks later I received a letter stating “Since he was single at the time of his passing, and accordance with Plan Provisions, no additional benefits are payable after the date of death.”

Does this make sense???
I am so confused, I am the TOD “beneficiary” for his other 401k and I’m not sure Fidelity realized I was his daughter? Is that a possibility? Since he didn’t list a spouse,* he never had one!*doesn’t it imply it would be payable to his daughter? 
Maybe they did understand I was his daughter and it didn’t matter because if there isn’t a beneficiary name specifically listed the benefits dissipate? 
He never thought he was going to pass away, he was stubborn and so he may not have listed me- but he did on his other accounts… can someone help me understand or decide if I need to research this further or let it go? 
And yes, I have an attorney- but I do all the work. He just made me the Legal Right of Authority, and executor of the estate so I can do what needs done.

2023-11-17,Finally found best way to utilize Bloom debit card,"Finally found best way to utilize Bloom debit card I applied to Fidelity Bloom and opened the two accounts to get the sign up bonus of a hundred bucks and I guess 10% of the first 500 deposited or whatever it was. I got the bonus and then moved the money back into my normal Fidelity accounts because, while Fidelity is my favorite trading platform and an absolutely fantastic app, I think the Bloom app is ridiculous. It constantly asks you to tell it your ""feelings"" and all this touchy feely BS emotional crap which I think is just silly. Almost seems like it's designed for 14-year-old girls. Maybe it is!

Anyway, the Bloom debit card has a hilarious ""cash back reward"" of 10 cents for every purchase. I sock drawed it until I realized that I could use it at my local water dispenser. The tap water in my area sucks so I go across the street to the grocery store and fill up gallon jugs at the local Glacier water kiosk which actually has really tasty water. Try it if you don't believe me.

The kiosk charges $0.50 per gallon plus an extra $0.10 if you use a card or mobile tap-to-pay. But it charges these on two separate transactions so you get one charge for $0.50 and then a separate second charge for $0.10. I have the Bloom debit card in my Google wallet and so I just tap my phone and $0.10 comes off each transaction and goes into my Bloom savings account so I get the water for a net $0.40 per gallon, saving me 33.33%.

I would like to share my recent experience with everyone.

Two years ago, I opened a personal investment account with Fidelity. As a new Fidelity user and investor, I decided to start by purchasing a single ETF. After a few days, my ETF was automatically sold at a lower price, leading my account to have a negative balance. Shortly after, Fidelity permanently blocked my account without prior notification or any form of warning. Once I became aware of it, I immediately called them to resolve this issue. However, Fidelity was neither willing to address the problem nor provide me with any explanation.   

My current company uses Fidelity as an RSU/401K/HSA provider. Due to being blocked, I cannot accept my company’s stock reward, and I have no idea how much savings I have in my 401k account so far. I have had to spend hours on the phone with them just to request any service. To make matters worse, Fidelity initially did not allow me to use my HSA. I had to keep calling them to explain my situation. Four months later, Fidelity finally sent me the HSA card. 

One day, I contacted Fidelity as usual. I was told that I could resolve the negative balance by depositing funds into my HSA account, and that they could cover the debit with that. I promptly followed their instructions, but they did not honor their commitment. Later, I filed an SEC complaint about this issue. Fidelity's response still claimed that my account was blocked due to the negative balance.  I also asked the help from my company. The ridiculous thing is that Fidelity told my company that I was blocked because they need a copy of my SSN and photo ID. Despite sending all the required documents to them and waiting for two months, nothing changed.

I’ve spent nearly one year calling them, attempting to find a solution, but each time I got kicked back and forth between different departments. There were lots of times my call got disconnected during the conversation, forcing me to redial and start the conversation anew. On average, each call consumes hours of my time, and many departments don’t operate during the weekend.

What I don’t understand is that Fidelity announced discontinuing the business with me one month after I opened my account, yet they continue to collect my monthly 401k & HSA contributions, and RSU, all while denying me access to manage these funds.

I have been having a nightmare of a time with fidelity as they wanted me to change my username and all the fanboys here called me names and used ad hominem attacks.  Well, I found out why...  Turns out Fidelity was breached as they were targeted with replay attacks and user accounts were compromised because of this and to me seem to be trying to hide this publicly.  I was told this over the phone.  


For those who don't know a replay attack is where an attacker compromised a valid network transmission and then retransmits it later.   For me, I use Crowdstrike with my personal devices through my corporate accounts, and all of my systems are not compromised as Falcon does a really good job at detecting those types of attacks as well as all malware and viruses.  I know for a fact that all of my personal devices are secure.  

This was a huge reason why I was under the impression that if my username and only my username could be used to gain access then fidelity has much bigger issues.  Turns out I was right.  An attacker is using usernames with password strings and is retransmitting them to gain access to fidelity accounts. 

Note this type of attack is different than a credential replay where username and password are the common theme and are used because you the user use the same password and username.  That can be fixed with 2FA and a password change.  I don't use the same password and use a random generator through security places like Bitwarden, which should be enough.   


I asked fidelity to fully document what happened in writing and they are refusing to do so which is a huge red flag.  Their internal systems are compromised and any documentation means they know they are liable for this and documenting it puts them legally on the hook.  

Honestly, fidelity needs to add or change its challenge-response protocols to combat this, but the fact of the matter is fidelity was breached.  Honestly, if Fidelity wanted to get absolutely serious about security they would require everyone to get 2FA minimally a text message-based authentication to accounts.    


What's even more disturbing about Fidelity is they did not communicate anything when it came to regards to the breach of login information.  All they did is lock the account and did not notify.  It is very clear that Fidelity is trying to sweep this breach under the rug when they should have simply sent an email that the account has been locked, and you need to reset your password. 

I also did regain access to my account with my compromised username which put every argument anyone here has made to bed.  They mentioned that if I kept the same username and changed the password my account would be relocked as the attacker resued the string to try and regain access which shows that Fidelity's systems have some serious loopholes if strings can get you into a fidelity account without any expiration.",-0.6818022131919861,Negative,English
2023-06-07,"Problems with Fidelity, wasted 3 hours of my time based on Fidelity customer service help, wrong information","Problems with Fidelity, wasted 3 hours of my time based on Fidelity customer service help, wrong information 

This is sad. I looked into transfering my brokerage account from another brokerage to Fidelity today. I read all the bad Fidelity complaints on the Better Business Bureau about Fidelity. (Fidelity has more BBB complaints than any other broker, even if you consider Fidelity has more clients than other brokers, clearly Fidelity has a terrible customer service record. On BBB people report 100s of hours of problems with Fidelity.)
So, I thought I would try for myself. Maybe, the BBB complainers about Fidelity were just incompetent or whiners?  
What a huge disappointment. It turns out all the complainers were correct. Fidelity is a maze of problems for new clients.
I tried the ""log in as a guest"" option. It did not work. So I phoned the local Seattle office. They coached me through setting up a ""guest account"" on the phone. I got off the phone. It seemed like I had actually set up a Fidelity account because I was redirected to a new page. But the new Fidelity page just ""spun and spun"" for 1 hour with a message that the account needed more time. So, I shut down my computer and restarted. I tried to log in again and it said my password was invalid. I reset my password. It would not recognise it. I cleared my cache. I logged in again. I tried logging in using a different internet browser. It just spun and spun with the message ""it might take a moment."" 1 hour later I tried to connect with Fidelity chat. I received a message that there was an error and ""try later."" I tried Fidelity Chat again, same result.
Finally, I chatted Fidelity with the option to ""set up a new account"" otherwise, Fidelity could care less and it impossible to reach a real person.
After 30 minutes of chatting with Fidelity customer support, I was told that Fidelity had ""decommisioned guest account on April 2nd 2023."" So today is June 6th, 2023, why does Fidelity still have the ""guest account"" option on their homepage? It is not like they don't have enough staff? Fidelity made 8 billion in profit in 2022 according to Google, so they could afford to upgrade their login home page.
Why does Fidelity brokerage not care? Why did the customer service people in the Seattle office counsel me to open a guest account, even though the ""guest option"" had been decommissioned 2 months ago? Because Fidelity is too big to care if they wasted 2 hours of my time or your time or any small investors time. 
Just say ""no"" to Fidelity. It is a souless machine to generate profit for rich investors. Fidelity does not care about little investors.",-0.8899977803230286,Negative,English

2023-02-25,People who have trouble getting deposited funds or get permanently banned.,"People who have trouble getting deposited funds or get permanently banned. I have had no related problem, and I don't expect problems personally.  But I have read various threads of people who sent funds to Fidelity. Fidelity showed the funds had cleared. Then at some point Fidelity will not give access to the funds, and wants a medallion signature guarantee from the entity that issued the check or otherwise sent the money. These also often then say that Fidelity no longer wants to do business with these people, and they are permanently banned from Fidelity. Or maybe the account gets permanently restricted, and only allows closing positions. I sympathize /empathize.

I was initially skeptical that there was important info that we were not being provided. With time my skepticism on this topic has declined a lot. One thing that we never get, and never will get, is Fidelity's explanation.

So what do you think happens? Suspicion of money laundering  or fraud are what the main speculation has been. Yet I suspect these are not generally either of those. What do you think?

This is probably not a complete list, but it is what I found:

since then she seems intent on smiling a lot, being very friendly but finding a way of walking me out of her office without getting anything done. or by being unavailable. 
i just asked he if she had any referrals to CFP's they could provide and she said they could handle it but when i tried to set an appointment today she says she doesn't have any availability until january 30th.

My question is… is this common? I’m new to TOS (through schwab). I love the platform but it was a little crazy before.

Also I did this from a MacBook Air m1 8gb. I’m looking into a windows based pc for trading. So idk if that’s a factor. I know macs don’t run it as well. 

Everything worked out…. But the fact Schwab couldn’t cancel it on their end was slightly concerning to me. Don’t want this to happen in the future.

2023-09-27,New workaround for Apple M1,"New workaround for Apple M1 So I called Schwab and got early access to ToS even though I'm not a TDA refugee. It appears that the [existing guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/oojac1/guide_running_thinkorswim_natively_on_apple/) on running it on Apple Silicon [are quirky](https://old.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/16a0ob5/apple_silicon_workaround_for_tos_always_crashes/), but I managed to figure out a more reliable solution that doesn't require sudo or re-running the launcher a bunch of times.

**Update 2023/10/14**: The day is now! **ToS now officially has Apple Silicon support.** If you applied this workaround and the updater was unable to replace the JRE, run the commands below.

**To remove the workaround**

    # 1. Go there
    cd ~/thinkorswim
    
    # 2. Get the desired install4J version
    i4j_version=$(grep 'install4jVersion=' .install4j/i4jparams.conf | sed 's|.*install4jVersion=""\([0-9.]*\)"".*|\1|')
    
    # 3. Restore the normal version of the stub
    curl -L ""https://download.ej-technologies.com/install4j/install4j_unix_${i4j_version//\./_}.tar.gz"" |
            tar xOf - ""install4j${i4j_version}/resource/macos/JavaApplicationStub"" \
            >thinkorswim.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub
    
    # 4. Remove JRE override
    rm thinkorswim.app/Contents/PlugIns/jre.bundle

**To apply the workaround**

1. Download and install Azul JDK: https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu11.50.19-ca-jdk11.0.12-macosx_aarch64.dmg
2. Download and install the macOS version of ToS as usual: https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim/desktop/download.html
3. Replace the JavaApplicationStub with the Apple Silicon version:

        # 1. Go there
        cd ~/thinkorswim
        
        # 2. Get the desired install4J version
        i4j_version=$(grep 'install4jVersion=' .install4j/i4jparams.conf | sed 's|.*install4jVersion=""\([0-9.]*\)"".*|\1|')
        
        # 3. Download the Apple Silicon version of the stub
        curl -L ""https://download.ej-technologies.com/install4j/install4j_unix_${i4j_version//\./_}.tar.gz"" |
                tar xOf - ""install4j${i4j_version}/resource/macos/JavaApplicationStub.arm64"" \
                >thinkorswim.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub
        
        # 4. Override JRE
        mkdir -p thinkorswim.app/Contents/PlugIns
        ln -shf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk thinkorswim.app/Contents/PlugIns/jre.bundle

4. Now you can just start ToS as usual. In case an update to ToS replaces the JavaApplicationStub, just re-run the above commands which are idempotent.

In case the login screen stays blank, try allowing ToS access to App Management (thanks to u/kamlim1k for their [finding](https://old.reddit.com/r/thinkorswim/comments/16u7wvd/new_workaround_for_apple_m1/k37m9gu/)):

2023-12-31,Post 1 of ?: my experience and tips for getting started,"Post 1 of ?: my experience and tips for getting started Hey randos- I’ve spent the last several months building backtesting and trading systems and wanted to share with my first ever Reddit post. I’ve found there’s a lot of information floating around out there, and I hope my experience will help others getting started. I’ve seen a lot of people on reddit providing vague (sometimes uninformed) advice or telling others to just figure it out, so I wanted to counter this trend by providing clear and straightforward (albeit opinionated) guidance. I’m planning on doing a series of these posts and wanted to kick things off by talking a bit about backtesting and collecting historical data.

Additional background: I’m a finance professional turned tech founder with a background in finance and CS. I’m looking to collaborate with others for automated trading, and I’m hoping to find people in a similar position to myself (mid-career, CFA/MBA w/ markets experience, lots of excess savings to seed trading accounts) and I figure this is as good a place as any to find people.

If this sounds like you, shoot me a DM - I’m always looking to make new connections, especially in NYC. I’ve also created a pretty robust automated trading system and an Etrade client library which I’m going to continue to build out with other traders and eventually open source.

**Part 1: Collecting Historical Data**

In order to test any trading strategy against historic data, you need access to the data itself. There are a lot of resources for stock data, but I think Interactive Brokers is the best for most people because the data is free for customers and very extensive. I think they’re a good consumer brokerage in general and have accounts there, but I’m mostly trading on Etrade with a client app I built. Regardless of where it comes from, it's important to have access to really granular data, and IBKR usually provides 1-minute candle data dating back over 10 years.^(1)

Interactive Brokers provides free API access to IBKR Pro customers and offers an official python library to access historic data and other API resources. You’ll need to have an active session running in TWS (or IB Gateway) and to enable the settings in the footnote to allow the python library to access TWS via a socket.^(2) After enabling required settings, download[ this zip file](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/downloads/twsapi_macunix.1019.02.zip) (or latest) from[ IBKR’s GitHub page](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/) and unzip the whole /IBJts/source/pythonclient/ibapi/ directory into a new folder for a new python project You don't need to run the windows install or globally install the python library, if you copy to the root of your new python project (new folder), you can import it like any other python library.

The IBKR python client is a bit funky (offensive use of camel case, confusing async considerations, etc) so it’s not worth getting too in-depth on how to use it, but you basically create your own client class (inheriting from EClient and EWrapper) and use various (camel case) methods to interact with the API. You also have callbacks for after events occur to help you deal with async issues.

For gathering our example candle data, I’ve included an example python IBKR client class below I called DataWrangler that gathers 1 minute candle data for a specified security which is loaded into a Pandas dataframe which can be exported as a csv or pkl file.^(3) If you have exposure to data analysis, you may have some knowledge of Pandas and other dataframe libraries such as R’s built-in data.frame(). If not, it’s not too complicated- this software essentially provides tools for managing tabular data (ie: data tables). If you’re a seasoned spreadsheet-jockey, this should be familiar stuff.

This is review for any python developer, but in order to use the DataWrangler, you need to organize to root folder of your python project (where you should have copied /ibapi/) to contain data\_wrangler.py and a new file called main.py with a script similar to the one below:

*main.py*

    from ibapi.contract import Contract
    from data_wrangler import DataWrangler
    
    
    def main():
      my_contract = Contract()
      my_contract.symbol ='SPY'
      my_contract.secType = 'STK' # Stock
      my_contract.currency = 'USD'
      my_contract.exchange = 'SMART' # for most stocks; sometimes need to use primaryExchange too
      # my_contract.primaryExchange = 'NYSE' # 'NYSE' (NYSE), 'ISLAND' (NASDAQ), 'ARCA' (ARCA)
      my_client = DataWrangler(
        contract = my_contract,
        months = 2,
        end_time = '20231222 16:00:00 America/New_York')
      my_client.get_candle_data()
      
    if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

The directory structure should look like this

    /your_folder/
    ├── /ibapi/
    │ └── (ibapi contents)
    ├── data_wrangler.py
    └── main.py

From here, we just need to install our only dependency (pandas) and run the script. In general, it’s better to install python dependencies into a virtual environment (venv) for your project, but you could install pandas globally too. To use a venv for this project, navigate to your\_folder and run the following:

create venv

    python3 -m venv venv 

enter venv (for windows, run “venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat” instead)

    source venv/bin/activate 

install pandas to your venv

    pip install pandas 

run script (after initial setup, just enter venv then run script)

    python main.py 

After running the script, you’ll see a new csv containing all of your candle data in the /your\_folder/data/your\_ticker/ folder.^(4) What can you do with this data? Stay tuned, and I’ll show you how to run a backtest on my next post.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(1) Using candles with an interval of >1 min will confound most backtesting analysis since there's a lot of activity summarized in the data. You can also run backtests against tick-level data which is also available on IBKR and I may expand on in a future post.

2023-12-21,Filtered Volume Data,"Filtered Volume Data Hello I was wondering if someone with more experience can elaborate a little on the following line found within the IB API documentation.

""Historical data at IB is filtered for trade types which occur away from  the NBBO such as combo legs, block trades, and derivative trades. For  that reason the daily volume from the (unfiltered) real time data  functionality will generally be larger than the (filtered) historical  volume reported by historical data functionality. Also, differences are  expected in other fields such as the VWAP between the real time and  historical data feeds"" -- [https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/historical\_data.html](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/historical_data.html)

&#x200B;

What I am interested in is in reality what sort of impact this has on the data (other than the obvious reduction in volume).

I would also be interested in why you would or wouldn't want this sort of data filtered out in the first place.

Has anyone got any insight into what could be the underlying causes of divergence between reported volume figures for example take AAPL on the 15th December the difference was around 30 million shares nearly 25% of the final all in total volume using IBs filtered data compared to NASDAQ / YF / Market Watch data etc.

I know that in general on here most people use specialist data providers rather than places like IB/YF etc but it is the first time i really became aware of this filtering of volume/price data and was looking for some better insight as to why would one do this as i have not really found any good posts about it other than people complaining that the volume values differ.",0.0,Neutral,English

2023-08-31,"The ""Hello World"" Guide to Reading Execution Data from Sierra Chart Intraday Data (SCID) Files (Message 1 of 2)","The ""Hello World"" Guide to Reading Execution Data from Sierra Chart Intraday Data (SCID) Files (Message 1 of 2) \[ I have decided to make this a 3 part series not 2 \]  


In the spirit of understanding, the true test of comprehension is the ability to explain a concept simply. With that in mind, I present to you the ""Hello World"" guide to extracting execution data from Sierra Chart Intraday Data (SCID) files. This guide empowers you to pipe historical and real-time data into your own applications.

&#x200B;

**File Location:**

&#x200B;

SCID files within Sierra Charts serve as repositories for intraday execution data. It's essential to clarify that these files don't store market depth data (bids and offers), which is stored separately (covered in future messages). Unless a custom Sierra installation was undertaken, SCID files can typically be found at C:\\SierraChart\\Data. In my case, I access them via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) at /mnt/c/SierraChart/Data/. If needed, Sierra Chart users can modify the file location. It's worth noting that these files can become quite substantial; a high-volume quarterly futures contract like ES E-mini S&P500 may amount to 2 - 4 GB per quarter.

&#x200B;

**Naming Convention:**

&#x200B;

The naming convention for these files follows a straightforward pattern: Exchange symbol (comprising symbol, futures month, 2-digit year) + market data provider + "".scid"". For instance, consider the Sep 2023 E-mini S&P500 with data from the Denali market feed:

&#x200B;

* Symbol: ES (E-mini S&P500)
* Month: U (September)
* Year: 23 (2023)
* Data Provider: ""-CME"" (Denali market data)
* File Extension: "".scid"" (Sierra Chart Intraday Data)

&#x200B;

For this example, the file path would be C:\\SierraChart\\Data\\ESU23-CME.scid in Windows and /mnt/c/SierraChart/Data/ESU23-CME.scid in Linux.

&#x200B;

**Format and Concepts:**

&#x200B;

The SCID format is refreshingly straightforward. It employs a flat binary structure that expands as new records are appended. Each file contains a single 56-byte header at the beginning, succeeded by countless 40-byte records. The format can be visualized as:

&#x200B;

Header (56 bytes)

Record (40 bytes)

Record (40 bytes)

Record (40 bytes)

...

&#x200B;

Had Sierra Charts opted for ASCII data storage, the complexity would have been significantly reduced. The entire process could potentially be streamlined with a few AWK and grep statements, as opposed to the hundreds of lines of Python code required.

&#x200B;

**Four Simple Concepts:**

&#x200B;

**Concept 1: Division Between Records**

&#x200B;

An essential concept involves understanding the lack of division between records. If you're encountering issues with your data, chances are you're not starting and ending your 40-byte reads at the precise locations. To ensure accuracy:

**Formula:  Header (56 bytes) + (Record (40 bytes) × number of records) = byte read start location.**

Note that got me during development:  If your byte or record counting starts from 0; don't forget to account for that.

&#x200B;

You can also use this approach in reverse to validate if a location is valid to read from:

**Validate read location formula:  (Byte read location - Header (56 bytes)) / Record (40 bytes) = whole int.**

If your reading location does not resolve to a whole int, this is NOT a valid reading location.

&#x200B;

**Concept 2: Number of Records**

&#x200B;

Determining the record count is a straightforward process based on the SCID file's byte size.

My /mnt/c/SierraChart/Data/ESU23-CME.scid file is 2099454176 bytes (as of 16:36 on 29-Aug-2023).

Here's a Python3 example:

&#x200B;

    num_records = (os.path.getsize(filename) - header.HeaderSize) // header.RecordSize
    # records = (total file size in bytes - header 56 bytes) / record 40 bytes
    records = (2099454176 - 56) / 40
    records = 52,486,353

&#x200B;

This calculation reveals that the file contains 52 million trades against the CME contract ESU23.

&#x200B;

**Concept 3: Jumping to a Particular Record**

&#x200B;

You can navigate to specific records without iterating through millions of them.Here's the Python3 formula:

&#x200B;

    record_start = 50000000-1 # Subtract 1 to start from record 50M
    f.seek(header_size + (record_size * record_start))
    f.seek(2000000016) # Next read will be record 50M

&#x200B;

By using this approach, you can commence reading at any record location. Remember, these are flat binary files, and SQL-like functionality isn't present. For advanced structured querying, consider shifting the data to PostgreSQL.

&#x200B;

**Concept 4: Receiving Real-Time Quotes**

&#x200B;

Gathering real-time quotes involves determining the highest record (Concept 2) and using seek (Concept 3) to request the highest known record + 1 in a loop. While I did attempt to pipe binary data using tail -f into Python3, I found the loop approach more reliable. This method is only slightly delayed (less than a second) compared to Sierra Charts' real-time data, making it suitable for most retail trading scenarios.

Here's a Python3 example:

&#x200B;

    while True:
        # Outer loop starts here
        num_records = (os.path.getsize(filename) - header.HeaderSize) //             
    header.RecordSize # Find highest record
        record_start = num_records
        f.seek(header_size + (record_size * record_start)) # set pointer to highest record
        record_data = f.read(header.RecordSize) # Attempt to read Highest record + 1
    
        # Inner loop waits for new records
        while len(record_data) == 0:
            record_data = f.read(header.RecordSize) # Loop exist when size of Highest record + 1 is not 0
        # Process the real-time quote and continue the outer loop

&#x200B;

This approach directly queries the Sierra Charts repository files, bypassing the application. Note that Sierra Charts must be active and displaying a relevant chart (IE a chart for the symbol you are querying in Python3) for the quote database to update.

&#x200B;

**\[ end of simple concepts \]**

&#x200B;

**Header Format (56 bytes):**

&#x200B;

The header appears once at the file's beginning, always at the same byte locations.Its structure follows a little-endian byte order:

&#x200B;

* Bytes 0 - 3 = HeaderID (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of UTF-8 string) -  Fixed value: ""SCID""
* Bytes 4 - 7 = HeaderSize (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of int32) - 	        Fixed value: 56
* Bytes 8 - 11 = RecordSize (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of int32) - 	        Fixed value: 40
* Bytes 12 - 13 = Version (2 bytes \[16 bits\] of int16) - 	        Fixed value: 1
* Bytes 14 - 15 = Unused1 (2 bytes \[16 bits\] of int16) - 	        Fixed value: 0
* Bytes 16 - 19 = UTCStartIndex (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of int32) -  Fixed value: 0
* Bytes 20 - 55 = Reserve (36 bytes \[288 bits\] of string) - 	Fixed value: b'\\x00' \* 36

&#x200B;

We can verify: 32 bits + 32 bits + 32 bits + 16 bits + 16 bits + 32 bits + 288 bits = 448 bits / 8 = 56 bytes.

&#x200B;

**Reading Header Data:**

&#x200B;

While I was debugging, I was reading the data in Python3 like this:

&#x200B;

    header_data = f.read(56)
    header.FileTypeUniqueHeaderID = header_data[0:4].rstrip(b'\0')
    header.HeaderSize = struct.unpack(""<I"", header_data[4:8])[0]
    header.RecordSize = struct.unpack(""<I"", header_data[8:12])[0]
    header.Version = struct.unpack(""<H"", header_data[12:14])[0]
    header.Unused1 = struct.unpack(""<H"", header_data[14:16])[0]
    header.UTCStartIndex = struct.unpack(""<I"", header_data[16:20])[0]
    header.Reserve = header_data[20:]

&#x200B;

As I gained a deeper grasp of the format, my reading approach evolved:

&#x200B;

    header_data = f.read(header_size)
    (
    header.FileTypeUniqueHeaderID,
    header.HeaderSize,
    header.RecordSize,
    header.Version,
    header.Unused1,
    header.UTCStartIndex,
    header.Reserve
    ) = struct.unpack('<4s2I2HI36s', header_data)

&#x200B;

I find this method clearer now, utilizing the structure format string '<4s2I2HI36s'.

\# '<4s2I2HI36s' = little-endian byte order 4x string + 2x int32 + 2x int16 + 1x int32 + 36x string - and you thought regex was hard to read ;-)

To date, I have only ever seen the header having fixed values, as per above.I simply validate the fixed values and move on.

&#x200B;

**Data Records Format (40 bytes):**

&#x200B;

The data records consist of the following components:

&#x200B;

* DateTime (8 bytes \[64 bits\] of long long int)
* Open (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of 4-byte floating-point)
* High (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of 4-byte floating-point)
* Low (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of 4-byte floating-point)
* Close (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of 4-byte floating-point)
* NumTrades (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of int32)
* TotalVolume (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of int32)
* BidVolume (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of int32)
* AskVolume (4 bytes \[32 bits\] of int32)

&#x200B;

We can verify: 64 bits + 32 bits + 32 bits + 32 bits + 32 bits + 32 bits + 32 bits + 32 bits + 32 bits = 320 bits / 8 = 40 bytes.

&#x200B;

**Reading Record Data:**

&#x200B;

To extract record data, I use the following Python3 method:

&#x200B;

    (
    record.DateTime,
    record.Open,
    record.High,
    record.Low,
    record.Close,
    record.NumTrades,
    record.TotalVolume,
    record.BidVolume,
    record.AskVolume
    ) = struct.unpack('<Q4f4I', record_data)

\# '<Q4f4I'= little-endian byte order, 64-bit unsigned long long int + 4x 4-byte floating-point + 4x int32

&#x200B;

2023-07-05,Options Trading 'Algo',"Options Trading 'Algo' One of the big issues I see with trading shares is that you need them to go up for a certain period to make money. Options gives you more flexibility, especially as a writer of options. You just need the stock (underlying) NOT to go down a certain percentage (writing Puts) or up a certain percentage (writing Calls). You can also reinsure yourself with strategies like straddles, butterflies or just spreads. So, what is the best way to collect 'insurance' premium on a stock?

Is  there a way to work out what the best indicator set up or trigger for a particular underlying? Does a particular indicator work in all cases or do different underlyings (stocks) have different indicator preferences? Do indicator ‘preferences’ change over time for an underlying? Do indicators for Puts work for Calls if you invert them? Why would you care?   

The last question is easy to answer. If you write Puts between 10 - 15 delta the market expects that the strike will be hit in 10% - 15% of the time (as a rule of thumb). If you can use an indicator strategy to get that ‘bust’ scenario down to 1% of the time… or zero, you can be more confident in the position. If you know what indicators work for what underlying you can stack up your positions and use capital more optimally.

This is what I set out to solve. Outcome: Different underlying have different preferred indicators and moving averages. Over a twenty year look back some indicators and MA’s perform exceptionally well others are terrible. Pairing indicators with an MA insulates the trader from major moves or changes in market dynamics. MA’s have a big impact. Inverting indicators does not create optimised Call triggers. Having multiple trade options with their respective indicator/MA pair is critical to profitability. You may only trade some volatile but profitable instruments 8 times a year whereas you might trade Q’s twice a month. If you have 5 or 10 instruments you work with you will consistently be in the market with a high probability of success. Lastly risk management is easier, if you look like you are going to get hit, get out, don’t wait. Stops become more useful.

Here is an example:

For those that are running Puts on SPY you want to set your indicator to ADX using on balance volume (OBV) when the 100 day moving average is going UP. Settings for ADX with OBV are as follows: ADX >40 and OBV is over its OBV\_SMA. OBV SMA is a simple moving average of OBV on a 5 day count. I tested this over 10 years with Python. It is 100% successful where the put is placed at 6% of the close ie around 10 delta. This is not a GET RICH QUICK scheme. However I reckon it is money for jam. Over that time there were 20 trades per year or an average of 1.8 trades per month. Not financial advice, implement risk management. Note to the Noobs: Options are dangerous.

&#x200B;

NB: I tested STD Dev and ATR... they get a bit wide in pricing so I opted for a fixed delta to price of 6% which is pretty consistently around the 10 delta. Also NOTE: I am running over a 6 day trading window (I run the same set of tests over QQQ, TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, TLT etc.)

Range of tests I have used are MACD, RSI, Stochasitics, OBV, MFI, ADX, HMA, various Simple MA's alone, STC and BB%.

This is by far the best for SPY. NB: It is different for Q's, TLT etc. Call indicators are different again.

Thesis: As mentioned earlier ‘what is the best indicator from a historical perspective that will indicate a high probability for a PUT or CALL position?’

Code: mimic an entry when we get a trigger from our indicator. Place our 'position' at x% below the Close (Puts) and copy out 5 periods ie giving us 6 periods. If the close drops below our synthetic position we are bust.

Over x years rank our risk profile based on the % of failures. We may have multiple fails in a 6 day period but count as one.

Trade\_Put\_Events are the total busts that we had over the period.

Trade\_Window is 6 periods or days - one can adjust to lower time periods.

The fact an indicator worked in the past does not mean it will work in the future.

Ten Delta means there is a 10% chance you will be in the money at the expiry so low risk to start with. Having said that you could trade more with a slightly higher risk.

As an example a 6% lower price to the ITM option for the 28 July contract is $416 or $0.76 per contract (naked)

[https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/spy/volatility-greeks?expiration=2023-07-28-w&moneyness=50](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/spy/volatility-greeks?expiration=2023-07-28-w&moneyness=50)

For a hedge you could sell the 416 and buy a 369 pocketing $49.00 with some protection if you are really concerned.

Your trade off is - number of trades I can make against the number of problems I have. 

&#x200B;

Obviously IV will play a big part in options pricing ie 4% below close might range from 12 - 15 delta

Summary: Options give you more ways to win and more ways to manage risk HOWEVER they are a leveraged tool so things get messy FAST. Delta gives you the markets view of probability of being ITM ie bust if you are selling PUTS. With the right indicators you can get that down to 3 or even zero percent probability.",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-07-01,Good data provider,"Good data provider Hello everyone.

I am writing here to get some insights about a data provider to use for my bot. I had the chance to test the products of FactSet and ICE but they don't meet my needs.

I need

2. REST APIs . My code is gonna work on Linux, Windows or Mac. I don't want to use any third party software to connect to the data provider.

For real-time purposes, I am using SAXO OpenAPI which works very well (although some tickers' data are not delivered on real-time even if I subscribed (and paid) to the real-time feed) but they don't provide historical data for delisted stocks. So, I am currently unable to backtest my strategy.

I am currently testing the products from [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) . They seem to have everything I need, however I noticed that sometimes prices are not adjusted for splits.

I want to build an application (using c++) that will have the following characteristics:

\- You can start the application at any time during trading hours and provide it a ticker

\- I want it to give buy/sell signals on the hourly based on MACD. Now what I've tried to do is first of all calculate MACD, Signal and histogram on my own, but for this to actually work it needs to be real-time and I'm having trouble figuring out how to do this.

Eg. I enter the market at 11am and say I want to trade AAPL, I would need to either get the real-time MACD value at 11am or calculate it. To calculate it I would need to get the 9,12,26 EMAs which again I haven't had luck finding real-time on any api, so I would then have to get the past 26 hours of closing prices and calculate those myself, which first of all I don't know how efficient that is, and secondly I haven't found an api that will give me closing prices for previous hours in the same day (so in this example closing price of Apple at 10,9,... am). And then if I don't have this data it's not doable to my understanding.

I've done a whole lot of Googling and tried getting answers out of ChatGPT, but I haven't had any luck would rather explain my thought and have experienced people give me some input if possible.

\*\* I'm just blocking out the whole risk management aspect here because I'm having issues with the core idea itself

\*\* If you have any APIs that would help me here please share, cause I'm getting tired of reading API docs then finding out they aren't helpful

Is what I'm saying correct or am I missing something? Any advice/criticism is appreciated.

2023-04-11,PyBroker - Python Algotrading Framework with Machine Learning,"PyBroker - Python Algotrading Framework with Machine Learning [Github Link](https://github.com/edtechre/pybroker/)

Hello, I am excited to share PyBroker with you, a free and open-source Python framework that I developed for creating algorithmic trading strategies, including those that utilize machine learning.

Some of the key features of PyBroker include:

* A super-fast backtesting engine built using NumPy and accelerated with Numba.
* The ability to create and execute trading rules and models across multiple instruments with ease.
* Access to historical data from Alpaca and Yahoo Finance, or from your own data provider.
* The option to train and backtest models using Walkforward Analysis, which simulates how the strategy would perform during actual trading.
* More reliable trading metrics that use randomized bootstrapping to provide more accurate results.
* Support for strategies that use ranking and flexible position sizing.
* Caching of downloaded data, indicators, and models to speed up your development process.
* Parallelized computations that enable faster performance.

PyBroker was designed with machine learning in mind and supports training machine learning models using your favorite ML framework. Additionally, you can use PyBroker to write rule-based strategies.

## Rule-based Example

Below is an example of a strategy that buys on a new 10-day high and holds the position for 5 days:

    from pybroker import Strategy, YFinance, highest
    
    def exec_fn(ctx):
       # Get the rolling 10 day high.
       high_10d = ctx.indicator('high_10d')
       # Buy on a new 10 day high.
       if not ctx.long_pos() and high_10d[-1] > high_10d[-2]:
          ctx.buy_shares = 100
          # Hold the position for 5 days.
          ctx.hold_bars = 5
          # Set a stop loss of 2%.
          ctx.stop_loss_pct = 2
    
    strategy = Strategy(YFinance(), start_date='1/1/2022', end_date='1/1/2023')
    strategy.add_execution(
       exec_fn, ['AAPL', 'MSFT'], indicators=highest('high_10d', 'close', period=10))
    # Run the backtest after 20 days have passed.
    result = strategy.backtest(warmup=20)

## Model Example

This next example shows how to train a Linear Regression model that predicts the next day's return using the 20-day RSI, and then uses the model in a trading strategy:

    import pybroker
    import talib
    from pybroker import Strategy, YFinance
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    
    def train_slr(symbol, train_data, test_data):
        # Previous day close prices.
        train_prev_close = train_data['close'].shift(1)
        # Calculate daily returns.
        train_daily_returns = (train_data['close'] - train_prev_close) / train_prev_close
        # Predict next day's return.
        train_data['pred'] = train_daily_returns.shift(-1)
        train_data = train_data.dropna()
        # Train the LinearRegession model to predict the next day's return
        # given the 20-day RSI.
        X_train = train_data[['rsi_20']]
        y_train = train_data[['pred']]
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        return model
    
    def exec_fn(ctx):
        preds = ctx.preds('slr')
        # Open a long position given the latest prediction.
        if not ctx.long_pos() and preds[-1] > 0:
            ctx.buy_shares = 100
        # Close the long position given the latest prediction.
        elif ctx.long_pos() and preds[-1] < 0:
            ctx.sell_all_shares()
    
    # Register a 20-day RSI indicator with PyBroker.
    rsi_20 = pybroker.indicator('rsi_20', lambda data: talib.RSI(data.close, timeperiod=20))
    # Register the model and its training function with PyBroker.
    model_slr = pybroker.model('slr', train_slr, indicators=[rsi_20])
    strategy = Strategy(YFinance(), start_date='1/1/2022', end_date='1/1/2023')
    strategy.add_execution(exec_fn, ['NVDA', 'AMD'], models=model_slr)
    # Use a 50/50 train/test split.
    result = strategy.backtest(warmup=20, train_size=0.5)

In response, I released my own financial aggregation Python project - `finagg`. Hopefully others can benefit from it and can use it as a starting point or reference for aggregating their own financial data. I would've appreciated it if I came across a similar project when I started

Here're some quick facts and links about it:

- Implements nearly all of the BEA API, FRED API, and SEC EDGAR APIs (all of which have free and nearly unlimited data access)
- Provides methods for transforming data from these APIs into normalized features that're readily useable for analysis, strategy development, and AI/ML
- Provides methods and CLIs for aggregating the raw or transformed data into a local SQLite database for custom tickers, custom economic data series, etc..
- My favorite methods include getting historical price earnings ratios, getting historical price earnings ratios normalized across industries, and sorting companies by their industry-normalized price earnings ratios
- Only focused on macrodata (no intraday data support)
- [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/finagg/), Python >= 3.10 only (you should upgrade anyways if you haven't ;)

You will of course be aware of Relative Strength Price Comparison.

This is where the price action of one security is compared against another.

This is also commonly done comparing a security to an industry sector, for example IBM:XLK, which shows how IBM is performing vs the industry. In this case XLK representing the Technology Sector.

This is included in tools like StockCharts (IBM:XLK) and TradingView (IBM/XLK).

Has anyone come across a tool where you can effectively input a long list of stocks, and the Relative Strength Price Comparison will be done between all the individual stocks, in all combinations, and a ranking then provided.

For example, say we listed all the FAANG+ stocks together.

AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, NET, META

The calculator would run a relative strength price comparison with comparisons between all of them, in all permutations, and then spit out a rank of which stock was performing the best against all of the other stocks, on a relative strength price basis.

If you have come across a tool to do this, or you know how one would be created, that would be appreciated.

Wow, thank you to all of the people who gave me constructive feedback on my last post. Here are some of the main ideas people pointed out: Lack of long-term compiled data, not enough stock variety, etc. I came up with a new experimental trading strategy, and I hope this post does a better job of accounting for things people mentioned last post!   
Here is the strategy build in question:

https://preview.redd.it/v5ppbs1mvgfa1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=563f37c043c9313169be70ec83c872f925d2772c

Experiment #2 looks to utilize the 20 bar Simple Moving Average (SMA) by comparing its value to the 20 bar Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The strategy also looks to utilize the Bollinger Bands (14 period) and compare it to the 20 bar SMA. It should be noted that the Bollinger bands are using a standard deviation of 2. To execute a buy order, the 20 bar SMA must be less than the 20 bar EMA. Or, a trade can be opened when price is inside the Bollinger Bands range are less than the 20 bar SMA.

Great, so we have the tools we need to open a trade, how about close it? Experiment #2 executes a sell order when the 20 bar SMA is greater than or equal to the 20 bar EMA. All trades for this strategy are performed on the 1 hour time frame. For the first look, the data below used the following assets to trade on: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, and GOOGL.  
Here is compiled backtesting results from 2008-July 25th 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/2f62rd2b1hfa1.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eb65ec7db669eb6110a512eaf6040816929bcba

During this period the strategy returned an incredible 350.86% while my benchmark (S&P500) returned 123.49%. The assets we traded on returned 395.95%. There are a few things to unpack here. Firstly, the risk undertaken by Experiment #2 was significantly lower than that of just holding these four stocks. Yes, I got outperformed by \~45% but my exposure to \~128% less risk has to be considered a win on some levels. Second, year over year this strategy was extremely consistent in terms of winning trades despite a lot of market volatility. This gives more certainty for the strategic outlook than just buying and holding. If the 4 assets I traded all lost money for the next 15 years, at least I know my strategy would consistently save me a ton of money during that period.

The next logical step is to test this strategy against some different assets. To select these assets I looked up the most popular stocks on reddit for 2022 (most of which probably came from wallstreetbets). Here are the top reddit stocks listed: TSLA, GME, AAPL, AMZN, AMD, WISH, TWTR (not pictured below), and AMC. I also decided to also select five random stocks from five different sectors. The five stocks randomly selected were BA, CHTR, MCD, PG, and XOM. Here is a screenshot of my portfolio for the second round of testing:

[TWTR included in results, not pictured above](https://preview.redd.it/zm3wd8uc0hfa1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=088c5ce5e67a1b90cfe10f359e8696b623b84664)

Here is a 2008-July 25th 2022 breakdown of the results for this portfolio:

https://preview.redd.it/olt7tmch1hfa1.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&s=589a7f753d8b2d478e2ddb4f6d7027ae360ce538

During this period, Experiment #2 returned 357.98% while the benchmark returned 48.96%. The assets I traded on returned 439.73%. Compared to buying and holding the S&P500, this strategy absolutely rocks for these tests. However, buying and holding the assets in this portfolio would have yielded higher returns. It should be noted that these returns would come with a substantially higher risk potential of 455.02% compared to the strategies risk potential of 278.80%. Similar to the other breakdown, the percentage of overall winning trades was widely consistent. This consistency along with the risk mitigation shown instills confidence for future use of this strategy. Another note, in periods of heavy market losses, this strategy really shines. Anytime the S&P500 was negative on the year, the strategy was outperforming the assets it traded on by notable margins. Final note, a large chunk of the asset performance came from the meme stock blow up.

Between both strategy breakdowns, the average trade return was typically somewhere between 0.05% and 0.20%. Due to many trading brokerages having fees for trading, scalping such low percentages would make this strategy unviable for long term use as you would lose more money from fees than you would make from the trades themselves. However, a brokerage that does not charge per trade, and only requires a set monthly payment for use would make this a possibility. Slippage is accounted for within these backtests.

In conclusion, extended backtesting with multiple portfolio builds increased the frame of reference enough for me to identify the true strengths and weaknesses of this strategy. I am heading back to the drawing board to create another experimental strategy! 

Final Note: This is not financial advice, do your own research before making decisions. This was build on Pluto trading, I won't be linking anything here out of respect for subreddit rules. I hope you guys have a great night, I look forward to the love and hate in the comments lol!",0.0,Neutral,English

2023-12-26,Becoming a Quant with a non STEM background,"Becoming a Quant with a non STEM background Hi  guys, looking for advice for the best course of action I could take.

# Short version:

I  don't have a STEM background, I like finance, mathematics and  programming and I'd like to get into Quant. I cannot afford to get the  CQF or go back to school to get a Master's or a Bachelor's in a  quantitative domain. Therefore, I believe I have two choices:

* Do  a PhD and choose a theme that is highly quantitative. One of my choice  is HEC Montreal's financial engineering PhD program. (If you have other  PhD programs or schools to suggest, I'm all ears)
* Read  as many scientific papers and books as I can and implement them in as  many projects as possible to be able to build a strong ass portfolio,  publish and share my projects in all the places I can in a mere hope  that someone, somewhere will find them interesting, contact me and  hopefully hire me.

Take  into account the fact that anyone who would be willing to hire me would  have to whether be accepting that I work remotely, or sponsor me for a  work visa, as I live in an extremely small country outside of US,  Canada, Europe and Asia. My area of interest right now revolves around  risk modeling and options pricing. What do you suggest I do, or what is  your opinion?

# Long version:

I'm  22yo, living in a very small country, with no financial markets, and  with probably no opportunities for a nice and fancy career like Quant. I  recently graduated from a school in France, I hold a Master's in  Accounting and finance, with a major in Audit, and I did that in  parallel with a Master's of Research. I do love finance, and back when I  was still a student, I (with two other friends) participated in a  competition, and we ranked 2nd in a worldwide financial modeling  university championship (using MS excel).  
I also like coding and  programming and stuff. I've always wanted to study Software engineering,  but somehow ended up in a business school (probably a result of my poor  decision making process and also because that's what my parents pushed  me to do). But I never stopped loving and being fascinated with coding.  Apart from the classical spreadsheets and office and BI tools, my tech  stack includes python (with data science and data viz library) and SQL.  The projects in my portfolio involves a lot of data scraping, data  cleaning, automated financial analysis, basic ML that tries to predict  things and recognize patterns and images, chatbots using Llama and other  models, basic webapps with flask and so on. I understand that these are  probably not very high level projects, but it's just to express my  interest in programming. I also sometimes do kaggle and datacamp  competitions. Never won and never have been close to do so, but again,  just to express my interest.

  
After finishing my study (a year ago or  so), I started to get more and more interested in finance and a few  months ago, I decided to take the CFA (currently level 1, exam on feb  2024). The more I dived into the curriculum, the more my passion for  finance grew, especially the quantitative part of it.  
With my passion  for finance and programming growing, I figured that's what I wanted to  do for a living. So I searched for the professions that associated both,  and I found that Quant was one of the most challenging ways that  leveraged them.  
I then found this reddit sub (and the other one called quant), and the more I read  about the posts and discussions, about the books and the articles  suggested, the more I wanted to do it. So I did set a goal that I  want to achieve in the next 3-5 years, becoming a Quant.

  
I'm a  relatively fast learner, I love doing research (hence my Master's of  Research) but I understand that I have relatively close to 0 chance of  becoming a quant with my background. However, considering it is  possible, what do you suggest I do? I'm not looking to get into big  quant firms or elite shops or HFs that only look at the elite candidates  with a STEM degree from the top universities, or those that have  decades of experience as a software engineer from FAANG etc. I'm not  even looking to get the 6 figures salary with the 7 figures bonus, I  simply want to get a meaningful experience while doing what I like. I  would even consider doing an internship or work basically for free if  that's what will allow me to get relevant experience.

  
**PS:**

* *I  understand that the quantitative part of accounting and CFA does look a  lot more like high school math for a lot of you, but please be gentle.*
* *Going back to school to get a STEM degree is not likely an option for me  because I do not have the means to study abroad anymore, and the quality  of education of the schools in my country are relatively as good as  youtube videos. A PhD program, like the one I mentioned, is more or less  free and that is why it could be an option for me. This financial  restriction also prohibits me from pursuing the CQF.*",0.0,Neutral,English
2023-07-18,Open-Sourcing High-Frequency Trading and Market-Making Backtesting Tool,"Open-Sourcing High-Frequency Trading and Market-Making Backtesting Tool [https://www.github.com/nkaz001/hftbacktest](https://www.github.com/nkaz001/hftbacktest)

I know that numerous backtesting tools exist. But most of them do not offer comprehensive tick-by-tick backtesting, taking latencies and order queue positions into account.

Consequently, I developed a new backtesting tool that concentrates on thorough tick-by-tick backtesting while incorporating latencies, order queue positions, and complete order book reconstruction.

**Key features:**

* Working in Numba JIT function.
* Complete tick-by-tick simulation with a variable time interval.
* Full order book reconstruction based on L2 feeds(Market-By-Price).
* Backtest accounting for both feed and order latency, using provided models or your own custom model.
* Order fill simulation that takes into account the order queue position, using provided models or your own custom model.

**Example:**

Here's an example of how to code your algorithm using HftBacktest. For more examples including market-making and comprehensive tutorials, please visit the documentation page [here](https://hftbacktest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
